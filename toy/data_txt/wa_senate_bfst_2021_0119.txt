a committee and so every committee now the around business reopening day thought mike the referees committee because it is this windowseat business and economic development is actually in a public hearing tomorrow but you know that that bill has i don't know i think they're six hundred people already signed up for it so i think one of the goals of to day is is to give  this is all focused on the most recent closures and get them up a little bit more time than just the third year sixty seconds they'll get on hearing where you have the people signed up and it'll be fore we go to those all business owners ay for mother deputy secretary he on the committee through the kind of a governor's plan and in terms of reopening and and then i encourage her one of the committee as questions as we go i do not wait till the end with that every farmer you can get rid of the idea that morning i think one came i was for ministry for covered response and do have lines and that i believe are going to be old out perfect and you can move to the next one i'm here in today to talk about the healthy washington road matter and at a high steel the robot includes you know a few meretrices one it is a regional approaching interdependence and reliance on each other and the same resources within our state really to pass at this point and that's really just a recognition of where we are in the pandemic and also a little bit more about that  he has one or soaring on these lines is what a lot of national romance collectorate face and it's really about preserving paste within the health care system when positively limited and that sure that people with conan people who have other emergencies can get access to the care that they need and then face to is a bit were open and you know really the progress towards a gradual return to what we all hope is a more how did they decide on the persevered action as opposed to just a more general like we want to see cases decreasing and hospitalization decreasing what was the rational lessingham that you have later a few spots that have decreasing cases hospitalization is not quite the temperament number that was created here yes think she arsoof measures to the measure the little bit we did look at measures that other states use national frameworks and catron specifically the trees we want to see a meaningful increase and readapted a methodology that used by the world health organization and sisto assassin disease is increasing flat or decreasing in countries or states depending on the organization and so the temper cent you know you think about the levels of disease that we have here having in most parts of the state over fortune day period several hundred cases percent decline is not not a huge one who wanted to see a meaningful decline to show the disease really is receiving and we had to have a new one mention weapons threshold in order to katerina in from a public health perspective so on on the metric pacifically  her you can you can actually got the next flight ceased  as i said the declining cases for moving to face two it has to be a decline and then if you're in face too you can remain there if you are flat or you have and declined so if you're in a certainement change or you had continued to have a decrease you can remain in face too and i see one wilson has a question  this speaks to the four metrics that we have to reach in order to get it will be able to move to the next base what of them is the positivity test how with the department of health and their own admission that their positivity test is not accurate or can't be for a while then how do we get to that point in that particular metric for this measure using positivity of electronically submitted elaborate salts and that way we can't we do have both positive and negative results we are using the period of most recent complete data seven days so and you know positivity is a common metrosideros many states threshold we chose her line up with the highest risk category forces as well as a few other states and we looked at a number of states metric the icy occupancy metronome couple of national frameworks and one of them resolved to say escaped eighty five per cent for the circumcision sulting with our health are leaders and knowing what we know about the numeration washington state we felt like ninety per cent was a reasonable senor i thank you my question on the ice you bed occupancy what was the prior to come in i talked to i see you nurses that have said a basically hospitals try to keep or not try to keep that ninety per cent is basically where they're going to be at anywhere where any ways were as where was a provoked and why we using that if there's no coenties in his bed there so it is true that our hospitals generally do run fairly full especially during the winter respiratory missioning that is interesting this year is that we're having very little blue influence likely to cause a lot of the many of the medication measures we take for cometas protect against flutings like wearing masks and physically distancing the threshold his to ensure that if we are in a surge and suddenly and i also want to say there are people with colin in the ice right now and if we have an increase in cases the hospitalization and the surge into the health care system comes after a rising cases we don't want to get to a place where we are implementing in health care system is called crisis standards of care we are trying to avoid a situation where our state has to make toughness about who gets a ventilator and who doesn't understand that but i talked to our hospital i'm from the south central region and walwala where they have had a covenant in there an ice in weeks and their still at ninety per cent and because that's where the constantini other icy patiens into it but goethes while there there so if we're going to be consistently running ninety to ninety per cent and will never get the lowercase obviously hospitals are going to try to operate it you know they take care of the sick but it's also a business they don't want their fifties at fifty per cent if they've got it polly staff so i think that number whom we also need to look at the cobdenite none are so again trans the two trend measures have to decrease to move to face too and then uarain in face too if you flatter decreasing i see you occupancy antacostia threshold measures they don't move to face too you have to be all four or pastorin we give you the flexibility that you can you can miss one and stay and face too so we do recognize that as businesses are more open there likely will be a little bit of an optic and cases potentially so as well as the community is ready to respond and the business community and the public are gone following the mitigation guidance counties and regions a reasonable chance of staying in face too and some flexibility allowing adressing trends and the toyatte three or four metric in these are and you know to go back to the occupancy were not we do have the data my hospital but it is the occupancy across the whole region so if an individual hospital is quite flat and you can see here these are sisterhood that we ran last friday from this week status there are a couple of regions that are fairly close we will have to  the interesting to look at this week's date because statewide redentore sharp increase in cases in the end of december and early january following the holidays or a couple of regions that are now has three and a couple of others that have two in our pretty close at the point  regarding what is allowed the tried to bring more consistency across activities in a given case and retaken to account  stop for a question as a hand up i have not seen the hands ah you you know you better job of sententiously saderesera things my question is i understand that you have group these into regions but understand that the basic business philosophy is for hospitals not to have empty beds in the hospital in a non compeer are going to have a certain percentage of empty beds which is going to be pretty much what establishing now the same percentage as in a coiner while still basing this on the percentage of empty bedspring with how to accept that whether we do it quite region or we do it you know why by county is still the basic underlying business principle the so i the region the by region was  it is because when we hospitals start getting fuller and the need to transfer patience they transfer within those is regions first or across their system so that was a piece ottomanisation we did consult with the washington state hospital in and the washington edication entreating the threshold and the threshold and then what is recommended nationally he the committee received like like a letter from i think as when the counties in some local departments of health and i reassailed and that by an i guess on the waste the regional thing burst the county approach i guess before was there i never heard with her response to that letter from last week what was the the letter yes we did receive a letter and we are writing a response to that letter yes it is it has not gone out yet   rockahominy he ran hanapepe just basically raised transmitter the committee members of a little right hand side of our point when we all have the green chair and see every place mister herefordshire i actually did both clearly were not paying attention to two focus on your hair  it sort of comment and question so lazy so my understanding from talking to the hospitals you know the whole thing is very difficult to gauge  you know not this is really happened before but my general sense is that the overall goal of of what the state has tried to do since last march and april was to ensure that our hospitals were not overrun like was seen in new york at times a texas early this year what's going on all right now and and so it is that really is that the reason that you've got these metrics on what capacity has to be i mean that seems logical to me so we don't have a situation an outbreak but i understand the concern because it does seem a little bit arbitrary but maybe you could comment on that i do think that's a really really important factor that we have to consider we haven't seen what could happen don't get this right i'm not not in the goal in case one is to ensure that we are not overwhelming our health care system we are fortunate in washington state at our hospitals have an agreement that not the one of them or a region of them would not go into crisis standards of caroline they were fabulous leaves together to ensure capacity across the state and move patience of nederlanders of pure that important and nothingness overconfident when we got the south we also said this is what we're going to try for now and if we learn that we need to adjust it well and we've done that many times already in the panic to send your doors question was there ever any discussion i guess a part of help in of somebody's running let's say at ninety one per cent ice you opacity actual combinations as a cohort within that any one percent are extremely small would that ever fainter decision or is that not something that i guess was like would you view ninety one per cent is the pasty is okay if less than percent of that was patients or with that influence our guides thinking at all or is it just the straight ninety percent regardless of whether there's a high number of potentates from it is right now the straight percent we did talk about covenants both i mean the reality is we all rely on the same coveteth we have it or another life threatening conditions  the next birthstone i do master carpenter in quick comment on this so if we are meeting three of the matrix and because of a business model of a hospital keeps their capacity for and even if you meet the other drengo declining numbers we still count move in that region in the face through two so i think that number should not be i think occupancy should not be used i mean when you look at declining rays we have vaccinations coming out we have declining rates and because of a business modesta we will not get there so you will still emilie is to move in the stage too i think that that needs to be looked at well we will look at it i thank you for the fine back there i do want to point out there are somewhere regions below the ninety per cent of threshold so i appreciate that our hospitals renounce life the hospital this you occupancy is only two regions that are above that threshold right now and were not knowable hospitals about that region but we are looking at the metric for the overall raged and total number of beds in the region going forward so regarding what is allowed in each of the things as you know this is really we tried to bring consistency looking at things is an activity indoors versus outdoors indoors is more risky and you madam reliably since petticodiac can you wear a mask what is the number of people is no fit indoors is their reasonable than elation et cetera and to try to bring as much consistency between the two are between sectors within each phase as possible in i think there were was interest in some assessors and you know just a reminder that activities are safer when you can wear a mask and maintained distance and beyond doors or half relieved with smaller numbers of people i did cooperation of saint say star face to look like before the restrictions that were put in place in november and december and early january and then compare that to face one and face too in the road mounts are some examples of activities that are the most restricted and the reason for not insane are among the most risky activities or sectors of disease is perspective and the infectious disease society of america has an infection of that indenting like going to egotistical i guess every story for as there was a lot of other i mean democratic controlled states and we were old three without inner dining one of three cohesions were were out for fitness in what was i guess the thought process  like the handsomest to our similar to ostensibly fighting covet they like the  governor clear that he felt like i was not a primary place where the spring was happening so i was turned understand because you mentioned that the danaans the spread another officials the country are clearly saying it's not i mean what's your sense of that the well the research suggests that it's risky because you're  when you exercise you are breathing heavily in silent orisons accumulate in an indoor space we have you know we have a way for gems to reopen here and for in northeast happen i recognize it as very restrictive it is very cautious i think the bottom line if we want to reopen our economy as though we have to get our disease rates down and that is going to require all of us working together to sheridan poenitentiae a tool or to box that we didn't have a couple of months ago vaccines so getting more and more people vaccinated we put out information about it yesterday and then we have to all cutting the things that we now work like wearing masks and watching our distance and limiting gatherings on to the next line see how you know this is difficult like i want to acknowledge this is very difficult it is difficult for people as human beings difficult for our businesses and we want to reopen our economy as well we want our families and communities to the ride we are at this point to yesterdays away from our wonder anniversary of the first reporter in washington and we had nearly three hundred thousand cases of cotentin on our stage seventy tousand of those were hospitalized and nearly four thousand of diverting the tension now on this discussion of managing that deadly disease and opening the economy and now i want to remind people this is not for ever we do have hope on the horizon in addition to the machine as the weather improves we're going to be allowed to do a lot more because we can do more outside and the changes and the restrictions that we have put in place or made indifference wielding they have in direst auront benethe have interest aunts i can i can follow up i know i know for both of these merits which states are higher than us so i can follow up and get that information whiteside a place like california that's obviously had the same level of race ructions as washstand has such a huge explosion like what i guess from a department pastepot what's the explanation for that  place like california even with the restrictions that we have in place we think they've had such an explosion of cases it's a good question i have not deeply reviewed their nathan a few articles that have come out about the growth in southern california and particular and you know there was a lot of holiday related gatherings and in southern california particular around the thanksgiving through  december time tram that is believed to be a factor you know benilo want to point out is not one single factor for any of this we you know it is all of our collective activity all of our collective mobility all of our interactions you know the virginians there i guess that sort ever been any adept met palamon ever the risk what you say from my l county where the long term closure seemed to lead to a lot more people just doing in home gatherings that endowing the reverse effect and is out something that department helberson of how long you have the closure is for and you end up by elocutionary so assessing against the factory i do understand that we have to keep the public with us and the business community with us and you know we do think that we want to keep going forward that is our goal and we want to give people more and more to do as safely as possible the chalons were walking a very fine line right now are cases race we are if you go back one line were forty infante nation from castrates races are among the highest and benrachett at the highest another close and tremendous arose and on to that disease level down because vaccines are here but we get a hundred thousand doses a week it's going to take several weeks to months before we have enough of our sixty five an older population and highly vulnerable populations vaccinated to to you know prevents the deteriores of their you know agitations yes we do factor you know we understand that people are tired of the panic we understand that we have to keep them with us in terms of compliance and following you know our guide as well as the restrictions or policies that are in place you know and we also are goal has been from the beginning and continues to be to try to save as many lives as possible and we look at that hole italy and avoid severe more vanity and if you go to the night side  i mentioned that you know nearly washingtonians have died that's you know we very lost for their families and friends and our communities but we have done relatively well as a state and a few song there was a new york times article by steamer variation and he recorded the first study seven descents country easington state first city seven out of outfitters fifty through all of the mitigation reassures you know almost a year later in months later we ran  they the analysis is the us had followed a model like ours or how a similar death rate two hundred and twenty thousand people when be alive in the united states today that are not so i do recognize us part we recognize this so hard but we also recognize you know that were making a difference and we want to thank washingtonians one of the thankfulness for helping us on that mission you come back to the committee of the states that are i guess what they're doing the  i can  i think there coercionist life enormous hastening in he thought he had got her then we'll try to get to the kaytherine fitness sanders obviously with shut down fitness sanders weinstein you have one person for five hundred square feet but i question the numbers bedouret still so why why can live it is industry and the numbers aren't there that maybe that's where the springing stairs or indoors are there subject to the same requirements as penteconters so they can practice since mangostine or six people and that is because they have the sarissas an outdoor sport may have to practice outdoors but they have a little a little more flexibility they're not allowed to do competitions currently my basketball plays i mean he got ten people on it on a cork that's ninety feet long and seemed and i don't think that there is only one within a five hundred square foot area play the game so understood your asking about college i have so colonel scorn and washington statesmen and tallowed to play because they can take measures above and beyond on the general public or a high school and in terms of screening testing protocols and isolation corentin as needed the stones of the college football basket not just those parts all of this sport we review the conference plan senators question and then we might try to move on to get to casinoes heartache their stories  you your coming of earthen you mister chair so you know i've been really on the front line of this since april being in the national guard or running these food bags and my wife works in the nursing home my son was also out there in the food banks i have had to issue an a lot of mercy leave because similies are parents died from gobelet patents taken out because one person had covenanted but my my real concern is i think the only way to get out this is the back scene but what was shocking is to seeing one's offered at least in in the military side was two thirds of our service members i take it used and we had and in my wife working eraser pertolepe didn't want to take it which a very shocking and hearing different groups were large numbers of individuals refused to take the back scene whatever reason i'm just wondering the plan for educating some of these folks because i know the modeling is showing how we're going to get out there if we take the back scene but i don't i don't think the modeling looking at the facts so many people are refusing this vaccine and the reason i example for the world i take the back scene well first thank you for your service in the national guard and in support of our correspondent we could not do this without all of the great partnerships and incredible partnership in particular with the national guard it's a great question and we are now saw the announcement yesterday are you know enough to really squash this down if you will from a father perspective we are concerned and we do want to make sure that many people who are eligible thus to take the nacherally started a campaign in the fall and tantamounou this nice work because it's a new type of vaccine and ravine and we have a series of messages that will come out over the next several months encouraging people take the matamoras doing some work with community outreach consultants contractors from communities and color and different types of various geographies of across the state and different types of problems though that trust in voices are standing up and supporting the vaccine and encouraging members of their communities take the vaccine and of course to the degree possible really encouraging leaders who are willing to take the attention and areopagitica had the thank you so much deputy secretary far back for being here i really appreciate all your time i know allamistakeo and an open or not and so the folks were the restaurants first and a people that have your comments to the shower comments the more time there is for interaction back and forth borneon and tom the sebastocrator that'll be sure who jenny from the owner was fair and merry ciphering and and rachel brink in england they do mister chair members of the comedie i appreciate the syrian today very much in your effort try to save main street which is in crisis and also united to beat the virus i think we're all aware of how hard hospitality has been hit we've all seen the figures of you know six figures loss an employment at the height of is the second order of lodging entertainment full service or down just short of eighty per cent of their business here over a year and is reported back in september we've already lost over two thousand hostility businesses next time and while those are tragic i think the prone on the major issues is the tragedy continues and with being closed each month that were closed the debt bills for small businesses we worked with a company of becanchen now and perishers has over six hundred clients in the putney compare people's fix costs in december to be able to fix costs a year ago in two thousand nineteen and the average restaurant still had about twenty five thousand dollars of the same case occurring in the methodologies in debt in full restaurants it is just so tough to make a living on these margins and this rest be for disaster can you look on the excited and yet we know we can operate safely to recurring these debts or single his clothing and yet we know that prior to november we actually worked with dah and the governor's office in creating some of the strictest comin guide lines in the country we were telling a different story that a lot of the rest of the country and yet we were still shut down forty five of the states are now allowing indoor dining according to the state of new york and another progressive state they found that just one point four per cent of their cases were connected to restaurants  we actually beat that number here in washington our own contract trading using planks and lochaber from the lesson one half percent in cases were coming from restaurants we know that a well regulated restaurant can provide a safe place to gather rather than driving to people and as i said earlier and what we're seeing around the country though without a safe place to go they're going to the unregenerate and private settings are accounting for one of the major drivers of the virus and then bring in that home and spreading it in our homes and so we might to get back to doing overdoing safely and back december it provided the tootity to learn because so many of the states for the whole unpardoning something differently if we incline like on the next slide please a canister of capacity if you look at every state and where they were that had a mask mandate so we had a similar isolation similar approached to attacking the virus the death percept of her you can see the clothes indoor states actually had the second highest and stay in a loud seattleite per cent actually were able to lower their number of deaths compared to the other states there was a lot of mix in these states each one of his groups as the west and east tamanrasset a democrat and republican these are mixed and yet it shows people need a safe place to go and when we work together we know we can do this i know a lot of questions and i was asked to keep my opening comments of two minutes so i could love her questions so that senator anything i can help with why i have not seen that one and definitely please recommitted that's really interesting filbert to actually see the state i guess that falleth your question senator states like maine or appearing as in there in that sixty six per cent and then sat like california new york that were closed in in the time frame you know we're we're having by harder worse rati can share that asticot a question for amerigo to be the actual so i think we have showerbath owner of salingen i would thank you very much said a committee i'm here to just share my story and i'm sure no one hitalian group here in adminstration in the cheffonier with a couple of partners of mine and we have a portfolio but fiesta rants in edmonson and full serving business this the shutdown has deeply impacted or business might family personally and over two hundred melees are first showdown we laid off about two hundred employees in the second one subsequently fifty employees thereafter now i'd like to say that the restaurant industry is heavily regulated we are probably the most regulated with least return in any other industry combined and what we do is we survive were able to adapt were able to follow instructions we feel that we should be used as a tool slow the spread of dic and  what one example is that every single server cook dish washer manager to go through a helpful safety standard tests just to work in a restaurant setting and that is just typifies a restaurant industry can  we've done many things like cavity can see behind me build a door dining areas this is my seventh one again i am the chef of the company i am not a carpenter and i'm doing this myself because i need to do it as for a matter of survival and  i can't afford a carpenter to be honest and pay double price after materials so i'm desisting for you guys to move forward and open mind and consider us as a tool just like you consider the most personal nurses hospitals health care workers we are here and what you fight if you have any questions on her answer then your sale like a man the change in sales for you then from the recent the closure from november now so fortunate my restaurants have collectively lost a word almost half a million dollars and and sales and i was osay it's fifty per cent and profit and one of them is actually profiting only because if we call it a big donald's of our restaurant profits a quick service and easily adaptable to the situation because of take up we are in the mode of survival and trying to break free of death and this the shadows or helping even though we feel like we are one to contribute to the safety standards of those diners the questions for she were inattentive owner of alice fear and went out to animistic or estate as one sober good morning senor thank you for the opportunity to speak to day my name is jenny rosenstein my husband and i own to restaurants and went out she the tiresome founded by my inland nineteen ninety one the tires auraient for over thirty years my husband and i took on ownership by the years ago the full service restaurant at castle we've been able to remain open which had got only services while her other restaurant apples pare is currently closed we spent eighteen months building atmosphere only to open on january first twenty twenty and close eleven weeks later we have seventy two seats at alicant opera more fine dining experience it's a business that added to the economic growth of our city and one that are local community came out in droves to support when we first opened alice's inside of a multi story building was no set of her take out an easy access for people to pick it up even if we could we were able to open during the limits of occupancy phases before shutting down again in november night the marest rants have the option for outdoor dining or to become an open air an since march we laid off over twenty employees the impact of my employees and my concern for them is one of the primary reasons i'm sure to day we consider employes family and we have a culture of internal promotion and skill building which results in long turn careers and low turn over the majority of our team have never been unemployment want to work i just can't from a financial perspective as an owner i have two very different restaurants and it makes it very rough at one and impossible at the other an atlas were going out a complete closure over twenty one weeks and this past year and counting the bills had not stopped and even if there were expenses we could have saved money on even small ones like cable the moving target date made that impossible so we weren't able to adjust effectively combination of having one business partially open and of working a full time day job means that i am staying a float but every week we have to reassess what he looks like there are so many restaurant owners couples women first generation families have the one restaurant there really struggling to keep afloat like what's happened appear they may not have been able to pivot or had the resources to do so dining restaurants are prone for so many reasons their job creators they bring creativity and diversity to communities and their space where people can safely celebrate from engagements to anniversaries to new business deals what we need is the ability to reopen and the confidence that we can stay open reopening our piranesi capital and mentor cleaning preparation restating and under the same current plans the fact that we could open up and encloses week later makes it makes it too high a capital rest to engage we have some of the satellites to meet tables are six feet apart disposable manus staff and mask sanitation and health checks plus we can regulate traffic through systems like reservations when it comes to the santafior i would say reopening twenty five per cent is going to be very hard for our industry but it's a start that we desperately need to bring some of our employees back and cut down the losses thank you for your consideration yes thank you mister chairman and to both jenny and to shower thank you for your testimony we appreciate hearing it to two questions maybe you could respond to one is could you describe for us the situation with your your rancour fixed cost with your landlords and how if you have them and how that is work in terms of any kind of abatement and whether you know keep or any of these state assistance you've been able to obtain and then secondly when we talk to the economists for rely in june we heard we heard about states where one side of the one state everything we shut down other state were open but the fall of and business was the same in restaurants and commercial establishments et cetera because people were not feeling safe and i guess my question is for that during that period where you were able to operate between say the first opening and then that the shutdown and november were you operating at the full limits of what was available to you or wish you were you not even at those levels as thank you sir we are operating to the full limit and we had weightless for people together we created safe and by her mansarde community knowing that we were appearing to everything to keep them safe they wanted that place to go out to and so most nights we had booked reservations on night and we could not have more people come in and i think reservations systems are one of the unique ways in which restaurants kid insure that we keep the correct traffic flow in the number of people in our buildings to answer your question about financials then the bills have stayed the same trout the entire time i would say or landlords had been flexible on paying rent late if in editha's puts the buck down the road that doesn't actually provide any thing financial relief kept we were one of the first restaurant to get that in april the stipulations then was that you had to spend it all by june so that resource completely was depleted very quickly the best relief we could have is the opportunity to operate or business and to allow the public to make their own decisions on whether they want to come out and dine with us we were really proud of the safety to standards that we utilization to reopen her bisness sure as you go back on that you want to enter centerton turns to where you were at compartmented also all the tools that we could and reach the extent of those rules for dining capacity we implemented very safe dining and had industrial strength sanitating methods from our dishwashing company and chemicals to santacroce we've also installed the air ducking and things like that that alcibiades in the air but creating a safe space was our ultimate goal people did feel safe as they came out and we were able to keep a instances loiters covering and outbreaks if there were any at all from customers and employees like i'd like to save for the three or four months in the summer time that we were serving customers of his persepolitan one severiorum casing servers and everything like that and social distancing in such i did take the people as well for quite a few of our units and you know exhausted those find pretty much pretty quickly because it was not designed for restaurants and mind but we use it in bestiality are or open up blithedale as well and interwound say these two stories match what we hear from the rest of the state of over was actually a good month in the creativity and innovation of operators between to go and and trying to find out or dining rule was to work on exeter october we are starting to find a way to make this work with fifty per cent and then to have it removed again was really heartbreaking and then to sicily use triple repairers at sixty per cent of that loan i spent on labor so we need to get open we did employ people to actually get the relief to small businesses and so theatergoing available in february that will help moving forward provided were but if we're not open we are missing the true value of triple  lamothe owner of icicle growing in

are there any questions for any one the restaurant group before  very much accelerated and parasite you okay the next one is going to be shillabers she executive director of the branchville chamber of commerce in comment was just she set a specific topic i think of just the parts estate getting go to face to the majority of the state they go to faith to back in june but there was a segment of the state that state face one point five i think those are going to be shut remarks earthman and members of the committee yes monitor the record my name is chiabrera i am the executive director of the nacelle chamber of commerce the leconte for the chamber we have served businesses and bold chelan and douglas counties since the beginning of the pandemic working very closely and perish if as their local help district produced resources to help businesses support their employees protect their customers and understanding the changing regulatory environment as a chairman state in my hope to day is present some of the universal challenges facing the employers and employees located in calendulas ventral and acamas who remained in phaenomenon until october thirteenth when they were collectively moved into face too so in twenty twenty restaurants fatteners entertainment businesses many of the folks should hearing from to day in these counties face the most restrictive oaring opening environments in the state fitness centers of these counties on average had eleven weeks of regular operation six weeks of modifying operations and thirty five weeks of closures entertainment businesses like movie theatres or bowling alleys on average had eleven weeks of regular operations for weeks of modified operations and thirty seven weeks of closures restaurants in these counties on average had eleven weeks again of regular operations twenty one weeks of modifying operation and twenty two weeks of closures this is resulted in significant long term unemployment in these counties and when looking at the major cities in these five counties the eastercove up through november that on average will start with wenatchee unemployment rate has been nine per cent which is up from five quietive per cent and twenty nineteen jacamar ording an average of nine point three per cent of unemployment throughout the year up from six percent in twenty nineteen kenwick's reporting an average of eight point four per cent of unemployment in twenty twenty up from five point four percent in twenty nineteen richlander ng an average of seven point seven per cent unemployment up from four point six per cent in tontine and pass to is reporting on average nine point one percent of unemployment up from six point four percent in twenty nineteen however when these five counties were moved in the face too were all businesses were able to operate unemployment reduce significantly and october twenty twenty unemployment rate in these same five cities the major metropolitan areas for these counties and when at it was five point eight per cent and acamas five point nine per cent in canoes five point five percent in richly was four point seven per cent an impasse was five point seven percent but sadly since the new shutdown order issued on november fifteenth twenty two thousand two hundred twelve people had filed new unemployment claims in these counties alone these lampshade psychological and physical impact on the people who experienced them and the families they are part of everything from depression anxiety negative reception of self were to wait gain safe deserves and heightened stressing conflict within their family systems on owllike to argue that these individuals deserve the same level of support protection commitment to get them back to work as we are putting into protecting people from the fires job creation and welcomes in washington state happens at a significant resource than washington's urban counties and retaining these jobs of a business closes as difficult and time consuming accordingly is even more important in these regions of all businesses in our state have the opportunity to open safely and as quickly as possible if we're going to save as many as the abbess as possible so here's a few thoughts about how you can assist businesses need a consistent and participial regulatory environment to plan against the current plan does not provide this for them businesses need cash flow and access to capital businesses the relief programs to have been helpful in critical life lines but our businesses have not had the access to cash flow at the velocity of the need to be sustainable businesses need customers who are confident that they are safe businesses have been incredible partners and developing implementing the health guidance issued by the scented wage wenever one championing how business is across the state had become protectors and not in factors if our businesses are going to survive this pandemic they need your help to help retain jobs that are communities especially the sort have been disproportionately impacted because they remained in a modified face one point five for so long we need them to all be allowed to open safely and sustainable providing clear more predictable regulations for their operations in this pandemonium clear a timely communication when issuing regulatory or help changes that will impact their businesses and employees and ensuring that they are not settled with increases it increases in taxes based that a petheril ty to hire the employees back so i at conclude my comment there and welcome any questions from the committee what was the gap between and in and then the closure was an leave week gap between when they are allowed to go to face two and when things were even he was less than that and we clewer eminence to an october thirteenth and then we were closed back down on november seventeenth and so for some businesses it took them several weeks to get their staff back trained in their facilities operational and so they didn't even get the full opportunity to operate for those four weeks mary much kate next group is from the fitness set sector and so we have larminie she started from the main bridge but let a club incarnation she is a personal trainer in vancouver and bread shorts from questioned leicester mullen committee thank you very much for the opportunity my name's armytage president and she confluence fitness partners we operate to health clubs in the unachievable one in boltonparty one inclination in douglas county and you think i probably the way famette testimony so far heavily when actually governor we had nine months of zero revenue and our clubs in the last a year i have signed a forbearance agreement with my bank after not missing a single payment and never being late and still have not they come to me and said that your cash flow is out of compliance with your covenant therefore we need to renegotiated and a lot of businesses like minor cut into this spot and that is that the economic ecosystem that's happening in those banks is having a massive impact on lateral businesses we started with about seventy four employees when we closed in march about thirty six of those were full time equivalents we were down to two employees during the lowdown genius both on when tacking about how the cow the peptone went same with us under were operating with square feet or pertinent temper persant passed we brought back about thirty employees about seven full time equivalence so be a very slow ramakins president of software company called existance member experience metrics we works specifically in the fitness vertical were partly on by publicly traded company called madelia to the last six years we have worked with dad in the fanciest globally we have customers in i united kingdom finland us canada during the lock down ninety eight percent of those customers were shut down with an about a two week period globally amecameca the nexus of data collection for understanding as clubs open and collecting data on chickens virus ratios within those chickens and became part of the research team for ursa ursuline national detracts porcupin on ice spear head the work with the university of oregon in analyzing checking data along without break data and a case data for the mercy of colorado been involved in working with the new york state and its alliance and overcome california fine alliance arizona nevada in july i realized that i should probably to take some of our data and some of our efforts and bring them here to the state of washington of the washington sideline in july we quickly and about the three hundred members in the washington finalmente working with the governor's policy came to set statesman as part of the same standard team that withers the create active and safe start programme which we are part as our most of the clubs in the state of washington i served on the global health anticollision research and would ailward myself up as a resource to the the governor's office we have brought clear data clear facts about our industry and its it should be no secret as to why their outbreaks coming out to the penitent there clear reasons why that happens right now i'm very concerned about the studios in our state studios are not able to operate in the space one and at the very beginning at the very beginning of this in face to those studios like to hear from in a minute safely for the entire time when large clubs couldn't open now larger clubs are open in our studios were closed stop i'll stop right there with respect to time and case there's any question questions  wilson  he shot a where i do have a question as you said that you had been working with the governor and during the course with your information have you been at the table recently with this five hundred square foot requirement mostly become as a great question could mostly become reactive early on we were really involved in the process than they were including a interest in helping to actually write out of some of the some of the guidance because we understand operations the battered is really what god larger clubs to be able to inspect months ago back in i forget it what may july early august we also work to help move clubs out of face one point five and in the face point face too as time has gone on a process has seemed a changehouse reporting back to you know back to us process where if there was engagement to condone the fine the guide lines its now more in now somebody's going in a roman deciding and then coming back to us and saying here's the guidance we be able to do outrages but mostly around for example this latest guidance was that you know no work out longer than minutes we got them to say less than an hour so that they could understand really how it system work and help people track labour in alencon apotheola i know that i think throughout a bit i've been hearing that a lot of the fitness centers were upgrading their age pays em and you know to the help heifers and incinerating about that too could you let it how many have done that i know that i was a great expense to most and what at the things i want to point out is that help cubieres we've been dealing with respiration for a long time so when our cascades are designed as engineers come in and they look at your one hundred percent actionable which you never had they look at that and they look at people exercising in an extremely high heart ray during that time than they designers em around this so for example in my own club in the winter we turn hernoesand percent of the air stickier we usertesen filtering we've invested about a hundred and fifty seven thousand dollars in our two clubs just to add what are called airfields infect the air that's even coming coming through those systems in the summer we turn the rover ten to fifteen times an hour the system he clubs i divide have over engineered patate so i hear that inside activity is dangerous it's not that binary it's just not that finery and help clubs amenable to mitigate that and deal with this better than anybody but one of about ten really good reasons why they're not saying outbreaks them  he sheltered the banbridge bedaub quick i go morning and thank you everybody for your time and for listening to the stories from our industry i really do appreciate it my name is shelley stockman i operate a health club here on bainbridge island and i guess what makes it a story may be a little bit unique a very big resource in in a relatively small community and when we are out of service it really takes a lot of services and a lot of air out of the community we had had sixty employees were now re opened again with about half of that but we had to lay most people off on the first round of closure on the second round enclosure we tried to keep everybody i couldn't stomach ran people off during the holidays when there was no aid so we bore that expense and kept everybody working as much as we could through the end of the year the type of member that we serve here is everything cradle degree we have toddlers in here we have lavender tenscore have a pool we have a gymnasium that we offer up to the community for their use for braceway in good health can i can i get a doctor not or anything and i had to say no to that i think that one of them is but our commander as is that we just get the better and we don't we do that really well but we also saved lives we also get people off their medication we also help them be friends we also give them a sense of belonging in a sense of community and what's happened since the close not only lost about penobscot business in our community that we hope support have suffered as a result of our closure we've done all the things that are just mentioned i don't know any operator that hasn't done all the pall the plexiglass all of the air scrubbers they have taken the money and put it to really good use to try to keep people safe we didn't have any outbreaks of weenepauweekin that she was positive played with twelve different people and no one got sick and so i know that we can keep people safe and i guess just last just understand that entrepreneurship is really really really hard i personally years ago put all of my life savings and to disclaim borrowed millions of dollars to try to make a difference in a community and entrepreneurs in general are really great creative group and we just want to help with this we want to put our resources behind the state and behind all of you come and work in partnership with you to try to save lives we know that health save lives we know that this pandemic doesn't affect healthy people as much as it does vulnerable people and we just want an opportunity to do what we do best which is a business is run the safe land he safe people and do excellent any for before we next sharing mc millan and sharing of personal trainer over harmony thank you so much for this opportunity to speak and share my experience my name is sharing macmillan and i've been in the finistere for thirty years and the owner of northwest personal training and banking on it a small training studio and were actually celebrating our twenty first anniversary this very much and twenty twenty was definitely the hardest year that i have ever experienced in my professional career i have never worked so hard to survive and provide some level essential servants to our clients on considering we've been closed or severely restrictive for the majority of the year as the typically we have experienced it to an erasement five thousand dollar loss and revenues in twenty twenty which is a really significant amount of money for a small business the income of all seventeen of my team members have been severely reduced through the entire year two of my employees have left the finest for good they onnoticed they're not no honor confident in their you know ability to work in the fenians for the long term in the snow light of the end of the tunnel and so they are gone into other professions one of my employees was never able to even access unemployment this whole year mother really big concerns are just the impact to clank confidence and long term business i liability for is important to note that our services are essential to our clients it's not about a six pack i think sometimes that perception is about the entity in a six pack and it's not not essential services the average age of our clients is fifty years old services recovering and overcoming breast cancer heart disease parkinson's at divers disabilities obesity diabetes injuries and so many other elements and when i think about the long term of not only my business but our industry we've got we're dealing with extended closures were dealing with the uncertainty you know the future of our business and the industry and just the unpredictability of the mandates going week to week and having said what can we do next week we have no idea in it makes it so incredibly challenging to plan and you know the finest has been disparaged through this whole process by telling consumers you know regularly that were not safe and that's just not true when you look at the date in the science reports we are not unsafe and it will be an uphill battle to regain clanconan encourage them to return to jim and into the facilities twenty percent of fitness facilities have already closed for good state in across the country which will have devastating long term consequences to the health of our state the mandates are destroying the entire health of vinicius try which is the absolute last thing we should be doing tutelaries initially the closure was for two months we personally use that time and tens of thousands of dollars to restructure our entire facility to get ready to reopen and with very strict safety protocols in place we reopen the beginning of june we upgrade our age back system completely cleaned out her decks we created individual work on stations for all of our clients and trainers so there was no cross contamination between equipment and between clients we had a barrier between equipment we reduce capacity to twenty five per cent reenacting with intent and health checks of staff and clients we offered group classes virtually and outdoors to come out of the indoor setting so we were just focusing on private one and one training are them was so diligent and we experienced zero cases among staff and clients the entire time that were open so it was absolutely shocking and so disheartening and devastating when we were closed again in november the second closure has been even more challenging because now there was no peeping available and december and january in our business and in the finest as a whole are the most critical time periods for a business and we were shut down we take however seriously and we always always always have been in the finest one under present committed to the health of our community like this this is what we do which is why we need to be open so that we can be part of the solution all the science proves that our services helped to keep people healthy and actually reduced the risk of coming to all disease in illness including comet in fact there was you know just a recent study that showed that in the mild clinic proceedings just recently january twenty twenty one proved that fit individuals are less likely to be hospitalized judicatae actually reduced the string on the medical system the chicago medical society representing seventeen thousand oppositions in medical health professionals has advocated for the opening of finicality for this exact reason the danish shows that we are doing a great job executing safety protocols the washington state department of health illinois that ginger not the source spread the washington state of great report shows an end desideria that fine facilities are sure of outbreaks were just not the problem were part of the solution it makes no sense to penalize a sector that according to data science and studies has not been a source of covenant has proven that i can safely provided valuable service to the public during health endemic it does make sense that people need a safe and structure place to exercise and focus on the physical and mental health the stress relief and their munster all critical things now or than ever so much for listening when you write much cherrystone ateliers on a fine face was broad it was guest and to our panorama thank you mister chair senators my name's brad swords i own to fitness centers and piercing king county i formerly owned vision quest worthiness which was large as privately epithets in the futon area so those two alpines and we had five hundred and forty employers and we were voted best of western washington for years in a row this new company that we started in percipient we had a hundred and fifty employes would previously had five hundred and forty our customers are all ages from age for all the way to a hundred with this closer i had just invested six million dollars on to notations one of the opener and one in the polarity beating up the bathing years of experience here me closure five months starting to new businesses as many of the other stated it's hard enough to be an entrepreneur without all these other obstacles impact for us we had to lay off a hundred and fifty employees virtually everybody and on the second closure in business for years twenty per cent of my best employees went other places because of the fear of not being able to get their jobs back in the fitness industry sixty five per cent loss of revenue the thousand twenty over two thousand nineteen terenty percent of the boys will not be coming back stephen cynanche was a consultant for track and filled the limpid again and reiterates the more part of the solution it part of the problem exercise stimulates the immune system the opposite a true sedentary life sales increased virtually all diseases so when we talk about building the mune system and creating antibodies exercise of the absolute best thing you could do to accomplish that lose fitness quickly studies in the fitness industrious adverse i and physiological changes occurring after two weeks of decrease the averted face the phrase sorosis research has shown that the reduced activity reduced as blood by of blood and the reduction of the antibodies that helped fight these viruses  a part of finance which is a vendor during the pandemic they invested eighty million dollars of attracting system for members on their egress in digressions so we are able to unlike a lot of businesses minute a minute we know how many people are in our club and how many people are leaving our clubs in the entire five men shut down through the whole endemic two petticuts had zero cases a canter in the paper had zero cases we feel that were part of the solution we feel that were one of the safest places in the world to be if you were out twice awake statically nationally sadistic show that you're the top one percent of americans foreigners so you're one hundred per cent masculine apertures coming into the facilities are employed checking temperatures and being a part of a washington fitness alliance absolutely compliance to all the  i was a drop in the bucket for most of us and it was very hard to have this moving target how many employes were going to bring back and then how many we had to terminate again and your star of sometimes takes more operating capital than just staying close train again when we're going to go back to some type of normalcy per cent to one given fighting start to get back into business and start to get the flow business thank you and if there's any questions unpreserved a little time for questions questions  that was an excellent much for sharing her story and i wrap the comment from the fitness in his tree extraction were only focused on the businesses that were imparted by the november closures going to be a museum and his abettors executive actor of that and on children's museum  hello thank you and i do have some slides i next light i just want to give you an over feather about eight children museums in washington state three hundred nationally and twenty nineteen we served are we had our best here on to date three hundred twenty three thousand visitors so with two closures and limited reopening its been a really last year was a very tough year of life the other common that you've heard we felt really strongly that there was miss perception about children's museums since touch a lot of things in children's museums and we've been serving them in a healthy way for many years next line  i we were very tractive about trying to reopen the museum because we know that children under the age of eight don't learn well through a digital media we when should may not know is that many children museums also serve a large percentage of low income and underserved families and so we maintained that commitment through the coopered were also been doing and have been doing alternative service for a wittenbach creativity kids a thousand of them out from this museum alone  when the things that all of us thought about in our reopening was that we were going to do it on based on best practices this is just an example of the healthy advisory committee that we put together prior to opening and has been with us the entire year obviously just like all the other industries you've heard from we had to assess our facility we did the same kind of investments we are a non profit all the children's museum in washington state are and we put a lot of money into reopening the first time and we expect we will have to do a little bit more for the reopening second time next line we partner with others like mary bridge and altiere for the healthy family interest ation we started it from the outside so that the expectations were set next line just like with restaurants were using mandatory priest ration and to our times intrusions as a way to manage how many people are in the building were keeping people moving we keep air flow air flows maximized and because we're doing with kids and families and older population we have a coincide super riser during all open hours  the thing that worries a lot of people is how many props there are in an archaean other children's museums we had to remove about half the props off of the floor and we are going by the model that guess in her with clean hands we only allow the same group of people in for two hours every prop in the place is replaced in the thirty minutes between sessions and all day long are cafe has turned into a prop washing station and so even the outdoor props because we have an outdoor space or are rotated each night next life one of the things we do is solicit feedback from visitors with the staff to see how they feel about the safe environment were providing when we do get strongly disagree in typically is a protest against were in face covering or following protocols  i see back has been positive very positive of throughout the whole four months that we were able to re open much as you've heard from the other industries next light next light so the challenge like the others that you've heard from is that children's museums are about seventy five per cent and revenue in the state and we were down eighty four per cent or over year between march and december are contributed revenue held steady we started with about eighty five employees prior to covet and i now have about thirty six many of our lines of business were suspended during this time and i can answer any questions so when they were you able to re open some are you able to reopen in june but not waiting because we were a little nervous about public perception and we wanted to make sure we have everything right osterhout we were in as you saw we were extremely reduced capacity we were only about fifteen to twenty per cent of our our building during the any one session  you have and so that he were there any outbreak cases repairing that four miles there was we were closely with the health department and there was not a single case reported back either through staff or through visitors to the museum  i think just listening to everybody to day i mean we know that there are there are businesses than that are perhaps needs work but i think most of us went into this to say how can we protect the people we serve and the people that work for us and we feel like we've come up with some pretty good was to do it so were hopeful that when we do reopen we have some assurance that if we're following and were in compliance that we won't have to shut down again like a fair revery much prayer much hester's any questions i mean seems as your person is we had a lot of museums throughout at impacted but just given time we only were able to hear from what we feel the next is going to be bowling alleys moored rick from shelley to come the morning everybody you do not look like the big basket morning senators first off i'd like to put my heart and thought out to everybody whose penetrative nineteen this toothpaste year masipele many of my colleagues and my second generation by proprietor since ninety four my families owned an awkward and washington's oldest bonesetter shabaka which was established in intention been eleven months in the missile sat down in march and bonesetter for two and a half of those months slaves down sixty five per cent of frontier perspective or boone's the host two hundred burhale to cover our fixed cost so as the only source of income for my father my wife and i as we portersville business began monotone savings and have a personal inarticulately we were issued approval for my financial institution in the not have to paramore months and my wife and i received a six month for beginners before the sun down the only mystery washington employed twenty five hundred people because of the shut down on percent of those employes had been forced to cut unemployment benefits artemisia has been reduced from nine cicero no healthy washpan ollinger are only loud to have six people six people from the same household at a time facilities  not a line with any societies coal set up by the sands as not to table going back to our comments from the finish if you want to compare that to titus there allowed to have one person for five hundred square feet i wrote the house six people are facility on our or bones are twenty two thousand square feet which provides ample space for that proper social distancing needed this new plan associates so much uncertainty to to the week by week assessment of each original district the sincere is the imaginable for most households let alone businesses better reliant on so many a bolero to open the share we did so at a reduced occupancy a thirty four per cent kitinda was only eleven weeks that we are laura we hear a city ceilings along with some industries most strict coaxing pauses and procedures which were all approved by the governor's office one outbreak was reported from our facilities but one five of the states have proven a bowling work during this pandemic why can't washington my family i desperately want to bring her camera serenity and support our vendors unfortunately under the new plan there is no predictability on when or for how long i will escape  in closing in our family has gone through for recessions this is the first time since march i had real doubts the vivacity of away also the entire industry for washington state what we get in to face to there's no clear guidance a hamlet operate in twenty five percent enquired frankly for some less than will make sense to reopen only sentimentally callings are fighting for a livelihood if you feel it's right i urge you and you fell genestas and bill fifty one fourteen we had a fine chance for a backstay supporter community and chearlie life i thank you for your time and consideration he remotely those were for  we also have bowing as well we have any williams the milanese spoken and i realize i skipped over and cook from what we ettersberg back to you after the comments from many  at the morning thank you senator i appreciate the time like billy o i run the folly enervation i've been here fifteen years they had large pointer on the eastern side of the state and like billy said you know this industry is a pillar in a later communities we provide a rioting for repeal needs we hold speculator or facility prior to a mariterangi entertaining a thousand boston include open play that does include birthday parties were sitiation for a later people on a weekly basis lanistae for granted in that easthope of what ballindine community in brinksome together and with it that being said the opportunity when we sat down for a time it gave us a chance to reassess our business we did a lot of improvements we sanitized we we did our facility we read it or flooring we made it so that a facility was going to be a safe place for people to come in and there when a scene the investment that we did for them for the safety of all of our african we have pressed groups we have seniors we have kids and what we wanted to do was provide a safe environment for them to come into and during that time we have a very very positive outlook in the future bowing because we knew that we could do what it took to make sure that we were part of the solution and so being close rotundity two days we felt very good when we have opportunity to reopen and when we did open we we opened a seventeen per cent and that two people praying while werther to a bowling center that's not a lot of people and yet we figure out how to survive we had we have such a great support system in our community here in spokane that were able to the worried at that time the second closure really heard us because we went from forty employees down to seven like billy said six people is unrealistic it in our facility which we have thirty thousand square feet six people you can't tell what's going on in our building but you know our community requires in desires us to be here and soon as we realise they are here so we know the power of what we offer because we do fundraiser likenesses of annually have pruned groups come in then their form of exercise they enjoy this this is what they look for to once a week you know are labourers this is what they look for to once a week they come in socialized with their friends they wear their masks were extremely safe we socially distance naturally because the lame beds allow us to socially distance this is a great great industry across the country and across our state and we offer so many things to the locals that no oenotrian offer you know an kids come here this is entertainment is inexpensive is built to withstand a number of different things pandemonious industry and so the challenge of operating with justice is quite daunting but if twenty fraternity right now i think going into the summer we would have a fight jacovello for it did you have any outbreaks at a during it time you were open for that brief having the outrage we did have a couple of people who did come in require did find out that they testified and we at one one day we did so down because we were concerned and we took the aggressive nature of cutting down reclining and reopening but we have never had any one come in and actually test positive for facility but we origination from the person who tested so tenebrous a question had yet thank you thank you this is to mister williams and mister siberia the in looking at the phase one guidance for indoor recreation fetishes the limitation was the you're saying is six indicates and maybe this was a special rule that he put out an old one customer athlete pervided square feet if you get thirty thousand square feet that is loose and how many people there are allowing under those guidelines verses separate guidelines and i'm missing share with you what i heard the answer i was given as to why we were received six people was because they wanted to be consistent with restaurants that is so to us operatives but you have thirty thousand square until facilities is so you too presumably you could have ten you could wonderful have more than that obviously tall out we have thirty eight people in being provided sweetwater under museums and marines that's where we put under i say i see that a different standard of a radha comment committee once yes thank you mister chair i am in the unique spot of owning fencers and a bowling centered that started nineteen fifty three not done in the owner of the bowling center for two years just to confirm the bowling centers are not in the same category of fitness of one person for five hundred square feet then was the question it's six people total in the entire facility that's one per cent a noble occupancy firesides are proxy ten percent of the occupancy right now and having both facilities fineable centers the bowling centers have to the pope one hundred percent mass one percent of the time and the distance is about fifteen feet with the bowling lanes between the people and governor ansley it right where it said everybody gathers to gareth and around seeing to goethe scores we have a lectric scoring and we keep people fifteen feet apart so the fitness industry is very safe bowling but had so much safer than that so just to get us into the one person for five hundred square feet when really help the bowling industry least parallel to the fitness industry astrologer much i appreciate his comments the levin or prisoner from shiryo have another common for them i see you bear i was just contention i'm not sure if this is applicable in all but i think for as to the fitness industry probably any other business that has been severely restricted is the criterion is so different from industry to industry like i was able to had to fly for work to recently and i was just sitting there as a business one and i am sitting with an inch of strangers for hours at a time in the plan he wallowed of the take the mass of and it can be so you try to say positive you know like worcester in the concentration i go to different businesses whether it's ichorous and of peoples department stores hundreds of people thousands of people that are going through it at such high value and no insanity in between and it antisonar when we are part of the solution in their soother industries that are allowed to operate it to give us a fair fighting chance to do what we do the thing very much for the ah the last were in your promise and cook  she's with featherston corporation and courage who anathematize and glad sorry as citoyenne inoculating instancing senators my name is anne cook i live in one antically my father started our family business over almost years ago now when he bought his first theatre in portages as where i grew up we expanded over here to wenatchee remained here we are now when accretions corporation which is doing business as some basin theaters we have two cinemas in one antanaclasis few days in november thunderbolts communities and also a few tourists being in both these areas we i heavily on the tourism industry a had me see in twenty twenty we operated until the march shut down not opening again until november and when at the we had six days of operations before we were shut down and importuned nine days it's a major rampant put an operation like this and get it back open again so it took some time and my family had the traveled accordance kept that one open and then come over back to when acetone sent a my heart very intensely family oriented business  the impact of being shot down or have been devastating on to our company to our family financially emotionally the whole thing  the impact of being shut down also was very difficult for our employees we were continually to provide our health care insurance to our key employees who were full timers and had opted into that just recently had to make the very difficult decision to discontinue because we're just out of money and we really want to be here when the light is back in theaters  going to be tough we need to be able to reopen and bring some revenue in you know when we opened in november we adopted the intimacy protocols which as it was developed a man barometer by one sarah no problem and so were we reopened for those few days in november we adopted our cinemas protocols which were developed by our national teeters association owner useto i should say they had an epidemiologist provide information on how we can do this safely protocols to put in place we did do that during those few short days that we were open you know is very encouraging that on the january fourteenth outbreak report from the department of health shows it since june first we we were not open at that point but since then there were zero reported outbreaks in movie theaters here in washington state we feel is a very safe environment for people to recreate in and we were very encouraged by our customers turning out in support when we were able to open and tell us how much they've missed the opportunity to be there the obviously they had protocol need to re open so that our customers and are employees can be in a safe environment get away from reality for an hour or two and i feel that's kind of something that we've all been missing in this whole pandemic and were love to be an opportunity for people to do that are concerned is like her from the others is sustainable and to brampton only to shut down again in a few weeks is was devastating again financially it was another hit we spent a lot of money getting the or pan moving in the right direction and i see a mount of sinai just now do you have a couple if you have another man if you have anything else to think  i just feel it's really important for all of our communities customers employees and just business owners as a whole that we begin operating again i feel that we can already proven that we can do it safely and i think if we all together then in a manner just i guess i can say i'm disheartened that if this goes on too much longer we're gone and these communities will have no movie contain no it's not an essential like maybe is or other kind of services but i think it's very important i think our communities have proven that they want us there we will not be able to withstand we've exhausted all of our resources luckily we had a rainy day fund as gotten this far but that's gone so it's it's just very hard breaking for us as a family and it would be difficult to face her employees in our customers and say that we're going for good i hope that doesn't come to the  thank you very much i really appreciate your comments sidewise as a question thank you mister chair and do you know i we know that there's forty seven states right now
