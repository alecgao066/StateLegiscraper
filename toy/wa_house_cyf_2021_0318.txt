children even families committee will come to order to day we have a hearing on house bill fifty two thirty seven and executive session on two bills were going to do the executive session first and those two bills are fifty one eighteen and fifty one twenty two there are moments too great so high would like to ask lotteries the moment for each legislation monometallist of those two bills of fifty one eighteen as the committee wrote will recall this bill relates to re entry subjects including  it facilities defining those as essential public facilities for purposes of siding and a few other things the amendment to that bill wickham five nine it specifies that the department of children in families instead of the department of commerce may not attempt to cite those new community facilities in eastern washington unless there is an equal or greater number of western washington site and make references to those community facilities consistent with other references use in that section i characterize these changes as technical changes you questions are not moment man and oportunity again therefore amendments to this as the bill relating to duport jurisdiction creating the ravage and goustie as force and modifying the age of capacity for children and the first of those amendments became five years seven and relates to the capacity part of the bill that age capacity and it modifies which a child is incapable of committing a crime to specify the children under age eleven softening younger instead of under age thirteen as the alcador are incapable of committing crime and children in these three ten who are charged with a serious vineshaded degree are presumed incapable but that presumption can be relied it also specifies that youth courts have authority over as a lever seventeen instead of thirteen seventeen and makes other changes that are consistent with those age specifications  the next amendment six  it restores current law related to the capacity for children so i removed the changes that the underlying film makes to that section and then modifies the task force that created in the bill and two to be renamed as the juvenile court jurisdiction task force and includes within that task forces duties the responsibility to provide recommendations related to the age of capacity and i presumed in capacity for children committing crime and makes changes to the intent language consistent with those changes the next amendment we come italians a number of  to the raised the age tungstic task force it requires that task force to in consideration research and case law regarding adolescent brain development and make recommendations regarding expansion of juvenal court jurisdiction to include ages above nineteen years of age it also requires that that task force port include anticipated county and state ility changes and modifications including a time line or planning need to successfully expand jurisdiction and then moving on to the final amendment we come five zero at that amendment expands the circumstances in which i had the presumption that children ages at three twelve are incapable of committing crime may be rebutted so the underlying bill says the that those people of those ages are presumed incapable but that can be rebutted only in circumstances where those children are charged with murder one or murder too and the amendment expands that to include a serious finances or rapin the second degree  thank you any questions for love in these moments i question if the order in the thereafter that the bill that the

of things that can help that more successful teachers represent proper thank you bearing tree section sub section see starting on line thirty five an talks about department attempt to take new community residential facilities east of the crest the cascade mountains of less tersely pomatum sided on the west side and stain my personal opinion rather have that working say that department can

interest to continue with our cartentierce thank you but i'm sure for longespee to it thank you reverend i do think that the originally the intense with this was a clarification of moment in the

people that when with the due pass retention are a moment represented him i wanamee has been moved and seconded and remarks presented on the room truehome concern for the bill in my experience a growing up on the streets but i i would like to think that all of us have some experience with regard to children at these ages but it seems wholly inappropriate to meantime sense in emanations respect i think that this is if we continue to ratchet which kids are not held accountable we are number one increasing the risk not notoriety or recognizing their competence the stand for these types of issues but were also increasing the opportunity to these kids to be manipulated by english he started around the age of ten and it is not beyond the reason of around the reason ability or common sense that kids are going to be recruited whether it was in the trail park or traversiere we saw he lifted parents rather round doing things of the neighborhood kids getting in the bothies for them a young impression will kids again we're talking about young the press will kids but were sitting up in environment not only that's going to hurt them that other people are going to propound take advantage of them but on the streets with gains this is going to be a gangrene allow for these children not to be held accountable in up to the age of thirteen and so i am trying to lower the age here make a note to to our staff that if we don't take it now i love to actually leronde the age of ten that was my intent i run the i read the bill on withdrawing it rightly proposed it but i think if we're going to try to protect our kids i believe the sponsors are magnanimity to do the bill then we need amendments like this to protect not only does the lower the age but also brings up other crimes i can tell you i will say that i speak for my for my next minute but i really do believe that we need to lower these ages here not only for the sake of the kids and recognized the fact that they do have cognition of right and wrong but also to protect them from illicit adult behavior that would seek to take advantage of the thank you rosieres native wit in you made chair and respectfully requesting a novel on this and then manless this before in terms of incarceration especially as it relates to juvenile justice but to really help offenders in our communities we need to focus on the person who cannot be crime and this could not be more important or talking about youth with brains that are just not fully developed until well into their mid twenties and we were looking at these children at this stage we would see that they are all traumatized children and not the overlap of the child welfare system and in those ages scores is really evident in the situations and in clinical terms on wardress ing this behavior where we're talking about reactionary react behavior in kinshasa acting out and the criminal justice and doesn't do anything to treat these behaviours that we're seeing in our children so we're not saying that these are not very concerning behavioral with right away we know that but we need to help these children rehabilitate to live there a full life after this happening without continuing down a road or down the life of offending and recess while i appreciate the attempt intent of this amendment i don't think that this is the manorbere we want to be recommending  thank you reexamination remarks and and i just want to relate what the upsetting said with this member i think it's a good amendment i think it's  at randalls understand my molesting this is a good amendment to support i think i surrager we need the owner kids certain amount of accountability and in their actions so white with the would ask for yes thank you thank you reinterpret and and i want to sing representative young vercherin your liveries in our consideration of this antient i also respectfully request a new on this amendment i think you were an excellent point i represented a young that often these young people who we find in these sorts of behaviours are coerced by adults section the coercion of those adults and the accountability on those adults when we should be putting our emphasis not on young people who we know are susceptible because of that bland development i would like to see an increase of us also addressing some of what you extend to be in person at onny young person to experience but you experience certainly in it something that is important for my district that what we need to do is address the true folks who are causing these sorts of behavior and not hold you accountable for adults that behavior and kept you are holmencollen thank you in our juvenile facilities are designed to rehabilitate these these youths had if there if they're not doing that than we we really need to address to that and i think just a year is as a public school teacher i've i've seen kindergarteners know very well and in it could actually be held accountable on day certainly not doing these kinds of crimes but but you know doing wrong and they knew very well when when gently confronted and so i think this is a good man a higher its passing one about charities of the moment is a difference between the cantabili of by and children of this young age really did not understand the consequences of their actions nor what i argue for stand right from wrong particularly when they are subject to negative her influences and where they are only gazed in short term thinking no impulse control and the accountability that we seek epoch so apparent rather than a punitive approach which the record is clearly shown that has only made it worse for these young children whose brains then harden they the wiring of the brain when they are punished into the fire light response and ruins the rest of their lives we need to wrap around these children irrespective of behave the mohave in arloes and so the months he allows them to much more successful as you good man thank you for rescuing marches well didn't we do not sit amarita those in favour of winnie's please indicate by saying your name and i the possessing about names name and day represented a moment is not carried and madame additional moments represent by most ex represented over madeleine with them by the six has been moved and seconded remarks replied i referred to my notes and a white scandalous cause it used to be which five or six hours with them five sick but that besides the one to flaunt the elverston there is restored to the age at which children are incapable or embrasure capable of committing crime seeing a name of the task force to the deprecatory jurisdiction task force from the the title of the giver's raised the age juvenile justice force and the third bull appoint is modified intimating to consider amending the jurisdiction of general carter section to include us youth age thirteen to nineteen retirement simply amended so coomassie that comanche i handled a dish as the scores and law enforcement is when i came across these cases i worked together with my prosecuted attorney's office we established actually they helped me establish him as the attorneys in the prosecutors of who wrote it and it was a series of ten questions for these juveniles establish course after reading the memoranda writes in having a counsellor of prince border in the room with them or even apparent these questions did you understand what you are doing with wrong whoever told you before at what you were doing was wrong and some go through these ten questions that would be a part of my entire police report so that the prosecutor's office could make a decision if it that this child understood if they knew what they were doing was right so to rate simply raise the age cart blanche i think his way way way too far on this currently a law enforcement officers are working with their prosecuting attorneys are working with their school counsellors and their teachers in their principles in the best interest of the children and an entire school student body so i think that this is a good amendment i think it's what's best for our schools entire public safety of our children's like committing a moment you he remembered as respectfully for no boat on this amendment the original bill did have the old rage coming online but that was immediately but that was changed to a task force on the younger and which this would also class into a task force i believe we have the information on grandement and an available other options for the youth that adolphine to study that any further and so on going to ask for a novel and the additional remarks see man always in favour of wickfield ornate and i repeat all those polished the moment the name and a and endearment carried there are additional amendments i moved with one five o five so this amendment does a few things it  charters the castors to consider facility issues when they are looking at issues beyond the current seventeen year old and i make some changes in that membership of that group to make sure it's more averse bulking in considering those issues and and that given current case law recent case law and what we know about reinvent and encourages that passport to look at all of that as well as their considering as on disagree or nineteen but possibly above that especially given the monkey decision that talked about bridemen and in twenty or laswell it sounds as represented that so i do appreciate your intent here when i have again i'm concerned that it is said stretching herself to two older and orchid not to be held accountable for what they do i'm very concerned and you know what i have to draw but meetings that we get away in his companions my life's experience and instrumentality don't understand and what they don't know how to handle this in the visitation this moment i'm just concerned that we're just going to go a little bit too far were going to include sansonnetto far out there for me i mean in that age there children are rebeccaites when their eighteen and the other allowed to vote the longevity and they conferred and they can do things and i think at decided when we are as as a society and we need to be teachers of accountability and we could teach that one there finishers old and is not that by doing that were disconcertingly you to remark seeing man all that was in favour of wickenden representatives apotheoses or penmen the daynecourt wildeve is not an disagreements represented in by way animalitas been bonneton and remarks represent young latour also very concerned  with regard to the types of pertinacity are incapable of committing a crime but we're going to allow for it for first and second degree murder come there a number of other crimes that i believe we should be included in this kid's millet their doing here and they should know and even i believe the flea the metrical unseared with a number of the counter points that are being made on some of the issues but please hear me on this and there are a number of logical traps here that were planked or going to be i believe are going to be exploited to to hurt these kids if we don't at least put into law some actions whether you believe or not that the child is capable of knowing right and wrong in these areas it we don't put some in law some actions are beyond reproach in your going to be held accountable for them even if you haven't returned fully you still need to recognize that baseplate you don't go i believe some of those cape of other people  i can tell you at the age in elementary school third grade second grade run around the streets with other street gang kids the topics of fakenham a girl pulling down her panting trying to get inside oaths were all things are recognised among the kids might age one in the ether at the play ground or in the local park across the street and every one of the kids are these top in these turrets circles knew that such was wrong he still pursued the things he thought that some young girl were some young boy be red by a little bit older young girl or boy is a real fear that i have for my kids i have all your kids and in a constituent kids and the same that we would we would a class and says it's a child is capable of doing such a heinous act and doesn't know that such a thing would be right or wrong that forcefully yourself unto another person is wrong that they lack me building in the think that's a brigadier we all know this this is something that we have to stand up for fares if there certain acts that everybody knows that we we have a different spectrum that's materializing here that says well maybe they may they they fully have cognition made their brains still developing what i would spit out there is a bridge too far even on that category and that's why i'm trying to draw the line here with stand that for kids and and write some of these crimes and give prosecutors not between to go after them i can't imagine being apparent to find out his child is grave and six the thing try to get some redress for that crime only to find out that the other child that rate might kid was never ethel responsible has no possibility of being held responsible and because they enforceable knowing that what they were doing to my child with one please illusions thank you representation to respect her as bornemissa even and i do want to make it really clear to that that i believe that we are going to be holding these kids accountable to stop through the criminal justice system which we know is not an evidence faced rehabilitation system and so the how is through the april health services like capabilities treatment reverences a family reconciliation of this is a homestead there still civil court actions like dependency position conditions at riskiness petitions so by no means are we seeing that these children just will go along their way but like frisonnette men which is something done consideration with their with their family with their parents to take responsibility for their youth that they can be involuntarily committed up until the age of thirteen and that already base in there given the unsure that family does have a role in that and that is an important rule for them to have and so again urging a note again not to say that these kids don't mean help but that is exactly what we're saying is that these is his children need our help not our punishment but are revelation are services are understanding of the tamahay have been through the misguidance been through and making sure that they are they are raised not in prison but in a community that is wrapping around them the heathen raffaelite i remarks for present of death humans i was involved in canework shop a retreating on five years ago i guess and i see went to florida you know dot with a monotheist different ones of satan our lives and was i really eating about never thought about it my entire life and and it was around it was related and the damage i saw to some of the young women and even the older women who were a part of our guiteau twenty five or thirty of us was it just tormented no idea i never give thought and nobody ever taught me about this but had no idea panthemont opinion the training effects of something and abbondante twenty thirty years previous was just devastating to me and i i felt i felt some empathy for for some of these ladies had been suffered to the end i think okay i just can't imagine letting anybody came on something that is serious to cause as much damage to these people  you know i was stunned of us i obliterates i ever had that i'm not sure that was so that i was really supposed to be at that retreat but i was in and i learned so much from the italian thing and i've learned as i eyed always had a lottery spect for women i swam that regard as fontenette see what has happened as soon different people and at even the saloon men it would been rated to the boys and and i have a friend to day that was absent so challenges with being rattail and his son is seventy five years old he still suffers what happened in labassandre years old and i just don't think i think the rapiers serious offense and i think that would be need to be elegant knows not right it's not what society views as some acceptable behavior now then a lot of overdone canteenair on our children we can we can give them direction we can help them understand and we don't have to beat the tar out of those kind of things we don't have to lock him up for a couple of years but i think they need to know that there's there is a consequence and there is accountability in the wildwood those   lawyers like to take over opossums to be frozen if i was wondering if it was just to my importing that recalling it if you could go ahead and speak a reflex he utragan sire pecially request on the bengalis is about the person and not the crime in the many young people are from these communities there the riving generational trauma clinical poverty over policeman and fortunate incarceration and you know again there are many different worlds ternate responses  and replying we can do more to upper these you that argument the courtesan get them on the right path alternatives that don't involve incarceration or drive youth caper into the problematic behavior that it might be seen for talking about this and certain allied off a lot of those different things that we are to support our children but no we can provide family reconciliation services regional services like those money who we heard from the other day sitooation have been really amusing results in their work and with love and as a lovable that you know a we have fully formed brain its arsoli to support our youth and fine thoughtful and effective way to help them recover and not to just pretend that this behaviour goes away by by calling them in a dull and throwing them behind bars and entreating me not labeled to have meaningful allusions to solve problems and help them be successful again in recommending a no longer think you rule speak to mine thank you we the haste then i think that we're forgetting about the victims here so to make sure that that these kids that are that performed the crime seems to me that we need to make sure that it is that you that they have mental health valuation and i don't see that in this bill too for first or i think that it's really important that we vote yes on this amendment but up i think that we are missing some piece i thank you relegating to the memory of the itinerant missing something in the context of this i understand that the debate that we're having a following her closely i understand the points are being made but this amendment is is not singing arguing against the premise of the bill this is simply saying that we're going to allow prosecutors for children from the ages of a through twelve that if the prosecutor finds that the crime was so heinous an there's a possibility of at least pursuing something the mechanism of the underlying bill with the amendment would still be in place with regard to the arguments that we've made or that have been made against the amendment alooking is that in addition to what we said for first and second degree of murder were also adding a few other ones that are equally bad it doesn't change the default standing of the villainy says it gives a prosecutor's opportunity to say the okaw it come on we know what this is going to be with with all due respect we know what the sign to be these are going to be the most famous cronies that these kids are committed if we want to offer them before the cure spectrum of offerings they give that option back to the prosecutors to go look at the say now you know what one we're going to argue that the presumption needs to be removed away then yes they knew what they were doing i guess we're going to go after the one it's not going to be every one a default assumption still stays in place and i just wanted to call out that clarification because i think it's i think it's so important here i don't know i have the bellerophon over the years of being a firebrand of a number of things i'm trying my best to change that for the sake of assuming the good of all intent on that's going on here but this one is really thrown me for a loop i just this this is an obvious one i mean we can think of some of the situations of the current streets where the most famous of acts are committed on other people by young by young people and that in this case let an i got to the first thing i told my mom and i turned ten years old he now endeared to her said man i am now a decade years old a decade old i'm now ready to take on more of a manly leadership olinthus house because we didn't have a bad that's it told my mamma did my brain however the cur immature or developed or under it was time said that to my mom at the age of seven years old i was getting my younger brother up and walking the elementary school to my mom is already working on the job kids can get these things and this isn't changing the other line the fault assumption of the bill which i i still disagree with amaranthe but this is just giving a different actions it can be overcome if a prosecutor wants to do it that's the new one of this amendment i really please consider the indirect and the spartan youth you marianne i see that carson has rejoined us we just had by the comment on this amendment carson and we were going to suspend the boat on this to move to testimony but i defer to you now that you were able to return thank you thank you very much madam my chair sorry about that lovely technical issues there my hand i okay so all those in favor of the animation and i botheration and a representation by the list adopted representative peristaltick you carson i move that the adopted amendments be corporate into striking amendment in engrosses senate bill one twenty two to erected out of committee with a due pass as amended recommendation thank you it has been moved in sectarists and bill if you are twenty two be moved out of committee as a mandatory remarks i would just say that this is an important bill to provide understanding of grandement and his still provide services to you to make sure that they are being raised with the services he had the need and being held accountable versus copaic in english a great life a gentleman good man and i think that is pretty critical so i'm going to her for your support additional remarks are presented the here so i said earlier you know what i can draw on the pilfering so my desk brother he had a and there's three men in our family and we go up somewhat together you know to our lives and to my dad's ruminate let those kids pretty much to the free rein they were held accountable they were any fences have boundaries so  that very very difficult life they've never been able really challenges sanusian instinct focused on anything in it said and we've talked about you know i've talked about it with my two cousins one of which the one whether because of the lack of boundaries or lack of discipline or life and she but they took the wise knockabout when we were younger and they said they you know they would get they would really dissolutely to big fists get some direction from their parents because they felt like they were loved because they could do whatever they wanted to do and he was the look at them you know myself and my two sisters and we seemed to have some crusoe direction and some gold and channels of life and they be they resented that if they didn't have that we have in the tahiti can understand where they were gone from him and that's my concern here is an we're not trying to make hard and grapes out of anybody who were trying to give him some directions that were trying to be trying to   each consequences in teach right from wrong so you know her world with the arm are nicknames lawmakers and so we make laws that we expect people to follow yet there were going to extend it out where they don't have to follow but you know and and bring developments in interesting it's an interesting concept but know where we were eight years old or entire bodies are completely developed and they continue to develop as we achanna i got a pretty good idea right wrong with it was six by the time i was to have a solid what things were right wrong and and it wasn't it was but you know parents in time with me and told me to stop as well as other people you know wasn't just my parents then we learned these things and i think it but cotton thing that really kept me from doing things because in all of us gives us a remonstratively you know we were at ten years old i was a latecomer ation about their long things that were inappropriate manieres animation know what girls do in postal about loathing that is in appropriate comether their age we talked about this stuff but we also knew that we didn't act on it we knew there were consequences in again then i think that important thing at another i was sad i thought the pergamena just to torment my intention i thought i never want to go there i don't want you that i'm going to town i hear and do what's right in missus anathemas at a pretty young age he had done you know i'm not tell you what right now i still don't want to go to sea with us i don't think they're premonition i think about what's right initiates we all mean that disappointed that direction of those to signboards in our lives and the animated he if we let him off and they don't have any direction sideache not going to they're going to lose that potentate is not going to be there for in their lives and i think that we mountaineering teaching the different baritone but also knowing of their consequences because in life there are consequences it is something that may be leatheswater they are there to merionethshire and now underside so thank you venture tenement reprisal and then they do antionette do have a lot of people question the custodian for present tersely thank you carson i will keep my comment short cause i also want to hear from our neighbors beylick i just wanted to encourage a yes vote as well on this bill i think the senator for posing the bill for a consideration of something that we've known for a long time in washington i need to consider which is the evolution what we understand from science and best practice about what young people need when they make mistakes nothing about this bill says that they will not be held responsible for consequences but what it does say is that in circulating them we know is not the solution that will actually put them on the right path to not be deeper in our incarceration and jail systems and provides a not i know i'm not alone in this but the youth that are so often in these cycles have trauma poverty and often a melon and level the custom in harm's way for black bandages youth amorous being able to double down on our investment in the system that can keep them from even having these choice points for making these mistakes in the first place is a good investment in these young people at our unities and that is the direction that this bill that is asked for young people all young people being treated with care and how can we addressed these issues in a way that make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else for again so that seems very important to me and my neighbors and i porcupine thank you represent ever  i appreciate about being able to work with all of you might sell legislators or sometimes we get to agree are comment made to day in gender debate in me one of the commencement was going to jubilation rooms their lives there is a gentleman young man who i had to arrest sinfonies charge went to fourteen months in a juvenile detention facility operated by the state of washington and the first day that person came back to school came directly to me his gory sore soberest in officer and said i learned my lesson i change my life will you help me in another example is that the desert ruins lives as i was on the floor of the house representatives when in the chemicals parental me in my cell phone and said i repeopled adopted son in one of our cars in your drive way is going to about the community committing crimes and there contacted jupiter said they don't have a bed for that as i hang on a second and called juvenile him in a whole hinterfere hours i cecille do and then my wife will come and pick him up as it will do that for you represented etiquette did that get what my son never committed one of those crimes again he learned lesson and then lastly about brain science i got called to a house one time where a nine year old in year old was running a home that had credulite home and a seven year old brother was very obedient and with the parents told him to do but the nine year old was running the household i made a game playing with that family using the tools available to me as the laforce an officer before i left that house without having to make an arrest but using the tools of leadership that young man took down the barricade to his bedroom in up his bedroom and all was well i never had to go back to that house again so you know i don't think it's just a brain science thing i think it's a character as you and i taking kids who do not attention oftentimes it does not ruin their lives they learn their lessons so ill be voting not to day  marthe only other point of latimer and the sacred gravity and locate the points of man out amendments i think they stand under an mareuil know them that you represent a good man brought up the hardened in him that regenerate brought of the science and is one of making not about the science whether i disagree with it or not the entire argument about the science is only being discussed from the preside the argument is being made what we want to leverage whatever scientific data that we're looking at here that we believe is conclusive because we want to use it to the benefits i would submit to you that it's not just quotquot the good guys that are to use this science the people in the street we are with this type of legislation were mere saniassi for a child under the age of thirteen to commit a crime and by the way if you can't commit a crime and you're not committing their porcine what are the consequences but not committing a crime there and that's my point is of the illicit side of our society will use this as justification the same scientific studies at their hand with the same type of reasoning that the good guys would want to use the science the same while we don't want to punish you we want to you know

and to bring this bill forward to you i know it is familiar and lena thank you so much for the job you did on really covering the differences and i understand there's a chart so i will leave it to your own eyes to kind of see what the differences are but i do want a really just highlight again the four areas that this bill addresses that repentin working on that just this session but throughout my three sessions in the senate and its surround the stabilization and expansion of the industry of trace making child care more affordable making child care in early learning more accessible and strengthening prevention and intervention services and i really do want to call out a really to differences in the bill and one of those things is really a rate late to the licensing system that we've heard about from herbiers all across the state and i will say the early start at which you have probably are very familiar with that was a precursor this first start for kids act really focused on quality and what the fair start for kids act does is really turned its attention not only on quality but really on access as well and we know we had issues prior to the pandemic and now we have them even more so so the systems work in the system alignment and so that is why the licensing subcommittee piece was added and i was very happy to include that as an amendment that came from the floor of the other piece of this is because of the pandemic many individuals have realized that school was the care setting for many children and that since we've had the pandemic and online distance learning in hybrid learning what we realize is that we have to understand where children are when they're not in a classroom and not in school so we also called up and called out and really lifted the supports for thevenet in program serving birth through twelve and those kinds of things would be expanded learning mentorship school age child care wrapped services supports and all those things altaforte years this has been my career working in early caracoling to create a quality and accessible system of care for all families regardless of where they are across the state and it has been the work i've done as i continued to be in the senate of this bill is a combination of hundreds of hours of work that repentance together with stakeholders that represent many who you'll hear a fantod this is a
