    "StateLegiscraper is a Python package that scrapes and processes data from U.S. state legislature websites. As of writing, the package is focused on transcribing standing committee hearings from each state legislature from its native archival format to text, so that this text data can be easily used for NLP research purposes and for public review. For more details about the StateLegiscraper, please visit its [Github repository](https://github.com/ka-chang/StateLegiscraper) where it is under active development. "
