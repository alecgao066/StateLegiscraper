(BDR 40-20) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN DINA NEAL (Assembly District No. 7): \nI  am  here  today  to  present  A.B. 254  for  your  consideration,  which  is  a \ncomprehensive bill on sickle cell disease. In Nevada, and I believe nationally, \nsickle cell has been a disease that has not necessarily been on the high list of \nattention. It has also not been on the list in terms of prescriptions, ensuring \nthese particular patients find advancement in treatment and become a priority.  \n \nMany people do not know what sickle cell disease is. Sickle cell trait is an \ninherited  condition  affecting  the  hemoglobin  in  the  red  blood  cells  and  is \nconsidered to be mild. However, hemoglobin is the iron-containing protein which \ntransports oxygen in the red blood cells to the rest of the body. The sickle cell \ntrait is considered to be a carrier state, meaning an individual can never develop \nthe sickle cell disease, but can have children who will develop the trait.  \n \nSickle cell is a blood cell condition where an individual inherits two abnormal \nhemoglobin genes. The mutation in this gene results in abnormal hemoglobin \nprotein leading to the distortion of the red blood cells from a round shape to a \ncrescent or sickle shape. This sickle cell shape moves through the blood causing \nanemia  and  obstructing  the  blood  vessels,  leading  to  recurring  episodes  of \nsevere pain and multiple organ damage.  \n \nI am attempting to get an understanding on why this particular population, as \nsmall as it is in Nevada, is being affected and why I am bringing a bill to deal \nwith the comprehensive care and study of these patients.  \n \nIn Nevada, the majority of sickle cell patients are on Medicaid. According to the \ntables from the Office of Analytics with the Department of Health and Human \nServices  (DHHS)  (Exhibit  E  and  Exhibit  F),  the  total  number  of  patients \ndiagnosed with sickle cell disorder in 2016 and 2017 was about 1,211 patients. \nThis is a very small population, but a population that has a great need for \nconsistent care. When these patients go to the hospital, their disease is not \nbeing appropriately treated. Although they come in with pain issues, on the \nsurface they do not appear to be having a pain management episode when, in \nfact, they are having a severe pain management episode requiring assistance \nand medication. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2019 \nPage 5 \n \nThis bill is an attempt to remedy some of the issues I learned about over the \nInterim, and a representation of the conversations I had during that time. There \nis a Pacific Sickle Cell Regional Collaborative of nine or ten sickle cell states in \nthe west that includes Nevada, Oregon and California. During the Interim, I had \na  chance  to  meet  with  several  patients,  as  well  as  Sheila  James  with  the \nU.S. Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services.  She  spoke  about  how  the \nfederal government is now making this a priority in an attempt to move the \nneedle around regional care and planning for sickle cell patients. \n \nAssembly Bill 254 section 4.5 gives the definition of sickle cell disease. \n \nSection 6 of the bill would \"establish and maintain a system for the reporting of \ninformation on sickle cell disease and its variants\". This would be similar to the \nNevada Central Cancer Registry by creating a sickle cell registry. The reason for \nthe mention of variants is that there can be other traits that are a spin-off, and \nother diseases which manifest from sickle cell disease.  \n \nSection 7 lays out the form and manner in which information should be included \nin the database, such as the name, address, age and ethnicity of the patient.  \n \nSection 8 states the records of the health care facility for each case shall be \nmade available to the Chief Medical Officer and that the Division of Public and \nBehavioral  Health  (DPBH)  of  the  DHHS  will  abstract  the  information  to  be \ncompiled from the records of a health care facility. \n \nSection 9 states the information compiled must be published. \n \nSection 10 states the Chief Medical Officer or qualified person shall do analysis \non the information. Section 10.5 allows the DPBH to apply for any grants, \ndonations or gifts. This is due to a federal bill which passed out of Congress in \nDecember 2018, which allowed surveillance projects and states' participation in \nfederal grants around sickle cell disease. \n \nThe  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  (CDC)  has  been  running  a \nsurveillance  project  in  California  and  Georgia.  There  is  potential  for  that  to \nexpand into other states to take a proactive approach to sickle cell disease. \n \nSection  11  of  the  bill  deals  with  the  privacy  and  confidentiality  of  the \ninformation collected. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2019 \nPage 6 \n \nSection 12 states a person or governmental entity providing information to the \nDPBH must not be held liable in a civil or criminal action for sharing confidential \ninformation unless done in bad faith.  \n \nSection 13 states the DPBH may adopt regulations around the variants of sickle \ncell traits and requires them, when necessary, to determine the presence of \ncertain preventable diseases. This section is important for the parent to gain \nunderstanding of the disease, and help in the process and treatment of the \ndisease. \n \nWe have been performing sickle cell testing on patients in Nevada since the \nearly 1990s; however, what does not happen is the testing of the parents of a \nchild with sickle cell. Typically, the parent is left with trying to figure out where \ntheir child got the sickle cell trait. This led to conversations around ensuring the \nparent is also tested should the parent choose to do so.  \n \nSection 13.5 lays out the services required of a laboratory, which ties into the \nscreening of the parent. \n \nSection 18.2 is the portion of the bill stating \"The Director shall include in the \nState Plan for Medicaid a requirement that the State pay the nonfederal share of \nexpenditures\".  I  have  spoken  with  the  DHHS  and,  as  it  is  such  a  small \npopulation, they felt they could absorb the cost.  \n \nThis section also discusses case management services for a participant under \nthe age of 18 covered by Medicaid who has been diagnosed with sickle cell. \nThese services were not being followed. A child could have pediatric care at the \n\"one\" service actually caring for sickle cell patients in southern Nevada. Within \ntheir  case  management,  there  is  no  follow  through  with  pain  episodes, \nprescriptions or when they transition from pediatric to adult care. This provision \nis attempting to focus on case management, visits to specialists, treatment for \nmental illness and education as needed. It was important for myself and the \ngroup to ensure all the variants of the disease were centered on evaluation, \ncounseling and education involved in case management. \n \nA patient is more in a position to know about their disease versus the provider \ntaking care of them. There is an idea to fill in the gap ensuring the providers, \nhospitals and anyone who encounters these patients, become more aware of \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2019 \nPage 7 \n \nthe health plan following the patient; that there are services that should be \nprovided when needed.  \n \nSection 18 also includes that in the State Plan for Medicaid, the Director shall \ninclude a requirement that the State pay the nonfederal share of expenditures \nfor at least two visits per clinical year, and unlimited refills for each prescription \ndrug  for  the  treatment  of  the  disease.  The  reason  for  this  is  because  the \npatients were finding themselves in pain management episodes being treated as \na person abusing opioids or other prescription drugs. This was mainly happening \ndue to the lack of knowledge in the hospital emergency room, and patients were \nbeing misdiagnosed. Physicians need to be able to manage patient refills in a \nway that allows them to reduce emergency periods, be eligible to prescribe \nmedications  and  take  care  of  patient  pain  episodes  as  needed.  There  is  no \ndetermining  when  you  will  have  a  pain  episode;  you  cannot  say  every \nsix months or even every two weeks.  \n \nDr. Abdul-Rashid, whose primary basis is caring for sickle cell patients in the \npediatric realm, has said a child with sickle cell would need extra supplements \nnot covered by Medicaid. I emailed Medicaid in an attempt to find out how to \nget PediaSure covered. Because these patients are on Medicaid, and part of the \nlow-income families, they sometimes find themselves without the money for \nPediaSure,  but  possibly  the  money  for  the  prescriptions  they  require. \nSection 18.5 is providing for a list of nonprescription supplements to be covered \nby Medicaid. \n \nSection 18.4 ensures sickle cell and its variants has the meaning as described in \nsection  4.5  of  the  bill.  We  are  attempting  to  ensure  the  Pharmacy  and \nTherapeutics  Committee  could  internally  review  what  supplements  and \nprescriptions are needed for these patients to determine going forward what is \nnecessary for these patients.  \n \nSection 18.8, subsection 4 is to ensure, within the formulary for Medicaid, \nthere is a list of prescription drugs to be determined essential for treating sickle \ncell disease and its variants. There are drugs from pharmaceutical companies \nthat patients may be eligible for, other than hydroxyurea that may potentially \ncome  into  the  market  in  2021-2022.  We  know  that  since  the  federal \ngovernment has begun to move in the sickle cell space, there has been more \ninterest by the pharmaceutical companies to produce a new drug other than \nhydroxyurea, and progress beyond this drug. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2019 \nPage 8 \n \nAnecdotally,  I  have  heard  sickle  cell  patients  are  more  than  likely  the  only \ndisease group that has been without actual movement toward advancement in \nmedical care in the last 10 to 20 years. This bill will help to correct that. \n \nSection 18.9 deals with how prescriptions for controlled substances such as \nopioids should be handled. \n \nSections 19 through 29 speak to the issuance of health care policies covered \nunder  Nevada  Revised  Statutes  (NRS)  689A,  689A.330,  689B,  689C, \n689C.425,  695A,  695B,  695C,  695C.050,  695C.330  and  695G  related  to \nindividual health plans for patients under 18 years of age diagnosed with sickle \ncell  and  its  variants.  These  sections  will  ensure  they  have  the  same  case \nmanagement services and medically necessary services provided during at least \ntwo visits per year and coverage for prescription drugs. \n \nIt is also important that we have a care model for patients transitioning from \npediatric care to adult care when the patient reaches 18 years of age. There is \ncurrently no transition of care and when the patient reaches 18 they are without \na provider. The patient would continue with their pediatric provider who would \ntake on the task of finding the patient a new provider.  \n \nI ascertained the individual health plans that are not Medicaid plans have almost \nzero to one patients that have sickle cell disease. I have guests in Las Vegas \nthat I am sure can testify to the numbers. The majority of the patients are \nMedicaid patients and do not fall under the private insurers, or there is a very \nsmall number who are now receiving case management services.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThis is a wonderful bill. If we give nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as \nAdvil and Aleve to a patient who is in sickle cell crisis, it will damage their \nkidneys  causing  acute  renal  failure  and  death  will  happen,  which  is \nunacceptable. I am heartened to hear your reference to opioids as this is the \ndrug of choice and the one they must have for their pain.  \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nAre  there  protocols  to  ensure  there  is  cybersecurity  for  the  database? \nSomething happening more often than not is the health care industry is being \ntargeted for security breaches.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2019 \nPage 9 \n \nI currently have S.B. 470 relating to cultural competency which may be related \nto what you spoke to in reference to the first sections of the bill, ensuring \npeople are able to accurately make a diagnosis. \n \nSENATE BILL 470: Revises provisions relating to health care. (BDR 40-785) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN NEAL:  \nThe  only  provisions  dealing  with  privacy,  confidentiality  or  liability,  are \nsections 11 and 12 of the bill. There are provisions for consent and being held \ncivilly and criminally liable for sharing confidential information. We did not deal \nwith whether or not information was going to be leaked or taken from the \nsystem. I thought that if other provisions intersect and applied to Medicaid, it \nwould all roll over.  \n \nEducation is a huge factor related to this bill and why it is inserted into the bill. \nThere  is  a  lack  of  education  just  in  terms  of  the  disease.  Having  a \ncomprehensive discussion about case management with the health management \norganizations and providers forces the conversation around case management, \nwhich is the conversation between the patient and the physician.  \n \nCurrently,  in  southern  Nevada,  one  provider  Dr.  Abdul-Rashid,  is  being  the \nadvocate for each one of her patients, ensuring she follows up with her patients \nhaving  these  conversations.  Anthem  came  to  the  table  and  was  able  to \nimplement a number of the items referenced in this bill. There was a question of \nhow  they  could  do  it  without  the  financial  cost.  We  discovered  having  the \nconversation with providers to explain the barriers for the patient, and how and \nwhen they were being lost in the system, helped them to internally change the \nmanner in which they serve the sickle cell patient.  \n \nThe medically necessary language that the firefighters asked for was added \nfrom the Assembly side. They currently have employees with sickle cell disease \nwho are being treated with step therapy. They wanted to ensure they could \ncontinue their step therapy within their existing plan of care. I adopted that \namendment to meet the needs of what patients felt they needed to navigate the \nconversation around the needs of the sickle cell patient. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2019 \nPage 10 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe  health  information  exchange,  or  database  of  information,  will  be  very \nhelpful  to  identify  those  diagnosed  with  sickle  cell  so  information  will  be \naccessible through medical records. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN NEAL: \nI have guests in Las Vegas who were a part of the conversations about this bill. \nWe met several times regarding the amendments and ensuring this bill met their \nneeds. \n \nNIK F. ABDUL-RASHID, M.D. (Director, Sickle Cell Disease Program; Cure 4 The \nKids Foundation) \nFor  the  record,  I  would  like  to  state  that  the  managed  care  company \nAssemblywoman Neal mentioned earlier was actually UnitedHealthcare rather \nthan Anthem. \n \nI  have  been  working  closely  on  this  bill  with  Assemblywoman  Neal.  I  fully \nsupport A.B. 254 as I deal with these patients and their families on a daily basis \nand have been fighting to ensure they receive the care they need. This care \nincludes receiving the correct medication they are unable to get because of \ncoverage or having the medication compounded for younger patients. It will also \nensure all patients from birth to adulthood receive the care they require in the \nclinics and the hospitals. We are hoping with good managed care for these \npatients, we can continue to make sure they stay healthy and live a long life. \n \nGINA GLASS (Executive Director, Dreamsickle Kids Foundation): \nI am the mother of a four-year-old with sickle cell disease. I am also the founder \nof the first sickle cell organization in Nevada. I am in support of A.B. 254. I met \nAssemblywoman Dina Neal last year and have been a great supporter of all \nthings sickle cell since then.  \n \nAssembly Bill 254 would mandate the collection of data and screening for all \nvariations of sickle cell disease and the sickle cell trait. It would also mandate \nMedicaid  provide  coverage  for  medications  regardless  of  composition  and \ncomprehensive care that people with sickle cell disease require. \n \nThe absence of legislation requiring the tracking and screening of sickle cell \ndisease in Nevada has led to substandard care for those with sickle cell disease. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2019 \nPage 11 \n \nIt has recently led to the death of a mother and wife who had the disease and \nwas improperly treated at a Las Vegas hospital. \n \nStates that lack protection for people who suffer from this rare disease leave \nroom for unnecessary deaths and malpractice. The last data collected on the \nsickle cell population in Nevada was in 2007 from the CDC. \n \nThis  bill  is  important  because  it  addresses  the  compounding  of  medication. \nHydroxyurea is currently only available in capsule form. My daughter can only \ntake medication in a liquid form. Right now, insurance applies an additional \ncharge to have the medication liquefied. Since I am not a medical professional, \nI do not feel comfortable sprinkling a capsule over her food or into a drink for \nher.  Consequently,  she  does  not  take  this  medication  which  could  help  her \nbetter manage her disease and lead to a better life for her.  \n \nWhen  we  moved  from  California,  it  became  evident  there  was  a  lack  of \nawareness in the community and in the medical field when it came to sickle cell \ndisease. I worked for a large company who stated they had never heard of the \ndisease. I was their first employee dealing with sickle cell disease. When my \ndaughter got ill and I would have to take time off from work, it was not looked \nat  as  compassionately  as  someone  with  cancer  or  other  issues  and  I  was \nterminated for missing time away from my job. When you see my daughter, she \ndoes not look sick, which is common with those dealing with sickle cell. They \noften do not look as ill as what is affecting them internally as it is not visible on \nthe outside.  \n \nThis bill would help address some of the barriers those with sickle cell disease \nexperience. It is not just the person with sickle cell; it is their families and loved \nones that are also affected by the disease. \n \nThis year, there is an opportunity for Nevada to make changes to address the \nmisfortune that has fallen upon people with sickle cell disease. There is still a \nneed for disparities that people with sickle cell disease face to be addressed \nlocally. \n \nI firmly believe, as a citizen of Nevada and an advocate for all impacted by \nsickle cell disease, that A.B. 254 is the foundation needed to ensure the needs \nof minorities with a rare disease such as sickle cell are accounted for in Nevada. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2019 \nPage 12 \n \nPAM WHITE (Adult Sickle Cell Foundation, Inc.): \nI am the founder of the Adult Sickle Cell Foundation, Inc. and the mother of \ntwo children with sickle cell disease; one is 19 and the other is 40 years old. \n \nAssembly Bill 254 will be beneficial and supportive to the sickle cell population \nas a whole. There are many good points to the bill, such as newborn screening, \nsurveillance, confidential collection of data and nonprescription supplements, as \nwell as the case management that is needed.  \n \nThis is a debilitating disease that can affect the heart, the liver and kidneys, and \ncan also cause strokes. Even though there might be a small population in Las \nVegas, there are over 100,000 people who deal with sickle cell disease.  \n \nDEONNTE COVINGTON: \nMy  sister  Ms.  Glass  spoke  previously.  I  moved  here  from  Los  Angeles, \nCalifornia. My niece is four years old and has sickle cell disease. It is not easy to \nunderstand the causes and pain crises experienced by those with sickle cell. \nWhen my niece has a crisis, she complains of back pain, stomach pain, and she \nis not able to eat. This is emotional for me. There are peoples' lives at stake, \nyoung people losing their lives not being able to experience a full life.  \n \nSupporting A.B. 254 is very important to me and others, as not many people \nknow about sickle cell disease. To bring awareness is important, as not many \nmedical  providers  know  the  proper  procedures  to  treat  situations  in  the \nemergency room. Some patients do not know how to take care of themselves \nor  know  the  proper  procedures,  medications  or  supplements  they  need  to \nmanage their disease and stay healthy. This bill is important to those patients \nand their families. \n \nJAYSON BARNES: \nI have sickle cell anemia and it is sometimes hard to do the activities that other \nchildren can because I have so many complications of sickle cell. When I go to \nschool,  I  sometimes  feel  left  out  because  no  one  likes  me.  I  once  had  an \nincident with a teacher when I asked to see the nurse. She made me upset and \nsad when she told me I always had problems because I hurt a lot. I have to get \nthrough it because this disease is not going to go away. I am going to do my \nbest with this disease and hope this bill passes. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2019 \nPage 13 \n \nSONDRA WILLIAMS: \nI am 40 years old and have sickle cell disease. It has been difficult living with \nthis disease. As the young man before me said, school is something that is hard \nto go through as a child, as teachers do not understand. In the nurse's office, \nthey have very little understanding of the patients with sickle cell so you are not \ntreated very well. At the hospitals, transition is even more difficult when you \nare  older.  I  have  a  physician  who  understands;  however,  there  is  only  one \nfacility in Las Vegas for adults with sickle cell disease.  \n \nWhen you go to the emergency room, they treat you as if you are seeking \ndrugs. You do not get treated like a patient coming in with pain because they do \nnot see the pain. Your vital signs do not show the pain so they do not want to \nattend to you. I support A.B. 254 as it is needed right now. \n \nLINETTA BARNES (President, Sickled Not Broken Foundation of NV): \nI support A.B. 254 and have submitted written testimony (Exhibit G). I have \nalso provided a handout labeled \"Sickle Cell Disease Health Disparities\" that \nprovides information about a limited number of educated providers who feel \ncomfortable treating sickle cell, as well as a high rate of return to hospitals. I \nalso provided a document that covers the transition of age 18 to adulthood. \nPatients themselves do not know a lot about their disease and neither do the \nhealth care providers. Therefore, they have higher rates of emergency room \nvisits and deaths. \n \nI  am  a  health  care  provider  and  listen  daily  to  the  stigmas  and \nmisunderstandings related to sickle cell anemia and attempt to give guidance to \nthose  in  crisis.  I  work  with  a  nurse  who  works  on  a  transition  team.  She \nthanked me for allowing her to work with sickle cell families, as she was one \nwho thought they were all drug seekers because another doctor told her that, \nand the patient looked like that was the case.  \n \nI am hoping this bill will help to limit the number of deaths related to sickle cell \ndisease due to a treatable complication, and that prescriptions can be filled \nwithout complication. We need our teenagers to become adults and live long \nhealthy lives. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2019 \nPage 14 \n \nTINA  DORTCH  (Program  Manager,  Office  of  Minority  Health  and  Equity, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nThe Nevada Office of Minority Health and Equity supports A.B. 254. I will read \nfrom my written testimony (Exhibit H). \n \nJOANNA JACOB (Dignity Health-St. Rose Dominican): \nDignity Health-St. Rose Dominican supports A.B. 254. Chief Medical Officer \nDr. Chike Nzerue, who is the parent of a child with the disease, testified in the \nAssembly hearing on this bill, along with families affected by sickle cell disease. \nHe was contacted by some of the members involved in the grassroots efforts \nabout care in the Dignity Health-St. Rose Dominican hospitals. We are glad we \nwere able to meet with some of the patients' families. I wanted to put on the \nrecord that Dr. Nzerue, at our highest level of leadership in the hospital, has \ntaken this very seriously. We are educating our emergency room doctors and \nthe people who staff our emergency rooms within our facility, about the barriers \nthe patients have experienced and how we can improve. \n \nBecause  of  our  mission  and  values  about  dignity,  justice,  collaboration  and \nstewardship we wanted to signal to the patients that they have our support and \nongoing partnership to help work on efforts to improve care in southern Nevada. \n \nDr.  Nzerue  has  submitted  his  written  testimony  in  support  of  A.B. 254 \n(Exhibit I). \n \nTOM CLARK (Nevada Association of Health Plans): \nI reluctantly rise in opposition to A.B. 254. We worked with the bill sponsor \nwhen it was in the Assembly. I did have some minor clean-up language, but in \nAssemblywoman Neal's testimony, she addressed most of that language. We \nwill continue to work with her to ensure the intent is there. This is a horrific \ndisease. As an industry, we want to make sure all medically necessary issues \nare addressed so these patients get the treatment they deserve. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIf this clean-up language was included, would you change your opposition to \nsupport? \n \nMR. CLARK: \nIf the language is consistent with what we have and is added to the bill, we will \nbe in support. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2019 \nPage 15 \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nIs the language you said needs to be cleaned up so egregious that you could not \nsupport the bill as written? \n \nMR. CLARK:  \nIt  is  more  about  following  the  rules  of  the  Committee  because  we  have \nsuggested changes to the actual language of the bill that we rise in opposition. \nWe are confident in working with Assemblywoman Neal that these changes \nhave been made. We would then rise in support of the bill.  \n \nIt  was  brought  up  that  your  bill,  with  medical  facilities  understanding  the \ncultural effects of diseases like this, is going to go a long way toward that \neffort. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 254 and open the hearing on A.B. 317. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 317 (1st Reprint): Revises provisions governing the licensing \nand operation of certain medical facilities. (BDR 40-1034) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN MAGGIE CARLTON (Assembly District No. 14): \nI am here today to present A.B. 317 for your consideration and will be working \nfrom the Proposed Amendment 5880 (Exhibit J) as I go over the bill. \n \nThis bill deals with two general concepts. We were thrilled to hear the Governor \ndid include the Bureau of Consumer Protection in his budget. We know that in \nNevada, we have been talking anecdotally in the Legislature about the issues \nwith health care. It has been difficult to get actual data, and we have had to \ndecide on bills on the basis of sometimes insufficient information. Nevada has \ngotten a lot better in this respect, and I believe with the help of the Bureau and \nthe unique identifier, we will be able to get the information we need when we \nlook at the cost of health care. \n \nI found the Legislative Declaration from Colorado was so similar to what we are \nattempting with this bill that I felt I could use it as an example when writing this \nbill.  We  do  want  more  accountability  and  transparency  in  our  health  care \nsystem. Being able to look at cost is very important for customers in order for \nthem to make very tough health care decisions.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2019 \nPage 16 \n \nHaving the National Provider Identifier (NPI) proposed in this bill would generate \nthe necessary information, perhaps including the cost associated with seeking \nthose services. The  language is geared  toward the off-campus locations,  or \nwhat we have been calling the free-standing emergency rooms. It has been \nnoticed  that  often  these  off-campus  locations  use  the  same  NPI  for  billing \npurposes as the affiliated hospital or organization they belong to. Being able to \nhave a distinct NPI for each one of those off-campus facilities would give the \nBureau, this Committee and others interested in this issue, real data on what is \nactually happening. The bill would require all off-campus facilities to get this \nunique NPI. \n \nIt was brought to my attention there are other services being done off-campus; \ntherefore, the language was changed resulting in the Proposed Amendment. \n \nIn Section 1.2, subsection 2, paragraph (b), subparagraph (4) of the amendment \nwe are deleting from line 22, \"preventive, diagnostic, treatment\". We do not \nneed every lab and radiologist to get the NPI. We are looking more for those off-\ncampus  facilities.  It  is  focused  on  ambulatory,  surgery,  urgent  care  and \nemergency  room  services;  we  are  not  talking  about  blood  draws  or  other \nservices. \n \nOne  concern  related  to  the  Southern  Nevada  Health  District  is  not  making \ndecisions regarding trauma designation based on adequate community needs \nassessments.  In  2005,  trauma  designation  moved  from  the  State  to  Clark \nCounty. We thought taking it to the local counties was a better option at the \ntime. I believe we need to bring the State back in again to ensure that shortage \nareas are adequately identified and developed according to a two-tier evaluation \nprocess. \n \nThe language in Section 8 of the bill proposes the American College of Surgeons \nNeeds-Based Assessment of Trauma Systems (NBATS) should be applied to \nevaluate  whether  trauma  designation  should  be  granted  to  any  applicant. \nHowever, this would only be a small portion of the two-tier process this bill \nenvisions. It would concern the initial evaluation of the applications hospitals \nwould  submit  to  the  State,  while  researching  how  the  needs  assessments \nenvisioned by the language would be conducted. \n \nWe looked at the American College of Surgeons NBATS and read some of the \nminutes of the meetings they had. It became apparent their goal was to produce \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2019 \nPage 17 \n \na pragmatic and relatively simple tool that could be applied to the data that is \ncurrently  available.  The  tool  was  constructed  to  aid  the  assessment  of  the \nnumber  of trauma centers needed in a  specific geographical region called a \ntrauma services area. This is the key part that I was not thoroughly aware of \nuntil I learned more about it.  \n \nThe assessment tool is not meant to be the designation tool, and there is a \ndefinite difference between the two. The American College of Surgeons trauma \nneeds assessment presumes the need has already been evaluated and that we \nhave established the need on that level. This area could range in size from a \nsmall county to a multi-state region. In essence, they would be setting up what \nwe commonly call a health professional shortage area, but it would be related to \ntrauma.  \n \nWe apply a health professional shortage area variable for things such as federal \nloan repayment and federally qualified health centers on where they would be \nlocated. We also use it for J1 Waiver Job Placement Specialists for Physicians. \nWe currently have a system set up in the context of which we could look at an \narea and decide whether this is a trauma, or for lack of a better term, a desert \nor shortage area.  \n \nIs there an area in which we really need to place a trauma designation? The \nState would have the responsibility to look at it and use data to figure out what \nis needed. If there is a request for a trauma center designation, the State would \nuse this assessment tool as a small portion of it. There are four components \nthat would be considered, and the applicant would bring that to the State. The \nState would look at it and send it to the Southern Nevada Health District for \nreview. \n \nI have heard concerns about the health district's role in this. Not long ago, there \nwere a number of applications that were placed and not approved. It was then \ndiscussed  that  the  Southern  Nevada  Health  District  would  do  a  community \nneeds assessment to look at southern Nevada holistically as far as trauma goes. \nIt is now two-and-a-half years later, and that community needs assessment has \nstill not been done.  \n \nWe currently have trauma applications in the queue. You would think more \ntrauma is better, but that is not necessarily true. You need to have the right \nlevel  of  trauma.  There  is  a  difference  between  trauma  designation  and  an \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2019 \nPage 18 \n \nemergency room. There are experts here who can go into more detail and walk \nyou through some of those arguments. It is tough to figure out how trauma \ndesignation actually works. It is a fine balancing act making sure there are the \nright services, in the right place, with the right professionals, for the right level \nof trauma to ensure patients are taken care of. Those of us who have been \nthrough a trauma situation with a loved one know that the \"golden hour\" is very \nimportant.  We  have  heard  about  heart  attacks,  strokes  and  numerous \nemergencies where that first hour is magical. \n \nThe  concerns  that  have  been  brought  to  my  attention  are  that  in  order  to \naddress this issue, bringing the designation of trauma areas back to the State \nlevel could help resolve some of the problems. To be honest, and putting the \nfacts on the table, this would take local politics out of trauma designation. It \ndoes not belong there; this is a health care issue. It allows for a measured, \nthoughtful  and  consistent  approach  to  decision  making  when  it  comes  to \ndesignating trauma. We would conduct a Statewide needs assessment, review \nit  and  decide  what  needs  to  be  done.  There  would  also  be  a  Statewide \nevaluation and Statewide reporting. This Body would be able to go to the State \nand ask where we are on this, what do we need, where do we go and how we \naddress these issues. \n \nOn page 9, line 17 of the amendment, the original version was one year, which \nwas my mistake. In order to do a real evaluation, you would need more data \nthan was compiled. It was suggested to make it a five year look back to get real \ninformation. We know how things have grown in southern Nevada, and seen a \nlot of these free-standing, off-campus hospitals pop up in the last five years. \nHaving the unique NPI number for each facility, we will be able to get a good \nlook at what is going on, figure out where we really need trauma centers, and \nmake sure we put them in the right places. There are numerous levels of trauma \ndesignation and then there is an emergency room level. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIt looks like the county still has a role. Page 9, lines 26 through 27 states how \nthe county whose population is 700,000 or more shall adopt regulations and a \nplan for a comprehensive trauma system. Do you still see a role for the county? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN CARLTON: \nYes. I believe it should be a two-tier process. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2019 \nPage 19 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWhat are the State and county processes for a hospital that wants to add a new \ntrauma designation? \n \nRICHARD WHITLEY (Director, Department of Health and Human Services): \nI believe, as Assemblywoman Carlton mentioned, the needs assessment would \nbe the role of the State. The conditions in which a need is demonstrated and \nthe local regulation, which would be assessing that request for adding a trauma \ndesignation, would come forward. That is how we see it working together. The \nassessment, the role of the State to determine yes there is a need, or no there \nis not a need. Then the local jurisdiction would work with the requestor to bring \nthat forward.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe State would say we have done the full needs assessment, and in this \ngeneral area there is a need and this other area there is not a need. Anywhere \nthere is a no, it is a no. Anywhere it is a yes, there could be an applicant \ncoming forward and they would have to see how that applicant fits the need in \nthat yes area. Is that accurate? \n \nMR. WHITLEY: \nCurrently, that is how it works. The service area is defined. Sometimes people \naccess  services  that  are  outside  of  their  zip  code.  The  applicant  or  person \ninterested would bring forward the area they would be intending to serve. This \nis  where  the  data  would  come  in  handy  looking  at  the  number  of  events \noccurring in the area, the demographics and the distance to existing centers. \nHaving that laid out in a regular way so everyone has the same information, the \nfacility or hospital could apply for a trauma center using those variables to say \nthere is a shortage area and capture that shortage area. It does work well with \nprimary  health  care  and  other  designations  for  health  care  with  the  federal \ngovernment. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThis is what we are doing today. Would the applicant bring that study and data \nshowing the need for a trauma designation to the county, the State or both? \n \nMR. WHITLEY: \nI would see them bringing it forward to the county in which they were wanting \nto pursue a trauma designation because they have utilized the data available to \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2019 \nPage 20 \n \nthem. They may work in concert with the State while they are completing the \napplication. Hopefully, the intent would be that it is a transparent process so the \ndata is available to, and utilized by, everyone. That would be the State's role. \nThe local facility would work with the local emergency medical services and \ntheir regulations to bring forward that specific request to add a designation.  \n \nThe State would do the needs assessment at regular intervals, utilizing all the \ndata to make that available for their request. There is some overlap. You get \napproval from the State in terms of it qualifying as a shortage area. They may \nactually  want  to  construct  an  area  that  does  not  fit  in  a  way  you  would \nnaturally look at it because they are defining the service area. They would work \nwith the local entity to better define the area. They would make their request to \nthem utilizing our data that states it does represent a shortage area, so they are \nnot wasting time applying and waiting until it comes to the State to say it does \nnot meet the criteria. We want the known to be there from the beginning so the \napplication could meet with success when they locally apply. It currently works \nthat way with the federal government for the designation of shortage areas, so \nit is not a surprise to anyone. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThey would still need a yes from both the county and the State? \n \nMR. WHITLEY: \nThat is correct. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nIs there a time span for the survey or reflection to go to the county or the \nState? \n \nMR. WHITLEY: \nWhat I would intend to do for the State would be to work with the county and \nstakeholders to establish the criteria and the needs assessment. We would do it \nin a regulatory way so all of the variables, wait times and demographics are all \navailable  to  everyone.  The  Board  of  Health  meets  every  other  month. \nSequentially, the local Board of Health that makes a determination, and the \nStatewide Board of Health could sync up, and within a two-month period get \nlocal and State approval once the needs assessment is completed. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2019 \nPage 21 \n \nOne of the reasons we like regulations is because they are nimble. If there is \nauthority to develop something, we can. It still comes back to the Legislative \nCommission when we finalize regulations. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nDoes the State define the area where someone would want to open a trauma \ncenter?  Would  someone  wanting  to  open  a  trauma  center,  with  the  same \ninformation you mentioned, be able to say a particular area needs a trauma \ncenter, or would that be up to the State? \n \nMR. WHITLEY: \nIn terms of the needs-based assessment, and having the data available and the \nvariables that are looked at, would be a step in that process. You would work \nlocally to say you would like to complete an application for a trauma designation \nand believe you meet all of the States criteria for distance, demographics and \nserving unmet needs.  The key of the needs-based assessment would be to \nestablish unmet needs in a specific geographical area. However, it may be one \nthat is configured by the facility in terms of serving a specific area because it is \nan underserved area. That assessment would be done by the State first. The \nlocal government would then work with the provider in terms of the capacity of \nthe provider to be that designation and gain local approval. Coming full circle \nwith the State, we would be in sync and approval could be granted. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nHow do the State and local government work together to approve a request and \nmake regulations to open a trauma center in a specific area? \n \nMR. WHITLEY: \nIt would not be a matter of regulations each time a request is submitted. There \nwould be a set of regulations to determine the variables and data that would be \nused to designate the need, which would be determined up front. Where I think \nthe variable could be is that locally, a hospital will deliberately want to serve \npeople in a specific area as they have done the analysis and determined that \narea is underserved. When they apply to the State, they are putting a definition \nto the geographical area. The State has the data and the ability to say this is a \nshortage area and meets all of the criteria. I can see that same process working. \nThe State would want regulatory ability to lay that out with the stakeholder so \nwe are all utilizing the same information to determine what unmet need is in a \nunified way. Much like the federally qualified health centers, I would anticipate \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2019 \nPage 22 \n \nthe facility making the request would utilize all of this information and have \nalready done the work to determine the unmet need before moving forward with \ntheir request. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nSo the State would not make the map of where the facility would be located as \nmuch as these are the areas we would include or could be included. Then the \norganization that wants to open the trauma center would go to the county and \nshow them the area they want to show has unmet need for a potential trauma \ncenter. Is this correct? \n \nMR. WHITLEY: \nAs a facility, I believe they are saying they are ready to open this center and \nmeet the needs that can be identified. The local government would then assess \nthat they can meet the needs to open the center. That is where I believe the \nrole  locally,  and  that  of  the  State,  can  complement  each  other.  The \nestablishment of need is the State's role as stated in the bill. The role locally \nwould be to demonstrate the ability to accomplish that. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN CARLTON: \nThe  State  doing  the  needs  assessment  is  key  for  setting  up  these  trauma \nservice areas. Depending on what that trauma service shortage area looks like, \nand  where  that  particular  entity  would  want  to  set  up  a  center,  the  State \nthrough their needs assessment would be able to tell exactly what areas truly \nneed a trauma designation. \n \nUsing the unique NPI will give us a better idea of what areas need a trauma \ndesignation as we currently use the NPI of the center where the services are \nbeing provided. We know a lot of satellite hospitals have been opened. If you \nlooked at the numbers right now, it would look like there is only one hospital, \nbut  we  know  there  are  a  number  of  small,  free-standing  emergency  rooms \nwithin ten miles of that hospital. You would think that would be a good area to \nput a trauma center; however, you have a number of other facilities there so it \nwould not. We cannot quantify them because there is no unique NPI for each \none of them.  \n \nThe identifier language is important in order to tell where and what services are \nbeing provided. We need to know if they are simply an emergency room or a \nLevel II or Level III trauma facility. If there is a Level I trauma and an emergency \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2019 \nPage 23 \n \nroom, and you are missing that mid-level of care that may be a good spot for \nthat mid-level provider. But if you have two Level II trauma centers and an \nemergency room, you need a Level I trauma center. You need to look at what \nlevel of service is needed in a particular service area. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI am looking at this as two different bills. One is about the off-campus location \nof an \"emergency room with 16 beds\", and a trauma center which is different \nthan an emergency room.  \n \nThe second being the \"trauma center\" as opposed to the emergency room, \nwhere you get into the different trauma levels. Are you saying that all of the \nemergency rooms are also under the same State needs assessment before they \nput up an emergency room? \n \nMR. WHITLEY: \nFor data purposes, it is important to know what capacity is in the community. \nThere are emergency rooms that are part of a hospital that are off-campus. \nCurrently, they are counted as that hospital from the address of the licensed \nhospital. This helps us capture a better understanding of where all services are, \nand of the landscape of services for emergency response in a community, which \ndoes  go  to  an  overall  understanding  of  what  that  community  capacity  or \ndesignated area is. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nMy question would be whether the State is going to decide where there is \nenough  need  so  the  local  county  or  health  district  can  decide  where  a \nfree-standing emergency room with 16 beds is located. Are we going to get into \nthat or is it just the trauma center you are going to have your fingerprints on? \n \nMR. WHITLEY: \nI believe I have my fingerprints on both from a licensure standpoint. For the \nsake of this bill, this does not intend to determine the designation area, only to \ncollect the data so the unique NPI captures the data. Our statute already allows \na regulation authority for us to license off-site facilities. What is not captured is \nthat it is physically off-site. The data is only collected as part of the hospital. \n \nThere are two parts to this bill. As described, the first part is existing services \nso we can accurately understand where they are located. We are not trying to \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2019 \nPage 24 \n \nmanage that with any more controls. We just want to know where they are. \nThe controls are already in place. The licensed hospital is responsible for the \nservices that occur there. Nothing additional is being done regulatory to that \nmethod of delivering services. It is just the trauma piece with the two-step \napproach. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nSo the trauma piece in this bill is where the State has a \"dog in the fight\" of \nwhere the trauma center will be, as opposed to the free-standing emergency \nroom  which  could  be  anywhere  they  think  they  can  make  a  living  without \nhaving to go through this two-tiered system. \n \nMR. WHITLEY: \nThat is correct. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nFor the record, all of this only applies to data collection in 700,000+ population \ncounties? \n \nMR. WHITLEY: \nYes, that is also my understanding. \n \nBOBBETTE BOND (Culinary Health Fund): \nWe have been working on the trauma system issues with regard to trauma \ndesignation in southern Nevada since the Regional Trauma Advisory Board was \ncreated. I wanted to clarify what we think would be an ideal structure based on \nthe legislation that is being proposed. \n \nWe are hoping to get this bill passed in a way that would allow the State to do \na comprehensive needs assessment as there is a gap there. The State has the \ncapacity to do it; the county was supposed to do it and has not. We have a hole \nwe are attempting to fill. \n \nAfter that happens, we would like a process to ensure that if there is no need, \nthen there is no designation. If a need is found, if there is a shortage of beds, if \nthere is an area where the transport time is not working, if patients are left with \nunmet needs, then there would be a determination by the State that there is a \ncapacity problem. Then the county would have the responsibility to figure out \nhow to ensure that capacity is filled.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2019 \nPage 25 \n \nWe would promote the idea that the county would create a request for proposal \n(RFP) rather than a hospital saying we want to fill this role. We would open it up \nand let all hospitals have the decision on whether they want to serve that need. \nThen have it be more of a process where you are looking at solving the capacity \nproblem and what resources are best, rather than waiting for the hospital to put \nforward a desire that may not meet the State's determination of need. \n \nMAYA HOLMES (Culinary Health Fund): \nWe have heard about the process and the structure the Culinary Health Fund \nwould like. I would like to talk about why we think this bill is so important. We \nstrongly  support  A.B.  317  and  think  the  State  needs  to  have  a  clear  and \nvigorous role in identifying areas where there is a shortage of trauma care in \nNevada and assessing the need for trauma expansion. \n \nUnfortunately, what we are seeing in southern Nevada is the opposite of this \nprocess. In 2016, the Southern Nevada Health District had three applications for \nhospitals to add trauma services, which would have doubled the number of \ntrauma centers. At the time, the Southern Nevada Health District and the Board \nof Health determined there was no unmet need in the community and denied all \nthree  applications.  They  directed  the  Board  to  do  a  community-wide  needs \nassessment.  \n \nNow a few years later, we have five applications for trauma centers which \ncould nearly triple the number of trauma centers in the southern Nevada area. \nThe final comprehensive community needs assessment has not been done; it is \nstill a work in process. We think this is a very backward and flawed process. \n \nWe find that this bill is important because trauma centers are obviously critical \nto ensuring the health, safety and well-being of residents and visitors. But a \nflood  of  trauma  centers  that  does  not  rely  on  a  comprehensive  needs \nassessment will only undermine our existing system and drive up health care \ncosts.  As  Assemblywoman  Carlton  stated,  it  is  really  that  fine  balance  of \nactually understanding what the need is.  \n \nIn other states, where there has been a proliferation of trauma centers, the \nresults have threatened existing trauma systems. There has also been plenty of \nresearch done showing trauma centers need a certain level of patients to ensure \nquality  patient  outcomes.  Trauma  teams  need  to  treat  enough  patients  to \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2019 \nPage 26 \n \ndevelop and maintain their skills and expertise. Trauma centers also need a \ncertain level of patients to remain financially viable. \n \nThe Culinary Health Fund believes A.B. 317 will ensure a comprehensive needs \nassessment is conducted, and will utilize criteria recommended by the American \nCollege  of  Surgeons.  The  assessment  will  be  incredibly  valuable  as  it  will \nevaluate the impact of new centers on the existing trauma center so we do not \noversaturate the system and ultimately undermine it. \n \nWe  also  support  requiring  the  unique  NPI  number  for  off-campus  hospital \nfree-standing emergency rooms and urgent cares. As has been stated, this is a \ncritical transparency reporting requirement that other facilities such as hospitals \nand  ambulatory  surgery  centers  are  already  providing.  As  payers,  this  is \nincredibly important information for us to help direct our members to the most \nappropriate care. It will also be vital information for the DHHS to analyze health \ncare costs and access in the State. \n \nMR. CLARK: \nThe Nevada Association of Health Plans supports A.B. 317. \n \nSTACIE SASSO (Health Services Coalition): \nThe Health Services Coalition is in support of regulations around expansion to \nthe trauma system as it sits today. Currently, there is limited ability to carefully \nmanage the expansion around the ability to create or expand trauma centers in \nNevada. While additional trauma care sounds like a good idea in theory, it poses \nrisks  to  the  entire  State  by  placing  the  existing  trauma  facilities  at  risk  of \noversaturation.  \n \nMore  trauma  centers  does  not  always  mean  faster  or  better  care.  In  many \ncases, patients may still bypass a facility to access care at a higher level trauma \ncenter. There is also concern over the cost of care when a trauma patient is \nactivated.  Trauma  facilities  currently  charge  up  to  $50,000  for  a  single \nactivation. There are no regulations in place to set pricing for activation fees. As \na  result,  unnecessary  growth  of  the  trauma  system  will  also  result  in  even \nhigher costs of health care for the patient. \n \nIn addition to concerns around oversaturation and cost, there are also limited \nphysicians  in  Nevada.  Expanding  trauma  centers  without  proven  need  may \ncreate coverage issues at area hospitals and other established centers. It would \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2019 \nPage 27 \n \nbe helpful to have a process in place where the State has the ability to review \nthe system as a whole, and review growth based on demonstrated need rather \nthan individualized neighborhoods and hospitals.  \n \nThe missing step today is a process to determine if there is a shortage capacity \nin the trauma system prior to asking neighborhood hospitals to apply and be \nevaluated. When a need is identified, an RFP process should be initiated to \ndetermine appropriate facilities to be considered for designation. With no proven \nneed, there should be no applications being reviewed.  \n \nYour support of the legislation is critical to protect Nevada's current trauma \nsystem. \n \nRUSTY MCALLISTER (Nevada State AFL-CIO): \nThe Nevada State AFL-CIO supports A.B. 317. A vast majority of the members \nthat belong to our organization are covered by health plans that are either an \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act plan or nonprofit self-funded plans. \nWe are in support of this legislation and believe it is appropriate to have a needs \nassessment done in a nonpolitical fashion. The plans we currently have are \nconstantly  watching  our  costs  as  they  are  nonprofit  plans.  There  are  no \nshareholders. We are trying to keep our costs down.  \n \nIf you are transported to an emergency room for a possible fractured hip and \nthat facility is now designated as a trauma a center, it may be up to $50,000 to \nactivate the trauma team. This could be for something you would get treated for \nin  the  same  fashion  regardless  of  whether  it  was  a  trauma  center  or  an \nemergency room. It would be more appropriate to make sure the need is there; \nthat  you  are  not  peeling  patients  off  of  hospitals  that  are  already  trauma \ncenters. If there is a need based on distance, time, travel or other factors, by all \nmeans do it in a controlled and organized fashion as opposed to having five \nhospitals in southern Nevada submit applications for trauma centers purely as a \nfinancial means. \n \nJIM SULLIVAN (Culinary Union): \nThe Culinary Union supports A.B. 317 for all of the reasons my colleagues at \nthe  Culinary  Health  Fund  laid  out  and  would  like  to  thank  Assemblywoman \nCarlton for bringing this bill forward. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2019 \nPage 28 \n \nMARCIA TURNER (Chief Administrative Officer, University Medical Center): \nUniversity Medical Center supports A.B. 317 and appreciates the efforts on the \nlocal and State level to help address this issue. \n \nALFREDO ALONSO (UnitedHealth Group Inc.): \nUnitedHealth  Group  Inc.  supports  A.B. 317  and  we  thank  Assemblywoman \nCarlton for her hard work on the bill. Transparency is extremely important for \nour members. The first section of the bill helps with that goal and identifying \nwho these folks are and how they fit in the overall health care landscape. With \nrespect to trauma, you are creating a system that is going to be more robust \nwith more information and data to help make better decisions. \n \nNICK VASSILIADIS (Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield Healthcare Solutions): \nAnthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield Healthcare Solutions supports A.B. 317. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing A.B. 317 and open the hearing on A.B. 387. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 387 (1st Reprint): Establishes a program to provide services to \nfamilies of certain children with a mental illness or emotional disturbance. \n(BDR 39-1000) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN SHEA BACKUS (Assembly District No. 37): \nToday, it is my pleasure to introduce A.B. 387 which creates a pathway for \nfamilies on the verge of seeking services for their child's serious mental illness \nor emotional disturbance through relinquishment of parental custody to the Clark \nCounty  Department  of  Family  Services,  despite  the  absence  of  abuse  and \nneglect. This is so the child can receive services through an appropriate child-\nserving agency. To prevent such custody relinquishment, I bring before this \nCommittee A.B. 387. \n \nAssembly Bill 387 is essentially divided into two parts. The first part is to gather \ndata to get an understanding of cases involving children going into the system \nseeking mental illness or serious emotional assistance when there is no finding \nof abuse and neglect. \n \nThe second part is to establish a task force to develop a program to prevent the \nrelinquishment of custody or voluntary surrender of children to an agency which \nprovides child welfare services solely to allow the children to receive services to \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2019 \nPage 29 \n \naddress  a  mental  illness  or  emotional  disturbance  when  there  has  been  no \nfinding of abuse or neglect. \n \nSection 7.5, subsection 1, paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) provide for what data is to \nbe collected and reported by each agency providing child welfare services to the \nDHHS. \n \nSpecifically, each agency is to report: \n \n(a) The number of children for whom custody is relinquished to the \nagency or who were voluntarily placed with the agency pursuant to \nNRS 432B.360 during the last three years due to mental illness or \nemotional disturbance; and \n(b) Information concerning the length of time the agency provided \nsuch service and the status of the children upon termination of \nsuch services; and \n(c) Of the children identified, how many remain in custody of or \nplaced with the agency. \n \nThis information is to be reported by July 1, 2020. The DHHS is to then submit \nto  the  Director  of  the  Legislative  Counsel  Bureau  for  transmittal  to  the \nLegislative  Committee  on  Child  Welfare  and  Juvenile  Justice,  a  report \nsummarizing this information by July 31, 2020. \n \nSection  3  sets  forth  the  establishment  of  the  task  force  and  who  will  be \nappointed by the Director of the DHHS. While the task force members are not \nentitled to additional pay or per diem, they are to be relieved of their duties \nwithout  loss  of  regular  compensation  or  required  to  use  annual  vacation  or \ncompensatory time for their absence.  \n \nSection 4, subsection 1, paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of the bill provides what \nthe task force shall do which includes: \n \n(a) Prescribing procedures for conducting the review by a clinical \nteam  appointed  pursuant  to  Section  5  of  this  act  and  the \narrangement of the provision of services pursuant to that section; \nand \n(b) Develop and carry out procedures to increase the ability of the \nservices  described  in  subsection  3  of  section  5  of  this  act \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2019 \nPage 30 \n \nthroughout this State to allow children to receive those services in \nor near their homes; and \n(c) Provide for outreach to and education of parents and providers \nof mental health services concerning the services available through \nthe program developed pursuant to section 3 of this act; and \n(d)  Make  recommendations  to  the  Department  concerning  the \nadoption of any regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of \nsections 2 to 6 of this act. \n \nSection  4,  subsection  2  requires  that  the  DHHS  shall  adopt  regulations \nnecessary to carry out the provisions of this act, including the manner in which \nthe  cost  of  providing  such  services  will  be  paid.  The  regulations  must  also \nrequire that the parent use any insurance or otherwise contribute to the cost to \nthe extent of his or her ability. \n \nSection 5 provides  for the Director to  appoint at least one clinical team to \nreview cases where a child has been admitted to a hospital or mental health \nfacility and is at risk of relinquishment to secure such mental health services but \nhas not been subject to abuse and neglect. The clinical team is also to develop a \nplan  outlining  services  necessary  to  treat  the  child  in  order  to  avoid \nrelinquishment or voluntary surrender of such child. The clinical team is also to \narrange for the provision of services necessary to stabilize the child for not more \nthan 90 days while a plan of care is being developed. \n \nSection 6 requires the agencies to provide an annual report to the DHHS setting \nforth the number of children who were relinquished into the custody of the \nagency or voluntarily surrendered to the agency the year prior because of the \nchild  needing  services  for  mental  health  or  emotional  disturbance  by \nJanuary 15. The DHHS is to submit a report to the Director of the Legislative \nCounsel Bureau summarizing this information by February 15. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nHow did we get away from the fiscal note in Clark County without having it in \nWashoe or any other counties? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN BACKUS: \nPrimarily, we looked at the data over the next two years. If you look at the last \nsection of the bill providing for the deadlines, most everything is to occur within \nthis biennium \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2019 \nPage 31 \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nDo we have enough mental health facilities in Nevada to accommodate this? \nLast Session, children were being sent elsewhere because we did not have the \ncapacity here. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN BACKUS: \nWe were trying to figure out what kind of numbers we were looking at and \nwhether we were looking at hundreds of children for the purposes of A.B. 387. \nWhen the Clark County Department of Family Services testified, they said it \nwas about one child per month. That is for the children where there is no \nfinding  of  abuse  and  neglect.  In  my  personal  experience  with  representing \nchildren in foster care, this is an issue.  \n \nOne of the bills you will hopefully hear on Wednesday, A.B. 298 deals with \nadopting  a  plan  for  the  recruitment  of  foster  homes.  There  is  a  friendly \namendment centered around how many children are subject to being placed out \nof State. We have contemplated combining the two bills; however, this one \nseems limited to the children outside of abuse and neglect and the other one \nseemed more appropriate. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 298: Requires an agency which provides child welfare services \nto  adopt  a  plan  for  the  recruitment  and  retention  of  foster  homes. \n(BDR 38-1061) \n \nROSS  E.  ARMSTRONG  (Administrator,  Division  of  Child  and  Family  Services, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nWe had 359 voluntary relinquishments in the last fiscal year which included all \nrelinquishments; not just those looking to receive services. The vast majority are \nbiological parents. They relinquish their rights in a negotiated open adoption \nsituation where they would be terminated otherwise in court so they relinquish \nrather than have them terminated.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDo you think it is a relatively small number of children who meet the narrow \ndefinition of this mental health challenge that is leading to their relinquishment? \n \nMR. ARMSTRONG: \nWe do think it is rare, but no parent should have to give up their child just to \nreceive medical care. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2019 \nPage 32 \n \nCHAIR RATTI:  \nI will accept a motion on A.B. 387. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN MOVED TO DO PASS A.B. 387. \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 387 and open the hearing on A.B. 430. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 430 (1st Reprint): Providing for a study concerning maternal, \ninfant and early childhood home visitation services. (BDR S-1001) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN BACKUS: \nIt  is  also  my  pleasure  to  introduce  A.B.  430  which  requires  the  Legislative \nCommittee on Child Welfare and Juvenile Justice to conduct an Interim study \nconcerning maternal, infant and early childhood home visitation services. \n \nThis bill originated with the concept of establishing a voluntary program for \nexpectant mothers who would likely have a case opened with Child Protective \nServices following the birth of their infant. This case would likely involve drug \nabuse or others issues that may give rise to such removal.  \n \nThe goal was for the mother to engage in early assistance to address issues \nthat could give rise to a finding of abuse and neglect following the birth of her \nchild. However, when the bill came out it did not look that way. It was overly \nbroad. After working with stakeholders on this bill, it was discovered there was \na  lack  of  information  as  to  identifying  those  in  need  of  services,  what \ndepartment would oversee the services, communication to those identified and \nhow the program would work. \n \nLikewise, there were grave concerns about the program not being voluntary and \npotentially violating one's Fourth Amendment protections. This program was \nnever intended to do such. With the outstanding inquiries, it was realized the \nbest way to work toward the original intent of this bill was through an Interim \nstudy. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2019 \nPage 33 \n \nWhen we were looking at amending the bill, another point was raised by the \nClark County Department of Family Services regarding potential federal grants \navailable. When trying to develop a program that could take advantage of those \nfederal grants, we realized we were missing a lot of information. The best way \nto  handle  this  was  an  Interim  study.  Today,  I  was  reading  the  Las  Vegas \nReview-Journal  and  provided  you  with  some  additional  information  looking \nforward to what could be studied in the Interim and what we could do to \nbenefit families. There was actually the loss of a grant program causing one of \nour Clark County organizations called Healthy Start program to no longer service \nfamilies of women enrolled in the program who could not be absorbed by any \nother communities and 140 women were no longer serviced.  \n \nWe had the pleasure of having Cam Scott with Nurse-Family Partnership join us \nduring  the  hearing  before  the  Assembly  Committee  on  Health  and  Human \nServices. Nurse-Family Partnership currently works with 200 families in Clark \nCounty through the Southern Nevada Health District which can currently assist \nup  to  240  families.  Mr.  Scott  offered  testimony  about  the  success  of  the \nNurse-Family  Partnership,  which  included  the  reduction  in  child  abuse  and \nneglect. It also included information on the reduction in emergency room visits \nfrom accidents and poisoning, the reduction in language delays, fewer behavior \nand intellectual problems at age six, and the reduction in pre-term delivery for \nwomen who smoke. \n \nIn Nevada, Nurse-Family Partnership looked at the cost savings and return on \ninvestment of its program. There was a total average cost of $13,383 per \nNevada family, having an average enrollment of 614.6 days. The forecast model \non the return for a child on his or her 18th birthday would be a State and \nfederal cost savings of $20,006 per family served. When considering broader \nsavings to society, including gains in work, wages and quality of life with the \nreduction  of  out-of-pocket  payments,  child  welfare,  special  education  and \ncriminal justice, the benefit equals $56,839 per family served. A copy of the \ntrial outcomes and return on investment in Nevada have been supplied to the \nCommittee Manager. \n \nThis  bill  is  now  set  forth  under  Section  1.5,  subsection  1,  paragraph  a, \nsubparagraphs  (1)  through  (5)  to  which  the  Interim  study  will  consider  the \nfollowing, without limitation: \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2019 \nPage 34 \n \n (1)  Identify  communities  that  demonstrate  a  high  level  of  risk \nfactors known to impair childhood development, and \n(2) Identify pregnant women who may benefit from receiving home \nvisitation services after the birth of the child; and \n(3) Identify existing programs in this State that provide maternal, \ninfant and early childhood home visitation services; and \n(4) Analyze past efforts in this State to use identified risk factors to \naddress needs and target resources; and \n(5) Evaluate the collection of data concerning families who receive \nhome visitation services in this State. \n \nAdditionally, the Committee will provide findings and recommendations \nfor the legislation relating to the study. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nWe heard a bill last week on maternal mortality. I am wondering if this could \ndovetail on this bill. Is there any connection with respect to the grants they \ncould receive or perhaps some peripheral organizations that could help fund \nthis? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN BACKUS: \nI am a co-sponsor on that maternal mortality bill. I did not put the two together \nuntil I saw the Las Vegas Review-Journal article on infant mortality and realized \nwhat the Healthy Start Program was doing. Part of the Healthy Start Program \nwas  to  look  at  decreasing  mortality  rates.  I  am  unsure  as  to  where  the \nsponsor's study is going to fall. This would be specific and could be broader \nthan just looking at maternity, but also looking at early childhood. \n \nKATHRYN ROOSE (Deputy Administrator, Division of Child and Family Services, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nWe would like to thank the Assemblywoman for allowing us to participate in the \namendments  of  these  bills.  The  Division  of  Child  and  Family  Services, \nspecifically Child Welfare, is undergoing some reform based on the Family First \nPrevention Services Act. This provides a Title IV-E reimbursement for services \nto prevent removal of children from their homes. The Nurse-Family Partnership \nis one of the approved interventions we will be exploring. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2019 \nPage 35 \n \nCHAIR RATTI:  \nI will accept a motion on A.B. 430. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN MOVED TO DO PASS A.B. 430. \n \nSENATOR HARDY SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRemainder of page intentionally left blank; signature page to follow.   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2019 \nPage 36 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSeeing no further business, we are adjourned at 5:04 p.m. \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nVickie Polzien, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2019 \nPage 37 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nExhibit / \nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \n# of pages \n  A  2    Agenda \n  B  5    Attendance Roster \nA.B. 76  C  9  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nA.B. 129  D  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nTable Displaying Incidence of \nDiagnosis of Sickle Cell \nA.B. 254  E  1  Assemblywoman Dina Neal \nDisorder and Medical \nConditions \nSickle Cell Disease Summary \nA.B. 254  F  3  Assemblywoman Dina Neal \nBy Race \nLinetta Barnes / Sickled Not \nA.B. 254  G  1  Testimony in Support \nBroken Foundation \nTina Dortch / Department of \nA.B. 254  H  3  Testimony in Support \nHealth and Human Services \nChike M.

(BDR 40-1221) \n \nSTEVE SISOLAK (Governor): \nThank  you,  Chairwoman  Ratti  and  members  of  the  Committee,  for  the \nopportunity to present this bill. I am honored to be here. \n \nI am pleased to present to you today, at long last, the Nevada Patient Protection \nCommission (PPC). This is a concept I talked a lot about on the campaign trail. \nOver  the  last  few  months,  after  many  discussions  with  Legislators  and \nstakeholders,  it  has  evolved  into  a  comprehensive  independent  commission \ndedicated to innovative approaches to health care policy in this State. \n \nMy vision in establishing the PPC is to bring everyone together to work on the \nhealth care issues that we so often discuss, but may not have the time to \nresolve in the limited 120 days of a Legislative Session. \n \nThe PPC will take a comprehensive look at the state of health care in Nevada \nand identify areas we need to improve, things we are doing well and more ways \nwe can ensure that access to health care is available to all Nevadans, no matter \ntheir ZIP code. \n \nAs I often say, health care is only accessible if it is affordable, and the PPC will \nexamine health care costs, including prescription drugs, and the primary factors \ndriving  those  costs.  The  PPC  will  also  review  the  disparity  of  care  among \ndifferent  communities,  including  the  adequacy  of  health  care  providers  and \navailability of health insurance plans. \n \nAs we know, the policies coming out of Washington, D.C. can have a dramatic \neffect on our State health care system. The PPC will monitor changes at the \nfederal level and find ways to keep health care accessible and affordable for \nNevadans regardless of the instability in Washington. \n \nThe PPC will have 11 members, whom I will appoint with recommendations \nfrom Legislative Leadership. The membership will include representation from \nacross  the  industry;  health  plans,  providers,  hospitals  and  pharmaceutical \ncompanies  with  an  academic  experienced  in  health  care  policy.  Most \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 15, 2019 \nPage 4 \n \nimportantly,  it  will  include  patient  advocates  to  represent  the  voice  of \nNevadans, who are the consumers of health care. \n \nThe PPC will establish subcommittees to bring more stakeholders to the table to \ndo the heavy lifting on specific health care policies. \n \nIn order to be successful, the PPC will need an Executive Director and additional \nsupport staff. I also expect the ex-officio members to bring the full resources of \ntheir respective agencies to help in the Commission's work. \n \nAs  you  can  see,  the  scope  of  the  PPC  is  designed  to  be  far-reaching,  yet \nflexible, because the PPC will also be tasked with evaluating itself and its role in \nour  State.  This  may  involve  more  comprehensive  oversight  or  regulatory \nfunction sometime in the future. \n \nIt is my goal by the next Legislative Session, the PPC will have made a thorough \nreview of our health care system and offer concrete recommendations to the \nLegislature on what we need to do in Carson City to expand access to quality, \naffordable health care for all Nevadans. \n \nNevada  is  unique.  With  our  extraordinary  growth,  the  health  care  needs  of \nNevadans are changing quickly and dramatically, but we are still a State where \nwe can come together from all sides of the aisle and work together. I look \nforward to collaborating with each of you to improve the provisions of health \ncare for Nevadans in all corners of the State. \n \nThank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Committee members. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI would like to know how you envision this Commission interacting with the \nLegislature that already has numerous health care committees who meet during \nthe Interim. \n \nALLISON COMBS (Policy Director, Office of the Governor): \nThere is language under section 9 that addresses this issue. The PPC will work \nin  collaboration  and  will  not  take  the  place  of  any  existing  Legislative  or \nExecutive  Branch  Committee.  It  will  have  broad  oversight  and  work  in \nconjunction with all the Committees. There are many areas within health care \nand so many topics that no one Committee can cover everything. The PPC will \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 15, 2019 \nPage 5 \n \nprovide a forum for collaboration and bring in all the data and information. It will \nnot overlap the others. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI  have  questions  about  the  confidentiality  provisions  in  section  7  which \nauthorize  the  Executive  Director  to  access  information  maintained  by  State \nagencies,  including  information  that  is  otherwise  confidential.  The  Executive \nDirector can see it, but if it is to be used by the PPC, do they maintain that \nsame level of confidentiality? Can the PPC access that information? \n \nMS. COMBS: \nYes, the Executive Director can access confidential information in the same \nmanner as other State agencies. There are strong provisions to make sure that \ninformation maintains its confidentiality as required by State, federal and any \nother law that may apply. Any information that goes to the public would need \nto be in aggregate form to protect the confidentiality of the information. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAre there provisions that would allow the PPC to go into closed session where \nthere are instances in which it is necessary to see the \"playing field\" to make \nhard decisions? Would that information be available to the PPC but not to the \npublic? \n \nMS. COMBS: \nThere are no closed door provisions in S.B. 544 at this time. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIt also appears the confidentiality pertains to information that State agencies \nalready have access to. There are also stakeholders that represent payers and \nstakeholders that represent providers. If those entities are interested in sharing \ninformation  for  the  furtherance  of  the  PPC,  but  they  want  to  do  that  in  a \nconfidential setting, can they do that? \n \nMS. COMBS: \nThat is not currently provided in the bill. We can have those conversations to \nsee if this is needed. The language addresses information contained in State \nagencies.  The idea is the PPC will rely  heavily on State agencies and their \ninformation. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 15, 2019 \nPage 6 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs there anyone in support of S.B. 544? \n \nBARRY GOLD (AARP Nevada): \nYou have heard me testify many times about the access to quality, affordable \nhealth care. This is what AARP works on and what it thinks about all the time. \nAARP is in support of the S.B. 544 and looks forward to working with the PPC. \nOn  behalf  of  the  348,000  members  and  all  Nevada  families,  we  urge  this \nCommittee to support access to quality, affordable health care. \n \nVIVIAN LEAL (Indivisible Northern Nevada): \nI will read my prepared testimony (Exhibit C) in support of S.B. 544. \n \nNICK  VASSILIADIS  (Anthem,  Inc.  and  Affiliates,  Anthem  Blue  Cross  and  Blue \nShield; Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield Healthcare Solutions):  \nWe believe this is a good approach to solving some of the issues in health care. \nWe believe this will take a holistic approach and look forward to working with \nthe PPC.  \n \nTRAY ABNEY (America's Health Insurance Plans): \nWe know that health care is an important issue to every Nevadan. We are ready \nto work with the Governor and the PPC. We support S.B. 544. \n \nCATHERINE O'MARA (Nevada State Medical Association): \nWe support S.B. 544. We appreciate the focused look at health care. The duties \nare ambitious and comprehensive; Nevadans deserve that. We appreciate the \nfocus on patient advocates. We have complained for many years about the \ninadequacy of networks and no one can articulate it better than the patients. \nWe appreciate the inclusion of providers and hope that physicians will be part of \nthat. We are ready to work with the PPC. \n \nJENNY REESE (PhRMA): \nThe PhRMA is in support of S.B. 544 and looks forward to participating during \nthe Interim. \n \nJIM WADHAMS (Nevada Hospital Association): \nWe  appreciate  the  breadth  and  scope  of  S.B.  544  and  look  forward  to \nparticipating with the PPC. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 15, 2019 \nPage 7 \n \nJENNIFER LAZOVICH (Renown Health; Hometown Health): \nWe are in support of S.B. 544. \n \nBOBBETTE BOND (Culinary Health Fund; Unite Here Health): \nWe are happy Nevada is taking an important step to take a comprehensive look \nat health care. We have had a couple decades where we had nowhere to go for \nhealth care leadership that would cross several industries. We see this as an \nopportunity to create change in Nevada. I want to emphasize the importance of \nthe patient. Many times the patient's voice is not heard. \n \nCHRIS FERRARI (Dignity Health - St. Rose Dominican): \nWe are Las Vegas' only not-for-p  rofit, faith-based health care system. We \noriginally started in 1947 with three acute care and four neighborhood hospitals \nand 6 community outreach centers. We are in support of S.B. 544 and look \nforward to being an active participant in the meetings. \n \nCAROLINE MELLO ROBERSON (NARAL Pro-Choice Nevada): \nWe are in support of the PPC. We represent 45,000 battle-born, feminist-strong \nmembers.  \n \nELISA CAFFERATA (Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada; Biotechnology Innovation \nOrganization): \nBoth organizations are in support of S.B. 544. We look forward to participating \nin this important endeavor. \n \nCHELSEA CAPURRO (Health Services Coalition): \nWe are in support of S.B. 544. \n \nALFREDO ALONSO (UnitedHealth Group Inc.): \nWe are in support of S.B. 544. \n \nJOELLE GUTMAN (Washoe County Health District): \nWe are in support of S.B. 544. \n  \nROBIN REEDY (Executive Director, National Alliance on Mental Illness): \nWe are in support of S.B. 544. \n \nHEIDI PARKER (Immunize Nevada): \nWe are here in support of S.B. 544. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 15, 2019 \nPage 8 \n \nJAY PARMER (Association for Accessible Medicines): \nSenate Bill 544 creates the PPC and an opportunity for an important dialogue \nregarding  improving  health  care  delivery  in  Nevada.  Generic  drugs  play  an \nimportant  role  in  the  cost-efficient  delivery  of  health  care  for  Nevadans.  In \n2017,  generic  drug  utilizations  created  a  cost  savings  of  over  $2  billion  in \nNevada. At the same time, generic drug prices have decreased by 6 percent \nevery  year.  With  this  in  mind,  our  industry  is  anxious  to  both  observe  and \nparticipate  in  the  work  of  the  PPC,  especially  the  stated  goal  of  a  better \nunderstanding of prescription drug prices. \n \nJESSICA FERRATO (Nevada Nurses Association): \nWe are in support of S.B. 544. \n \nDAN  MUSGROVE  (Valley  Health  System;  Chiropractic  Physicians'  Board  of \nNevada; WestCare of Nevada): \nAll organizations are in support of S.B. 544. \n \nLINDSAY KNOX (Nevada Orthopaedic Society): \nWe are in support of S.B. 544. \n \nMICHAEL  HACKETT  (Nevada  Primary  Care  Association;  Nevada  Academy  of \nPhysician Assistants; Nevada Public Health Association): \nAll three organizations want to go on record in support of S.B. 544. \n \nHEATHER ARESHENKO: \nI  am  a  mom,  a  patient  with  multiple  sclerosis,  a  speech  pathologist  and  I \nsupport S.B. 544. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSeeing no further testimony, I will close the hearing on S.B. 544 and open the \nhearing on Assembly Bill (A.B.) 151. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 151: Provides for the protection of children who are victims of \ncommercial sexual exploitation. (BDR 38-457) \n \nAssemblywoman Daniele Monroe-Moreno (Assembly District No. 1): \nThis request was based on the work done by the Interim Committee on Child \nWelfare and Juvenile Justice. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 15, 2019 \nPage 9 \n \nNANCY SAITTA (Nevada Coalition to Prevent the Commercial Sexual Exploitation \nof Children): \nI  am  retired  from  the  Nevada  Supreme  Court  and  am  the  Co-chair  for  the \nNevada  Coalition  to  Prevent  the  Commercial  Sexual  Exploitation  of  Children \n(CSEC) Coalition. The CSEC Coalition was created on or about May 31, 2016, \nby Executive Order 2016-14, in response to the Preventing Sex Trafficking and \nStrengthening Families Act of 2014, Public Law 113-118. \n \nNevada is a major destination for those who seek to sexually exploit children. \nNevada ranks tenth in the Nation for the number of human trafficking cases \nreported. That number underestimates the \"real\" number of children who are \ninvolved in this crime. \n \nThe CSEC Coalition spent two years identifying stakeholders, what the needs \nwere for Nevada's children and the best way to reach those children in an \nappropriate  manner.  The  law  needs  to  require  our  child  welfare  system  to \nembrace these child victims in a way that is effective, where services can be \nextended to them and these services will help them turn away from trafficking. \nNevada's statutory scheme does not provide for that. This bill will create an \navenue  for  children  to  come  into  the  system,  be  cared  for,  provided  with \nresources and encouraged to take a path away from human trafficking. \n \nThe  CSEC  Coalition  is  a  cross-section  of  victims,  victim  advocates,  district \nattorneys and resources providers. \n \nROSS  ARMSTRONG  (Administrator,  Division  of  Child  and  Family  Services, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nThe Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, which the United States Congress \npassed, requires child welfare agencies to take reports of children who have \nbeen sex trafficked. Nevada's current statutory scheme does not allow that. \nCurrently, if the Division of Child and Family Services (DCFS) receives a call \nabout  a  child  who  has  been  sexually  trafficked,  and  it  is  \"non-familial \ntrafficking\", which means it is not the parent or guardian who is doing the \nabusing, the DCFS role ends. We get the information and no report or services \nare provided. \n \nAssembly Bill 151 lays the legal foundation for DCFS to take those calls, to \nscreen them appropriately and to get that family access to services. It also \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 15, 2019 \nPage 10 \n \nallows us to contact another state that the child may have come from and get \nthe child back home. \n \nAssembly  Bill  151  lays  out  the  legal  foundation  to  address  this  specific \npopulation. \n \nBRIGID  DUFFY  (Director,  Juvenile  Division,  Clark  County  District  Attorney's \nOffice): \nAssembly Bill 151 recognizes the unique needs of this population of victims. \nThey do not fit in the statutory sections of juvenile justice, child welfare or in \nthe mental health systems. Section 1 will create a new chapter in Title 38 of \nthe Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) dedicated to the identification and treatment \nof children who have been commercially sexually exploited. \n \nSections 2 through 11 are definition sections. \n \nSection 12 creates statutory language that will allow any person to report to a \nchild welfare agency if he or she has reasonable cause to believe that a child is \nbeing exploited. That section is just for the general public. \n \nSection 12, subsection 2, creates a statutory mandate for all current mandated \nreporters who have reasonable cause to believe that a child is being exploited to \nmake a report as soon as reasonably practical, but no less than 24 hours after \nthe  person  knows  or  has  reasonable  cause  to  believe  that  a  child  is  a \ncommercially sexually exploited child. \n \nSection 12, subsection 3 mandates if the alleged perpetrator of the exploitation \nis present with the child, a mandated reporter must not only contact the child \nwelfare agency, but also immediately contact a law enforcement agency. \n \nSection  12,  subsection  4  creates  penalties  for  violating  mandated  reporting \nstatutes. The first offense is a misdemeanor and any subsequent offense is a \ngross misdemeanor. \n \nSection 13 instructs the child welfare agency on what to do when they receive \na report, such as the initial screening, cross reports to law enforcement and if \nthe child is from another jurisdiction, contacting that jurisdiction to cross report \nit. After the initial screening, the agency may also conduct a full assessment. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 15, 2019 \nPage 11 \n \nIf the agency conducts the full assessment pursuant to chapter 432B of NRS \nand no abuse or neglect of the child is identified, the agency itself may conduct \nan assessment of the family and the child to determine if the child is in need of \nservices. Or they may refer out to another agency to conduct that assessment. \n \nIf  the  child  welfare  agency  refers  to  an  outside  provider,  then  there  is  a \nrequirement the provider report back to the child welfare agency if the family or \nchild fails or refuses to participate in the assessment and the services; or if the \nprovider believes there is a serious risk of health or safety to the child. If outside \nproviders are used, and the families are not showing up, there is a mechanism in \nplace to report back to the child welfare agency to determine if more services \nare needed. \n \nSections 14 and 15 address confidentiality of information maintained by the \nchild welfare agency and exceptions for release of that information. \n \nSection  16  is  existing  law  that  provides  for  reports  to  law  enforcement  of \ncommercial sexual exploitation of a child. It also constitutes a report of abuse \nand neglect required by law. \n \nSection  17  is  a  public  records  request  and  makes  these  public  records  not \ndiscoverable. \n \nSections  18  and  19  add  mandated  reporting  requirements  to  certain \nprofessionals. \n \nFor  many  sessions  over  the  past  decade,  this  body  has  been  making  great \nefforts to protect child victims of sex trafficking. Assembly Bill 151 is innovative \nand I believe this is not being done in this Country. This bill creates its own \nstatute to recognize the needs of this population. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs there anyone in support of A.B. 151? \n \nBAILEY BORTOLIN (Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada): \nWe were part of the CSEC Coalition and want to put our thanks on the record in \nsupport of A.B. 151. \n \nJIM HOFFMAN (Nevada Attorneys for Criminal Justice): \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 15, 2019 \nPage 12 \n \nWe are neutral on A.B. 151. We are not opposed to this bill. We have concerns \nover some inadvertent drafting errors. This bill is drafted in a way that makes \nlawyers mandatory reporters. This is a problem for us, because we represent \ndefendants who are charged with commercial sexual exploitation and we have a \nlegal and ethical duty not to report on our clients. \n \nI am talking about section 12, subsection 2 which states, any person who is \nrequired  to  make  a  report  pursuant  to  NRS  432B.220… . Nevada \nRevised Statutes 432B.220 states that except as otherwise provided in NRS \n432B.225,  an  attorney  is  a  mandatory  reporter.  Nevada  Revised \nStatutes 432B.225 states that a lawyer for a person who is accused of abuse \nor neglect of a child is not a mandatory reporter. Again, we have an ethical duty \nto keep confidentiality for our clients. We cannot be required to break that \nconfidentiality. \n \nI am concerned with the bill as drafted, which states an attorney cannot make a \nreport of child abuse or neglect, but they can be required to make a report of \ncommercial sexual exploitation because that is not covered by NRS 432B.225. \n \nSection 12, subsection 3 raises the same issue. If a lawyer knows that the \nalleged perpetrator is or is alleged to be present with the child or something like \nthat, then we have to make a report, we have break our duty of confidentiality. \n \nI think that the exception that exists in NRS 432B.225 is a good exception, but \nI think we need to tweak the bill to make sure defense attorneys are covered. \n \nThe next technical issue is in section 15 and it is about who can  get this \ninformation. Section 15, subsection 2, paragraph (e) states that a court other \nthan a juvenile court can get this information for in-camera inspection only. \nFrom our perspective, the point of that is discovery in a criminal case which is \nfine, but in subsection 2, paragraph (h) it states that a juvenile court can only \nget the information to carry out its legal responsibilities to protect children from \ncommercial sexual exploitation. The problem with that, from our perspective, is \nsometimes  the  defendant  in  a  case  of  commercial  sexual  exploitation  is  a \njuvenile. It is a kid charged with pandering another kid. In that case, the juvenile \ncourt needs to get that information to do discovery. We represent these kids \nwho are charged with pandering. We need access to this information. This is \nanother tweak. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 15, 2019 \nPage 13 \n \nI do not think any of this was intentional; I believe it was inadvertent. These are \ntechnical problems that would impair our duty to our clients and our ability to do \nour jobs. \n \nWe do not oppose the bill, we just need some technical amendments to address \nthese concerns. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe Committee needs your contact information so that we can reach out to \nyou. \n \nMS. SAITTA: \nWe  will  work  on  the  language  with  Mr.  Hoffman.  I  do  believe  these \ntechnicalities were inadvertent. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 151 and open the hearing on A.B. 298. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 298 (1st Reprint): Requires an agency which provides child \nwelfare  services  to  adopt  a  plan  for  the  recruitment  and  retention  of \nfoster homes. (BDR 38-1061) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN SHEA BACKUS (Assembly District No. 37): \nI am a pro bono attorney for the Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada. I have \nthe privilege to represent children who are subject to abuse and neglect. \n \nI want to give the Committee some background behind A.B. 298. It started with \nmy representing, probably one family in particular, who had multiple children. \nDuring my representation, one of the children had gone to a couple different \nschools and was placed far away from where she had been removed from her \nfamily, friends and, more important, her siblings. I tried to figure a way to get \nher to and from community activities such as her church and I saw this as a \nstruggle. I started wondering, where are we recruiting foster families, and are \nthey in the areas where families are being removed or separated? In addition, \nthere are struggles finding foster families to serve and represent large sibling \ngroups or those who have special mental health issues. \n \nWith the help of the Legal Aid Center, we were able to draft A.B. 298. This bill \nhas been amended with the assistance of other stakeholders and the DCFS. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 15, 2019 \nPage 14 \n \nXAVIER PLANTA (Deputy Director, Children's Attorneys Project, Legal Aid Center \nof Southern Nevada): \nI have been a children's attorney for almost ten years. I have worked with the \nDCFS, the district attorney's office and the parents' attorney's office on some \nvery difficult cases. We have had our differences of opinion on trajectory and \noutcome  of  cases  and  various  issues.  However,  we  continue  to  identify \nopportunities to work together to improve our child welfare system. \n \nOne  such  area  of  improvement  is  the  need  for  stronger  recruitment  and \nretention of foster homes. It is always the priority to keep kids safe at home and \navoid putting them in foster care; however, this is not always possible. We do \nnot have a sufficient amount of foster homes to meet the needs of our children. \nAll too often, the child in foster care must choose between attending a new \nschool  near  their  foster  home  or  a  two-hour  bus  ride  to  attend  their  same \nschool. In 2017, there was a change in NRS 388E.105 that allowed children in \nfoster care to remain in their school of origin. However, many children cannot \nbe placed in the same area or in close proximity of their school. This can mean \nlong commutes to and from school. \n \nSeveral years ago, I represented a teenage client who lived in the northwest \npart of Las Vegas, and she was placed in a home across town. While she could \ncontinue to attend the same high school, it meant waking up at 4:30 a.m. to \ncatch  a  5:00  a.m.  bus  to  school.  In  addition,  she  had  to  catch  the  bus \nimmediately  after  school,  so  there  were  no  opportunities  to  participate  in \nafter-school activities or socialize with friends. \n \nWe  have  siblings  who  are  separated  because  there  are  no  homes  that  can \naccommodate sibling groups. This includes siblings of different genders, siblings \nwhere there is a gap in age or large sibling groups of three or more. \n \nWe also have children with special needs who linger in congregate care for \nweeks  and  months  because  there  are  no  homes  that  can  meet  the  child's \nspecial needs. We recently represented a sibling group of four; two of whom \nwere diagnosed with autism. While the younger siblings were placed in a foster \nhome, the two with autism were finally placed six months later. \n \nWe  have  cases  that  involve  children  who  enter  foster  care  speaking  only \nSpanish who are placed in an English only speaking home and we also have \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 15, 2019 \nPage 15 \n \ncases in reverse. Not only are these children removed from their parents, they \nare not able to communicate with the people now caring for them. \n \nAssembly Bill 298 is intended to ensure we have the number of adequate and \nappropriate homes for our children in foster care. It is important for us to see \nwhat  efforts  are  being  made  to  address  this  specific  population.  Equally \nimportant, we need to see the results of the plan. What good is a plan if you are \nnot able to determine if those targets are being achieved? Assembly Bill 298 \npromotes the opportunity to provide feedback for areas of improvement where \nthere continues to be a need. \n \nAssembly  Bill  298  gets  us  away  from  relying  on  congregate  care  such  as \nChild Haven. The federal Family First Prevention Services Act goes into effect in \nOctober 2019. Nevada will not be opting into the Act at that time; however, \nA.B. 298 helps to promote compliance with the Act. Part of the Act seeks to \ncurtail congregate care. Nevada will not be able to rely on congregate care in \nthe future. We are going to need more viable, appropriate foster homes that \nmeet our children's needs. \n \nKARLA RIOS:  \nI am 21 years old. I was put into foster care at the age of 15 on February 14, \n2014, along with my 4 other siblings, Ricardo, Brandon, Angel and Matthew. \nBuilding relationships at a young age is very important. Having kids separated \nfrom friendships and bonds they created is wrong and should be stopped. \n \nI was 15 years old when I finally decided to change my life for the better and \nreported all the scary things that would happen behind closed doors at my \nhouse. \n \nI was put into Child Haven along with my other four siblings. The hardest time \nof my life was keeping strong so all my brothers would not be worried. I was \ntheir mom figure and role model. I knew if they saw me stressed, they would be \nscared and terrified of not knowing why they were just ripped away from their \nmother's arms and saw their parents getting handcuffed and taken away by \npolice. \n \nWeeks passed, and the worst day of my entire life was the moment my siblings \nwere ripped away from me. I felt like I was going crazy. First, it was Matthew \nwho was seven months old, along with Angel, who was six years old at the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 15, 2019 \nPage 16 \n \ntime. I could hear Angel screaming my name. I told Angel in tears to take good \ncare of Matthew and stay strong for him. \n \nI looked at Brandon and knew he was next. In my head I was confused why he \nwas left behind. Why did he not go with Angel and Matthew? Then I knew he \nwas being separated from all of us. I told him to be a strong little boy. Brandon \nwas taken by foster parents. \n \nMy older brother Ricardo and I were placed in WestCare where we lived for \nabout three months with few belongings. During those many months, I had no \ncontact with family, school, or anyone other than my brother Ricardo and the \nfour walls of my room at WestCare. \n \nI was later told I would be able to return to school and that was the best news I \nhad heard in so many days. I was happy to get back to a regular routine. Going \nback to see all of my friends and teachers was like a little kid being handed a \npiece of candy. Ricardo and I had to wake up extra early to catch the bus, but \nwe were excited to get back to school. When I arrived at my high school there \nwere tears running down my face as I ran to my teacher Ms. Erica. She would \nlater become my foster mom. \n \nWith the events going on at home, school was my sanctuary. I wanted to stay \naway from my WestCare home. Being able to continue my education at my high \nschool where all the kids that I grew bonds with for many years, made my life \njust a bit easier. If it was not for these bonds I created, or if I had changed \nschools, life would have been devastating. \n \nI was always sad and disappointed to go back to WestCare and all I wanted to \ndo  was stay at school and never have to leave. This led  me to join every \nextra-curricular activity and sport I could think of, so I would not have to go \nback to WestCare. I even stayed after school to do homework with teachers \nand used that as an excuse to not go home. I grew to have so much love for my \nschool and it became a safe place for me. If I was moved to another school, I \nwould  have  lost  my  safe  place  and  have  nowhere  to  go.  I  became \nVice President of my school, I ran track and cross country, my grades were \namazing and I was very proud of the events occurring in my life. My grade point \naverage was 3.8 to 4.0 and I graduated 8th in my high school class and was \nthe 2015 prom queen. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 15, 2019 \nPage 17 \n \nEventually my brother Ricardo and I were placed with one of my high school \nteachers. We were able to stay in the same area. I was able to shop at the \nsame stores, visit the same parks and go out with my friends to the same \nhangout spots. My life was going in the right direction. I felt like I wanted to \npush harder and achieve all the goals I now had for the future. \n \nI had the luck of being placed with amazing foster parents; however, my brother \nBrandon did not have much luck. Brandon was only ten when he was placed in \nfoster care. At that time, he was the most frightened out of all of us. He started \nout with one foster mom, he got moved to another, then another, and I lost \ntrack of how many. In the end, he was not doing well mentally or physically. He \nwent to the hospital at least three times during the time frame with his foster \nparents. I would hear stories: he broke a window; he broke his leg; he broke his \narm and the stories continued. Not only was Brandon affected by having to go \nto new schools, but he was also really affected by being separated from his \nsiblings. Brandon became antisocial and his grades dropped at all his schools. \n \nEventually, three of my siblings went back home with our mom. Brandon told \nme  there  was  a  point  with  all  the  moving  where  he  stopped  having  any \nencouragement to build any more relationships with anyone. He told me he was \nconfused all the time on why he could not be with his siblings. He explained to \nme that I had Ricardo, Matthew had Angel, while he had no one. He was sad \nwhen he left his first school and had to start all over again. Brandon used to be \nsmart and talented in school. I remember he brought home straight A and B \ngrades and now his grades are D and F \n.  He  is  currently  homeschooled  because  he  does  not  know  how  to  build \nrelationships with his peers and he does not feel comfortable attending school. \n \nBased on my experience in foster care, the thing that I realized is the importance \nof staying in the same community and having the same friends, surroundings \nand school. This means a lot in one's life. Being able to stay with your siblings, \nstay with people you love and want to protect you is comforting when going \nthrough a hard and unfamiliar time. I am here today because I lived firsthand \ninside a foster care system and saw good, but also saw how much damage it \ncan  do  to  kids.  I  want  to  help  make  a  change  so  others  will  not  have  to \nexperience what my siblings and I had to go through. Others should not have to \nbe separated, change schools and leave the norms of their community. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 15, 2019 \nPage 18 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThank you, Ms. Rios, that was a powerful testimony. I want you to know you \nare making an amazing difference by being here telling your personal story. \nThere is no way for us to learn about these issues better than what you just did. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN BACKUS: \nI want to add that we have been given a proposed amendment (Exhibit D). In \nsupport testimony, you will hear more about it from the Nevada Psychiatric \nAssociation. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs there anyone in support on A.B. 298? \n \nLEA CARTWRIGHT (Nevada Psychiatric Association): \nThe proposed amendment requests four data points be reported by the DCFS. I \nwill read those four data points in Exhibit D. This will give us information as to \nwhy kids are going out-of-state and what we can do better here in Nevada. \n \nHELEN FOLEY (FirstMed): \nFirstMed is a federally qualified health clinic in southern Nevada. We support \nA.B. 298 and we especially support the proposed amendment. What I like about \nthe amendment is it does not specifically address just foster care children. There \nare many children who are involved in the juvenile justice system in southern \nNevada. These children are sent out-of-state for care. Many times parents just \ncannot deal with the child. It can be difficult when you want to re-unite that \nfamily. If the child is sent out-of-state, many times they get lost and the family \nunit does not recover. \n \nMR. ARMSTRONG: \nWe are neutral on A.B. 298. We had concerns over the first version of the bill \nand we want to confirm that with the amended version, the fiscal note is gone. \nWe have no issues with the proposed amendment. \n \nMay is National Foster Care month. I want to thank all of our foster care parents \nin Nevada. We have a shortage of foster care parents and this bill can help us \nmove the needle. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 15, 2019 \nPage 19 \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nI want to thank Ms. Rios for her testimony. My coach took me in for a year \nwhen we had family problems. I was able to stay in the same high school. I \nthink I turned out alright; however, my brother went to a foster care home \noutside of his normal area and I believe that led to a lot of problems for him.

This is the clean-up language. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI did a little research and hematopoietic cell transplants is one of the treatments \nused in medically necessary cases. I do not know if this treatment was taken \ninto consideration. \n \nTOM CLARK (Nevada Association of Health Plans): \nWe did not get into the specifics as far as that particular type of treatment. We \nknow that treatment is available and much of it is still under study. Medically \nnecessary  is  described  in  federal  and  state  statutes.  If  that  treatment  is  a \nmedically necessary service and can be provided to these patients, my clients \nunderstand that would be encompassed by this piece of legislation. A lot of \nwhat we discussed were the prescription drugs and supplements to ensure the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 15, 2019 \nPage 23 \n \ntransition of a child with sickle cell to adulthood would be able to maintain a \ncontinuity of care. That is important, that is in this bill, and we support it. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWe are talking about the transplantation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor \ncells from any source bone marrow. You are saying \"yes\" everyone understood \nthat? \n \nMR. CLARK: \nThat particular procedure was not discussed in relationship to this bill. What \nwas discussed was what is medically necessary as prescribed by the physician \nof that patient. I cannot specifically discuss that procedure, but I can ask. I \nthink we had enough people looking at this bill, so if it was an issue, I think it \nwould have been discussed. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI am going to vote for A.B. 254 today, but I would like Mr. Clark to answer this \nquestion before this bill comes for a vote on the Senate Floor. \n \nMR. CLARK: \nI  saw  the  documentary  on  that  particular  procedure  and  it  is  really  quite \namazing. I do not know how far it has gone in its testing procedure. It does give \na glimmer of hope because sickle cell is a horrific disease.

(BDR 38-457) \n \nMS. COMLOSSY: \nI will read the summary of the bill and amendments from the work session \ndocument (Exhibit D). \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nThe attorney who testified during the hearing on this bill was worried about \nconflicting information. Does this bill clarify their concerns? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nMy understanding is that the bill sponsor met with the gentleman who brought \nthe concerns forward; this is the language they agreed on. \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nThank you. However, the concern I wanted to ensure we are addressing is as \nattorneys,  they  may  sometimes  be  conflicted  by  listening  to  their  client \nprotecting their confidentiality and then having to report a situation. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 20, 2019 \nPage 3 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThis language covers that concern. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIt goes against my grain having someone who says I did something to this child, \nand I have an attorney who does not have to report anything. The attorney \nknows that someone did something to a child and is not obligated to save the \nchild. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will ask Mr. Ross Armstrong to come to the table to help us with this and ask \nour legal counsel to be prepared to answer any questions if necessary. We are \nwell  within  the  pre-established  constitutional  rights  when  you  talk  about \nsomeone who is being defended by an attorney in a criminal case. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIf the attorney is the only person finding out for the first time that a child is \nbeing sexually exploited, what do we do with the child? We have a child who is \nbeing sexually exploited, which the attorney knows about but is in no way \nobligated to protect that child. \n \nIf I were going to be artful about it, the attorney could say, with a veil of \nconfidentiality, someone needs to protect the child. The child is not protected, \nbecause the person exploiting the child is safe under attorney-client privilege. \n \nROSS  ARMSTRONG  (Administrator,  Division  of  Child  and  Family  Services, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nThere were concerns raised at the hearing for A.B. 151. When you have an \nattorney  who  has  a  client  who  is  alleged  to  have  committed  the  sexual \nexploitation of a child, there is attorney-client privilege that is well established to \nprotect the individual. There is still an obligation for attorneys to report if they \nknow  there  is  a  crime  that  is  about  to  occur.  They  would  be  relieved  of \nconfidentiality in that matter if it meets that threshold. \n \nThere was a section in the child abuse and neglect statutes we took most of the \nconfidentiality language from but was inadvertently left out when we drafted \nthe bill. Section 12.5 of the amendment mirrors the language in the child abuse \nand neglect statutes that do not create a situation for the attorney in which \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 20, 2019 \nPage 4 \n \nthey would be violating their ethical responsibilities to maintain confidentiality. \nAt the same time, it would allow for reporting in certain circumstances. \n \nSENTOR HARDY: \nI believe there is an order to things. This amendment seems to allow an abuser \nto go to an attorney and say I did this, but now it is confidential, so I am off the \nhook  unless  someone  else  says  this  child  has  been  abused.  It  is  against \neverything I believe to say that there is a child at risk and I am going to let that \nchild continue to be at risk without doing something. That is not right. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI  think  that  particular  conundrum  has  been  mitigated  when  you  look  at \nsection 12.5,  subsection  2,  paragraphs  (a)  and  (b)  in  the  work  session \ndocument. It states \"nothing in this section shall be construed as relieving an \nattorney from … except as otherwise provided in subsection 1 … complying \nwith any ethical duties of attorneys\". We may want to confirm with legal on \nthis. \n \nI  think  this  section  is  actually  addressing  the  issue  that  Senator  Hardy  is \nconcerned about with respect to an attorney finding out a child is being sexually \nexploited. The client, who is actually the exploiter, would tie the hands of the \nattorney. I believe there are provisions for this. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThere is an issue we are trying to balance here which is the protection of the \nchild balanced by the attorney-client privilege in a criminal case. \n \nERIC ROBBINS (Committee Counsel): \nAs Senator Spearman noted, in section 12.5, subsection 2, paragraph (b) it \nstates \"Nothing in this section shall be construed as relieving an attorney from \n… Complying with any ethical duties of an attorney as set forth in the Rules of \nProfessional Conduct\". \n \nNevada Rules of Professional Conduct, section 1.6(a) is the confidentiality rule \nand states: \n \nA lawyer shall not reveal information relating to the representation \nof a client unless the client gives informed consent, the disclosure \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 20, 2019 \nPage 5 \n \nis impliedly authorized in order to carry out the representation, or \nthe disclosure is permitted by paragraphs (b) and (d). \n \nParagraph (d) states: \n \nA lawyer shall reveal information relating to the representation of a \nclient to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary to \nprevent a criminal act that the lawyer believes is likely to result in \nreasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm. \n \nI  believe  you  could  certainly  argue  that  commercial  sexual  exploitation  is \nreasonably likely to result in substantial bodily harm. In that case, if the child is \nstill being commercially sexually exploited, the attorney would have a duty to \nreveal that information to the extent necessary to protect the child. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nAs we well know, there is more than bodily harm that takes place. When we \nconsider the ramifications that are ongoing, which are mental and emotional \nthat are not bodily and are not in danger of death, we have a loophole. We have \nto make sure we protect the child. I am not sure paragraph (d) convinces me \nthat we have protected the child. \n \nAgain, it goes to the order of things. If the attorney is the first one who finds \nout about this, I have to question the motive of the perpetrator to go to the \nattorney so no one else can find out. What happens if someone else finds out \nand the perpetrator goes to the attorney and is protected by confidentiality? The \nattorney does not have an obligation to protect the child unless bodily harm or \ndeath happens. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI would like to invite the sponsor of the bill to be part of this conversation. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN DANIELE MONROE-MORENO (Assembly District No. 1): \nI chaired the Interim Committee on Child Welfare and Juvenile Justice. I have \nworked in law enforcement for almost 30 years, and I have never met anyone \nwho went to an attorney and told them they had committed a crime. What this \nbill would address is if someone has knowledge of a crime being committed and \nthis person is charged or about to be charged and they hire an attorney. At least \n98 percent of the time, the child has been removed from the situation. The \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 20, 2019 \nPage 6 \n \nconversation  that  is  happening  is  between  that  suspect  who  is  probably  in \ncustody, and his attorney, and that is already protected attorney-client privilege. \nThe attorney cannot say anything about that situation unless compelled by the \ncourts. The child is already in a protective state at this point. There is nothing in \nthis bill or the amendment as written that speaks to a person telling an attorney \nI committed a crime and I want you to protect me. In my 30 years of experience \nin law enforcement, I have never seen that happen. \n \nThis bill covers when someone has been suspected of committing that crime. \nThey are probably in the custody of police and in jail. The child is put in a \nprotective situation whether it is with Child Protective Services or in a foster \nhome. \n \nAs the bill was originally written, we were forcing the attorney who testified, or \nany attorney, to disclose what he or she got out of the conversation with the \nsuspect who is in custody. That is the intent of this bill. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI like the intent; I do not trust people who break laws and do things to children. \nLet us imagine a scenario where you happen to be an attorney and are at a \nfriend's house who shows you child pornography they have. You, the attorney, \nknow this is not legal. Your friend says you are my attorney now, and you \ncannot say anything. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI  think  this  is  a  legal  question.  I  would  like  to  defer  to  our  legal  counsel \nspecifically pointing to the language in the amendment as to what is important \nis not just intent, but what it actually states. \n \nI am looking at section 12.5, which states: \n \n… an attorney shall not make a report of the commercial sexual \nexploitation of a child if the attorney acquired knowledge of the \ncommercial  sexual  exploitation  from  a  client  during  a  privileged \ncommunication  if  the  client  has  been  or  may  be  accused  of \ncommitting the commercial sexual exploitation. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 20, 2019 \nPage 7 \n \nThis is the exemption, when an attorney shall not report a situation, and it has \nto be a client, not just a friend. It has to be privileged communication, not just a \ncasual conversation with their attorney and not just any attorney. \n \nTo me, the moment that attorney finds out someone has done something to a \nchild and knows the person may or may not have been accused, all three of \nthese boxes have to be checked in order to be exempted from having to report \nthe situation. Otherwise, the way this is written they would have to report a \nsituation, correct? \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nThat is correct. All three boxes would have to be checked. It is important to \nnote that you do not have representation just because someone comes to an \nattorney and states they have committed a crime. The attorney must agree to \nbe that person's attorney. Someone could not avoid the reporting obligation just \nby going to an attorney they know and telling them they have committed a \ncrime.  The  attorney  would  have  to  agree  to  represent  them  prior  to  the \ncommunication happening. There would have to be a previous attorney-client \nrelationship formed before the communication happened for it to be a privileged \ncommunication. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIf you read the amendment, it states \"or may be accused of committing the \ncommercial sexual exploitation\"; that is a \"may.\" It is not a \"has been,\" but a \n\"may\" be accused. Let us say I have spoken with an attorney, asked them to be \nmy attorney, and he says yes. I tell him something I know about a situation and \nnow the attorney cannot say anything to anyone else about what I told him. I \nhave established attorney-client privilege and fortunately have not been in a \nposition  where  I  may  be  accused  of  a  crime,  but  I  have  established  a \nrelationship with an attorney. It does not take a written contract. It simply \nstates will you represent me, yes I will be your attorney, and it is done. \n \nI understand the intent and that 99.9 percent of the time someone has been \naccused and everyone knows they have been accused. Now we are going to \nrepresent you for your accusation that did not come to the attorney first, but \nthrough someone else. If it comes to the attorney first, and the attorney's hands \nare tied because we allow them to be tied, we still have a vulnerable child who \nneeds protection. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 20, 2019 \nPage 8 \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nAnother exception in Rule 1.6 that may be applicable here is that an attorney is \nauthorized to reveal information relating to the representation of a client in order \nto prevent a client from committing a criminal or fraudulent act in furtherance of \nwhich the client has used or is using the attorney's services. If the client goes \nto the attorney with the express intent of furthering and concealing ongoing \ncommercial  sexual  exploitation,  it  seems  that  would  be  covered  by  that \nexception to the confidentiality requirement. \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nYou are saying that, I as an individual who may have committed a crime, can go \nto an attorney and disclose this crime and have some shield of protection. I can \ncontinue to act in that manner and commit that crime over and over again. As \nlong as I confess to an attorney, I am good regardless of whatever evidence or \nethical standards the attorney has. \n \nI also understood you to say that within ethical standards the attorney would \nhave to report the situation. \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nThe attorney would be required to say something if the attorney believes the \ncriminal action is likely to result in reasonably certain death or substantial bodily \nharm,  which  I  believe  would  generally  be  the  case  for  commercial  sexual \nexploitation.  Even  if  the  attorney  did  not  feel  those  things  were  true,  the \nattorney would be authorized to disclose to prevent the client from committing \nthe commercial sexual exploitation if the client is using the attorney's services \nto further that. If the whole purpose of the client going to the attorney is to help \nhim conceal what the client has been doing, the attorney would be authorized to \nmake a report. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWhat I hear from this conversation is that the likelihood of this happening is \nprobably rare, as the vast majority of people speaking with an attorney are \nunder some sort of likelihood that they will be accused of a crime. \n \nI  hear  Senator  Hardy's  concern.  I  think  the  concept  here  was  mandatory \nreporting, which was the original concept of the bill. The mandatory reporting \npiece under the Rules of Professional Conduct 1.6 is the attorney must report it \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 20, 2019 \nPage 9 \n \nif they believe there is a risk of bodily harm or death moving forward. Is that \ncorrect? \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nThat is correct. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe have two weeks to review this; we have a Committee member who is \nconcerned. I would like to remove this from work session today and have one \nmore conversation with our legal counsel, giving them a little more time to \nreview the bill and amendment to see if there is a way to strengthen this in \nsome way to point to Rule 1.6. Cases of commercial sexual exploitation of \nchildren can be called out specifically as a mandatory reporting within those \nexceptions. \n \nI would like to see this tightened up a little bit more. The case has been well \nmade that this would be a rare exception, but I also understand the concern that \nif there is a child at risk, we want to ensure we are doing everything we can to \ntake care of that child. \n \nWe will remove this from work session and see if we can get more clarity on \nreal-world scenarios about how this might take place and if there is any way for \nus to put a little more pressure on the reporting side. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRemainder of page intentionally left blank; signature page to follow.   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 20, 2019 \nPage 10 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSeeing no further business, we are adjourned at 5:38 p.m. \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nVickie Polzien, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 20, 2019 \nPage 11 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nExhibit / \nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \n# of pages \n  A  1    Agenda \n  B  1    Attendance Roster \nS.B. 544  C  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nA.B. 151  D  2  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \n ", "4": "\nMINUTES OF THE  \nSENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n \nEightieth Session \nMay 22, 2019 \n \n \nThe Senate Committee on Health and Human Services was called to order by \nChair Julia Ratti at 2:50 p.m. on Wednesday, May 22, 2019, in Room 2135 of \nthe  Legislative  Building,  Carson City,  Nevada.

Hardy \nSenator Scott Hammond \n \nSTAFF MEMBERS PRESENT: \n \nMegan Comlossy, Committee Policy Analyst \nEric Robbins, Committee Counsel \nMichelle Hamilton, Committee Secretary \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will open with the work session on Assembly Bill (A.B. 151). \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 151: Provides for the protection of children who are victims of \ncommercial sexual exploitation. (BDR 38-457) \n \nMEGAN COMLOSSY (Committee Policy Analyst): \nI will read the summary of the bill and amendments from the work session \ndocument (Exhibit C). \n \nERIC ROBBINS (Committee Counsel): \nThe Nevada Rules of Professional Conduct prescribe the ethical responsibilities \nof lawyers in this State. Nevada Rule of Professional Conduct 1.6 generally \nprohibits a lawyer from revealing information relating to the representation of a \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 22, 2019 \nPage 2 \n \nclient unless the client consents to the disclosure or the disclosure is impliedly \nauthorized in order to carry out the representation. \n \nThe policy reason behind this rule is that people have a right to counsel under \nthe Constitution. In order for them to have effective representation, they might \nneed  to  discuss  incriminating  information  with  their  counsel  without  being \ndeterred from doing so by risking the counsel would go to authorities with that \ninformation.  This  requirement  could  be  read  to  be  in  conflict  with  the \nrequirements  of  A.B. 151  that  label  attorneys  as  mandatory  reporters  of \ncommercial child sexual exploitation. \n \nHowever, Rule 1.6 requires a lawyer to reveal such information to the extent \nthe lawyer reasonably believes necessary to prevent a criminal act which the \nlawyer  believes  is  likely  to  result  in  reasonably  certain  death  or  substantial \nbodily harm. \n \nRule 1.6 additionally authorizes a lawyer to reveal information relating to the \nrepresentation of a client when necessary to prevent reasonably certain death or \nsubstantial bodily harm not resulting from a criminal act, or to prevent, mitigate \nor rectify the consequences of a client's criminal act in the commission of which \nthe lawyer's services have been or are being used. \n \nThe  proposed  amendment  prohibits  a  lawyer  from  making  a  report  of  the \ncommercial  sexual  exploitation  of  a  child  when  the  report  constitutes  a \nprohibited disclosure under Rule 1.6. This proposed amendment also clarifies \nthat a lawyer is required to make such a report where such reporting is not \nprohibited by Rule 1.6. \n \nIn  doing  so,  the  proposed  amendment  specifically  addresses  reporting  the \ncommercial sexual exploitation of a child where necessary to prevent further sex \ntrafficking or sexual abuse. \n \nThe  comments  a  similar  provision  of  the  Restatement  (Third)  of  the  Law \nGoverning Lawyers, a uniform statement of common law governing lawyers \nproduced by the American Law Institute, provide that \"Serious Bodily Harm \nwithin the meaning of the Section includes … the consequences of events such \nas … child sexual abuse.\" \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 22, 2019 \nPage 3 \n \nTherefore,  if  Nevada  Rule  of  Professional  Conduct  1.6  is  interpreted  in \naccordance  with  the  Restatement,  an  attorney  has  a  duty  to  disclose \ninformation relating to the representation of a client to the extent necessary to \nprevent the sexual abuse of children. \n \nThe proposed amendment codifies this interpretation by requiring an attorney to \nreport  the  commercial  sexual  exploitation  of  a  child  to  the  extent  that  the \nattorney reasonably believes necessary to prevent the further sex trafficking or \nsexual abuse of the child. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will entertain a motion on A.B. 151. \n \nSENATOR HARDY MOTIONED TO AMEND AND DO PASS AS AMENDED \nA.B. 151. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nMOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRemainder of page intentionally left blank; signature page to follow.   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 22, 2019 \nPage 4 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSeeing no further business, we are adjourned at 2:57 p.m. \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nVickie Polzien, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 22, 2019 \nPage 5 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nExhibit / \nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \n# of pages \n  A  1    Agenda \n  B  1    Attendance Roster \nA.B. 151  C  2  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \n ", "5": "\nMINUTES OF THE  \nSENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n \nEightieth Session \nMay 29, 2019 \n \n \nThe Senate Committee on Health and Human Services was called to order by \nChair Julia Ratti at 8:01 p.m. on Wednesday, May 29, 2019, in Room 2135 of \nthe  Legislative  Building,  Carson City,  Nevada.

(BDR 38-1204) \n \nSUZANNE BIERMAN (Administrator, Division of Health Care Financing and Policy, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nI will be presenting A.B. 494 for your consideration. Since 2014, the Board of \nTrustees of the Fund for Hospital Care to Indigent Persons has transferred funds \nto Medicaid as the nonfederal share of a supplemental payment to hospitals. \nThis  supplemental  payment  is  called  the  Hospital  Indigent  Fund  or  Indigent \nAccident Fund Supplemental Payment program. The purpose of this Fund is to \npreserve and increase access to inpatient services for needy Nevadans. Since \nthis program began, the Hospital Indigent Fund supplemental payment total has \nincreased  significantly.  This  has,  in  turn,  caused  a  decrease  in  the  State's \nsavings generated in other supplemental payment programs. \n \nThe language in A.B. 494 allows the Board of Trustees for the Fund to make a \nvoluntary contribution to Medicaid to offset the decrease in savings from other \nprograms. This prevents a negative impact on Medicaid funding while at the \nsame  time  allowing  the  Hospital  Indigent  Fund  or  Indigent  Accident  Fund \nSupplemental Payment program to grow and maximize federal matching funds \nfor hospital reimbursements. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 494 and open the hearing on A.B. 234. \n \nASSEMBLY  BILL  234  (2nd  Reprint):  Makes  various  changes  relating  to  the \nProgram for Child Care and Development. (BDR 38-305) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN DANIELE MONROE-MORENO (Assembly District No. 1): \nI  am  here  to  present  A.B.  234  for  your  consideration.  I  am  going  to  let \nMr. Jared Busker walk you through the bill. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 29, 2019 \nPage 3 \n \nJARED BUSKER (Children's Advocacy Alliance): \nAssembly Bill 234 looks at our Child Care Subsidy Program. In its current form, \nit looks at two different parts of the Program. The first requires the Program for \nChild Care and Development, also known as the Child Care Subsidy Program, to \ninclude measures to increase the availability of child care for children with a \ndisability. \n \nThese measures may include an enhanced rate of reimbursement for child care \nprovided to a child with a disability by a provider that receives any training or \ntechnical assistance deemed appropriate by the Director for the care of the \nchild.  That  could  be  an  increase  to  the  Child  Care  Subsidy  Program \nreimbursement rate; the actual rate a child care provider would be paid for \nserving a child. \n \nThe measures may also include providing other economic resources for child \ncare.  This  could  be  one-time  grants  or  stipends  for  a  provider  to  purchase \nneeded equipment to service children at their center, or scholarships for an \nindividual to attend a conference or receive additional training. \n \nThey can also provide supplemental services to a childcare facility or persons \nwho provide child care for the purpose of increasing access to child care for \nchildren with disabilities. These could include wraparound services to a child, or \nthe State paying for a specialist to go to a childcare center. \n \nAdditionally, the bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services \n(DHHS) to submit a report to the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for \ntransmittal to the Legislative Committee on Child Welfare and Juvenile Justice. \nThis  report  will  include  a  description  of  the  measures  they  have  taken  to \nincrease access for children with disabilities, and any data concerning how the \nDHHS has worked to increase that access. \n \nThe second part of the bill requires the State, as funding is available, to provide \nchildcare assistance to a child of a parent who is enrolled in an educational or \nvocational  program  that  awards  a  degree  or  certificate  at  a  post-secondary \neducational institution, as long as that parent is otherwise eligible for a childcare \nsubsidy. \n \nWe met with some parents who have gone through the steps to return to school \nby completing exams, looking into financial aid and completing the application \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 29, 2019 \nPage 4 \n \nprocess. After returning to school, they realize they can no longer work full \ntime; therefore, they are no longer eligible for a childcare subsidy. These parents \ntherefore have decided to forgo returning to school and have continued to work \nand receive subsidy assistance. The goal for this part of the bill is to help that \nspecific population wanting to return to school so they can continue to receive \nchildcare subsidy assistance while enrolled. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIf available, where will we get this money? Will it come from accepting gifts, \ngrants or donations? \n \nMR. BUSKER: \nThe majority of our funds for childcare subsidy programs come from the Child \nCare and Development Block Grant. This is a federal grant the State receives. \nWe  do  put  in  a  small  State  match  of  approximately  $4  million.  There  are \nindividuals here who may be able to confirm this number if necessary. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nAre you looking for additional money from the State? \n \nMR. BUSKER: \nWe are not looking for an increase in appropriation from the State at this time. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThis Session we have talked about children who are deaf and blind, which is \ncertainly a disability. Is there anything in A.B. 234 that would help the parents \nof children who have those challenges access this program? \n \nThe reason for my question is that we have parents who have spoken about \nchildren who are deaf not being able to get into day care. They were limited in \nwhat they can do to further their careers or train for another job. \n \nNOVA  MURRAY  (Deputy  Administrator,  Division  of  Welfare  and  Supportive \nServices, Department of Health and Human Services): \nThe purpose here is to increase access to care for those children with any type \nof disability. The program is currently doing that, and we are working with a \nfacility for blind children now. There is no money involved. This is a way for us \nto keep our policies in the Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) versus out of NRS. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 29, 2019 \nPage 5 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIs there a fiscal note? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN MONROE-MORENO: \nWith  the  amendments  made  for  the  Second  Reprint  the  fiscal  note  was \nremoved. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nTo clarify, this bill asks that the DHHS have a plan, and policies they currently \nuse get codified in that plan. It requires reporting be done to know we have a \nfocused effort ensuring children with disabilities, who are being served primarily \nby the federal Childcare Subsidy Program, are getting those services. Through \nthat reporting process, we may be able to identify barriers or places where in \nfuture Legislative Sessions there would be an opportunity to intervene to ensure \nwe are truly serving the population the way they need to be served. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN MONROE-MORENO: \nThat is correct. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 234 and open the hearing on A.B. 498. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 498 (1st Reprint): Revises provisions relating to fictive kin \ncaregivers. (BDR 38-452) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN MONROE-MORENO: \nI am here to present A.B. 498 for your consideration. During the Interim, I had \nthe honor to serve as Chair of our Child Welfare and Juvenile Justice Interim \nCommittee. The Children's Advocacy Alliance presented information regarding \nfictive kin providers. Fictive kin providers are individuals who have a family-like \ntie to a child, and are the preferred placement for a child when a blood relative \nis unable or unwilling to provide care for a child. These placements allow a child \nto grow to adulthood in a family environment and maintain connections to their \nfamily, community and their identity. \n \nKinship caregivers differ from foster parents as they are unlicensed when they \nfirst  accept  children  into  their  home.  As  they  are  unlicensed,  they  are  not \nentitled  to  the  financial  support  that  a  non-kin  foster  parent  receives.  Most \nkinship caregivers having a child placed in their care can become financially \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 29, 2019 \nPage 6 \n \nburdened. Many of these caregivers are retired and living on fixed incomes. \nMore than one-third are already living at or below the poverty line, and some \nmay be in poor health. This has caused some fictive kin providers to have a \ndeclined placement and/or request for the child to be placed elsewhere within \nmonths after taking them into their care. \n \nAssembly  Bill  498  helps  offset  the  financial  burden  by  allowing  fictive  kin \nproviders to receive some assistance in providing care. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe are putting a piece into the State Plan that makes it clear that the provision \nto provide assistance for fictive kin is allowed. Are we anticipating this will \nbring additional resources? How are we getting to that place and be able to \naccommodate it within our current Temporary Assistance for Needy Families \n(TANF) program? Where does the resource for helping these additional families \ncome from? \n \nMR. BUSKER: \nAs the bill was written, the DHHS did not add a fiscal note. We believe they are \nusing their current resources to cover fictive kin providers. \n \nLISA  SWEARINGEN  (Chief,  Eligibility  and  Payments,  Division  of  Welfare  and \nSupportive Services, Department of Health and Human Services): \nThe  DHHS  did  add  a  fiscal  note  of  $834,000  because  to  implement  this \nprogram, we would need a new aid code to track it. However, this is all funded \n100 percent out of the TANF block grant. There is no money out of the general \nfund being used. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs the TANF block grant a fixed dollar amount? Does this bump other families \noff of TANF in order to accommodate these families or bring down more federal \nmoney? \n \nMS. SWEARINGEN: \nIt will not affect our current caseload. We have enough money in reserves to \ncover this and it would not affect any of those families. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nHow would the $834,000 be used? \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 29, 2019 \nPage 7 \n \nMS. SWEARINGEN: \nThat would be used for development time, requirements writing, the building of \nthe system within our eligibility system and developing a new aid code. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nAre we developing that system now, and if so, is that why it does not count \ntoward this program? \n \nMS. SWEARINGEN: \nNo. We would not develop that system if we did not implement the fictive kin \nprogram. \n \nMS. SWEARINGEN: \nThat money would sit in our federal block grant to be used for TANF programs. \n \nSTEVE  FISHER  (Administrator,  Division  of  Welfare  and  Supportive  Services, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nWhen times are good, the economy is doing well and the unemployment rate is \ndown, we build up a reserve in our TANF block grant funds. When the economy \nturns at some point and the unemployment rate goes up and families need cash \nassistance, we dip into those reserves. Today, we have plenty of reserves to \ncover the caseload which is about 400 children. \n \nMS. SWEARINGEN: \nIn 2018, 441 children were covered under the fictive kin program. \n \nMR. FISHER: \nWe  are  looking  at  a  relatively  small  population,  adding  approximately \n400 children to the program. We are able to handle that today based on the \nsignificant amount of reserves we have. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nSo this is a good time to do it while we have the reserves. \n \nMR. FISHER: \nThat is correct. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 29, 2019 \nPage 8 \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN MONROE-MORENO: \nI  received  an  appropriation  to  hire  a  consultant  to  work  with  the  Interim \nCommittee on Child Welfare and Juvenile Justice for the sole purpose of seeing \nwhat other states are doing to bring in more federal grant money. As you know, \nNevada is at the bottom end of this. \n \nLeaders in our State are going to conferences and hearing what other states are \ndoing that are creative ways for obtaining more federal grant money for child \nwelfare and juvenile justice. Once that is approved and we get the consultant \nhired, the Interim Committee will go to work to replace funds that will generate \nadditional funds for our State. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs the TANF block grant based on our population, or does it grow or shrink \nbased on economic factors? For the clients you serve, it is an entitlement, and if \nthey meet the minimum qualifications, they get the money. \n \nMR. FISHER: \nWe  get  a  specific  dollar  amount  each  year.  It  does  not  change  based  on \npopulation; it is a block grant. For example, we may get $50 million each year \nand we have to serve the population within that amount. \n \nAnd yes, if the clients meet the qualifications, they receive the money. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIf we do hit a tough economy and have additional need, we will have added \n441 children who will still have this entitlement. Have we ever gotten to a point \nwhere we ran out of reserves and had to figure out how to limit eligibility? \n \nMR. FISHER: \nI have never seen us run out of reserves. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nHave we ever had to limit eligibility or decrease the benefit? \n \nMR. FISHER: \nWe would have to tighten our eligibility to perhaps limit the population that is \ncoming into the program should we run out of reserves. We could reduce the \nbenefit amount; that would be an option. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 29, 2019 \nPage 9 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAs a sense of scale or scope, it is approximately 400 children. Roughly how \nmany children are on the TANF program? Are we increasing the population by \n1 percent or a larger percentage? \n \nMR. FISHER: \nI am unsure of the caseload number at this time. \n \nMS. SWEARENGIN: \nI  am  unsure  of  the  number  as  well,  but  can  get  back  to  you  with  the \ninformation. \n \nMR. FISHER: \nOf those 400 children, we are not sure how many will actually be eligible for \nthe TANF program. It could be 400 or less. Currently, there are approximately \n26,000 who are on the TANF program. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAs a matter of scale, this is a very small bump in expanding the eligibility to \nTANF. \n \nMR. FISHER: \nThat is correct. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe have letters of testimony in support of A.B. 498 from Algie Elzy (Exhibit C), \nAlison  Caliendo  (Exhibit  D),  Kat  Case  (Exhibit  E),  Mary  Zambito  (Exhibit  F), \nHeather Ribarsky (Exhibit G) and Samantha R.

(BDR 38-544) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN DINA NEAL (Assembly District No. 7): \nThis bill came about, because I decided to get involved in oral health. I wanted \nto narrow my scope and chose diabetes. Diabetes is the 7th leading cause of \ndeath  in  the  United  States,  the  8th  leading  cause  of  death  in  Nevada  and \n14 percent of Nevada's Medicaid adult population has received a diagnoses of \neither type 1 or type 2 diabetes. There is a lot of research that links diabetes to \nperiodontal disease. This bill creates a demonstration project within the State \nthat will look at this issue. After the demonstration project is complete, we can \ninclude this in the State Plan if there is appropriate funding. \n \nANTONINA  CAPURRO  (State  Dental  Health  Officer,  Division  of  Public  and \nBehavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services): \nThis legislation will improve the health of Nevada's underserved and vulnerable \npopulation. Under the current Medicaid system in Nevada, dental services for \nnon-pregnant adults are limited to dental extractions and removable prosthesis, \nwhich means partials and full dentures. \n \nThis  system  exists  despite  the  fact  there  is  well-documented  research  that \nrecognizes oral health is essential and integral to overall health. Oral health is \nmuch more than just healthy teeth. Oral health is not only being free of tooth \ndecay and gum disease, but it also means being free of chronic oral pain, oral \ncancers and other conditions that affect the mouth and throat. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 30, 2019 \nPage 3 \n \nOral health is not only intimately related to the health of the rest of the body, \nbut is considered a health disparity for low-income children and adults. Poor oral \nheath  can  compound  the  devastating  effects  of  chronic  conditions  and \naggravate the already fragile socio-economic securities of this population. \n \nIn 2015, 1.7 million Nevadans, which is over half the State's population, had at \nleast 1 chronic disease. The projected overall cost of chronic disease in Nevada \ncontinues to rise. Between the years 2016 to 2030, it is estimated to reach \n$401 billion. \n \nUnfortunately,  many  minority  groups  have  higher  prevalence  rates  for  heart \ndisease, cancer and diabetes. This leads to increased rates of disability and \ndeath. Assembly Bill 223 seeks to improve oral health by expanding Medicaid \ndental services for Medicaid adults, who are over 21 years of age and have \nbeen diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. \n \nThe biological link between diabetes and periodontal disease, which is the loss \nof bone and tissue surrounding the teeth is so strong that periodontitis is called \nthe sixth complication of diabetes. This is due to the chronic hyperglycemia that \noccurs in diabetics. This leads to an exaggerated immune inflammatory response \nto oral pathogens and results in rapid and severe destruction of the periodontal \ntissues.  This  leads  to  multiple  extractions,  associated  infections  and  even \ncomplete tooth loss. \n \nThis  is  costly  for  our  healthcare  system.  Poor  oral  health  has  far-reaching \nimplications that can lead to deteriorating nutritional status, mental health, and \nchronic disease conditions resulting in a higher incidence of emergency room \nvisits, hospitalization and medical expenses. \n \nSection 1 of A.B.  223 will  authorize  the Department of  Health and Human \nServices (DHHS) to apply for a demonstration waiver through the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to expand Medicaid dental services for \nindividuals 21 years of age or older that have been diagnosed with diabetes. \n \nSection  1,  subsection  1,  paragraph  (a)  would  apply  to  patients  with  well \ncontrolled  glycemic  levels  and  good  oral  health.  Section  1,  subsection  1, \nparagraph (b) would apply to patients with longstanding diabetic conditions with \npoor glycemic control and compromised oral hygiene. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 30, 2019 \nPage 4 \n \nThe hypotheses of the demonstration waiver is by expanding Medicaid dental \nservices and specifically including dental prophylaxis dental cleaning, benefits \nfor adults with diabetes; the oral and systemic health of this population will \nimprove and medical expenses associated with their condition will decrease. \nThere are also provisions to encourage and remind members who are diagnosed \nwith diabetes to utilize this expanded Medicaid benefit. \n \nSections 3 and 4 require the health maintenance organization or the managed \ncare organization that administer Medicaid services to provide written notices to \nnewly diagnosed diabetics and to coordinate with any necessary entity to insure \neligible Medicaid recipients receive their dental benefits. \n \nSection 6 requires the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the DHHS \nand  the  Division  of  Public  and  Behavioral  Health  to  submit  to  the \n81st Legislature a report concerning the implementation of this waiver. \n \nCODY  PHINNEY  (Deputy  Administrator,  Division  of  Health  Care  Financing  and \nPolicy, Department of Health and Human Services):  \nThis is a demonstration waiver and the demonstration would cover a five-year \nperiod. The development of the waiver and approval process with the CMS \ncould take up to 18 months. Also included in this bill is significant evaluation \nplanning so we can demonstrate this budget is neutral over five years. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs there anyone in support for A.B. 223? \n \nDRAKE RIDGE (Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe): \nWe are in support of A.B. 223. Native American adults are the most at risk of \nbeing diagnosed with diabetes over any other race or ethnicity. \n \nMICHAEL HACKETT (Nevada Primary Care Association): \nWe are here in support of A.B. 223. We are hopeful in the future this will apply \nto all adult dental services provided on behalf of Medicaid. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs there anyone to testify in neutral on A.B. 223? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 30, 2019 \nPage 5 \n \nPEGGY LEAR BOWEN: \nI want to thank you for taking care of all the children. Thank you for your hard \nwork to make Nevada the greatest State in the world. Go Nevada. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will accept a motion on A.B. 223. \n \nSENATOR WOODHOUSE MOVED TO DO PASS A.B. 223. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will open the hearing on A.B. 150. \n \nASSEMBLY  BILL  150  (2nd  Reprint):  Directs  the  establishment  of  a  plan  to \nexpand the program to allow certain persons over 18 years of age to \nremain under the jurisdiction of a court. (BDR S-453) \n \nJARED BUSKER (Children's Advocacy Alliance): \nI  am  here  to  present  A.B.  150  on  behalf  of  Assemblywoman  Daniele \nMonroe-Moreno. I will be reading from my testimony (Exhibit C). \n \nDuring the Interim, the Children's Advocacy Alliance met with the Committee on \nChild  Welfare  and  Juvenile  Justice  and  presented  issues  regarding  foster \nchildren who age out of the child welfare system. We were able to demonstrate \nthat these youth have worse outcomes than their peers across a variety of areas \nincluding employment, housing, early parenthood and education. \n \nCurrently, Nevada has three sources of support for youth transitioning out of \nfoster  care.  These  programs  include:  The  John  H.  Chafee  Foster  Care \nIndependence  Program,  the  Financial  Assistance  to  Former  Foster  Youth \nprogram; and The Voluntary Court Jurisdiction program, commonly referred to \nas AB350. The AB350 program was created in 2011, after A.B. No. 350 of the \n76th Session passed and became law. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 30, 2019 \nPage 6 \n \nThe purpose of A.B. 150 is to create a working group to review these existing \nprograms  as  well  as  other  options  for  providing  independent  living  and \ntransitional  supports  for  youth.    The  working  group  will  seek  to  improve \noutcomes  and  ensure  that  in  addition  to  resources,  youth  are  receiving  the \nappropriate supports that they need to successfully transition into adulthood. \n \nI will now read the proposed amendment (Exhibit D). The amendment outlines a \nGeneral Fund request of $35,553 for fiscal year (FY) 2019-2020 and $11,345 \nfor FY 2020-2021. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIt  appears  the  original  fiscal  note  of  over  $10  million  came  down  to \napproximately $37,000. Why is that? \n \nMR. BUSKER: \nYes,  the  fiscal  note  was  reduced  significantly  to  about  $40,000  over  the \nbiennium. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe fiscal note covers a staffing requirement, is that correct? \n \nROSS  ARMSTRONG  (Administrator,  Division  of  Child  and  Family  Services, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nThe fiscal note will fund a half-time contracted position to coordinate all the \ngroups that deal with family programs within the Division of Child and Family \nServices (DCFS). \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe report would go to the Legislative Committee on Child Welfare and Juvenile \nJustice, is that correct? \n \nMR. BUSKER: \nYes, that is correct. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nWe have Senate Bill (S.B.) 194 which is designed to give some financial stability \nto those coming out of foster care. I think S.B. 194 would complement this bill, \nis that correct? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 30, 2019 \nPage 7 \n \nSENATE BILL 194 (1st Reprint): Establishes programs for certain persons of \nlow-income and persons in foster care. (BDR 38-780) \n \nMR. ARMSTRONG: \nYes, the training for that population would be helpful. Another thing that could \ncome out of this study would be a federal financial contribution through our \npartnership with the federal Children's Bureau. I believe the training would be \none element to make sure the youth get the support they need to succeed and \nnot remain in our various systems of assistance or criminal justice. \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nIs the objective to get federal dollars and not rely on General Fund dollars? What \nkind of programs are we talking about? \n \nMR. ARMSTRONG: \nRegular  foster  care  receives  Title  IV-E  funding.  The  federal  match  is  about \n60 percent  to  cover  foster  youth  to  age  18.  The  DCFS  submits  a  plan  for \nTitle IV-E funding.  The plan outlines what services need to be covered and that \nplan currently stops for youth at age 18. \n \nFederal law allows for a program designed for youth between 18 and 21 years \nof age. The DCFS would be able to apply for that money. Any plan would have \nto be approved by the federal Children's Bureau. It is important to note that it is \nnot a matter of changing the age from 18 to 21 in foster care. The federal \nChildren's Bureau allows quite a bit of flexibility on how states can operate that \nprogram. This would be part of the DCFS's official Title IV-E plan. We would \nuse this funding with the appropriate General Fund match. \n \nMR. BUSKER: \nThe  intent  of  this  working  group  is  not  to  maximize  the  amount  of  federal \nfunding as a State. The working group wants to look at the existing programs \nwe  have  and  evaluate  what  is  best  for  Nevada's  foster  youth  and  provide \nrecommendations. \n \nDENISE TANATA (Children's Advocacy Alliance): \nI am here to answer any questions, but I believe Mr. Busker and Mr. Armstrong \ncovered everything in regard to A.B. 150. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 30, 2019 \nPage 8 \n \nBAILEY BORTOLIN (Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada): \nWe are in support of A.B. 150 as amended. This bill has changed quite a bit, \nand we believe we can get some good data from the study. We want to make \nsure the intent is to have the best outcomes for youth that have aged out of \nfoster care. \n \nWe currently have a program in our State laws that we refer to as the AB350 \nprogram which was the bill that created the program. We have yet to come up \nwith another name for it. We believe the AB350 program is a great State model \nthat no other states have offered. It focuses on the independence of a youth. \nThe stipends go directly to the youth. If the youth wants to stay in the foster \nhome, they can use part of the stipend as rent. The youth learns responsibility, \nbut still has oversight and support services surrounding them. This helps them \nbecome successful young adults. We are protective of this model and believe it \nis working well for a lot of youth. \n \nWe had concerns when we talked about extended foster care. Are we just \ntreating them like a foster child when they are 20 years old? Are we teaching \nthem how to be financially successful? Under this bill, the federal funding would \ngo directly to the foster parents. The foster child may not be taught financial \nresponsibility and independence. \n \nThe language in the amendment allows for a study to look at independence \nmodels  and  see  if  that  works  for  federal  funding.  We  want  to  protect  the \nprogram  we  have  in  Nevada.  We  do  not  want  to  lose  the  focus  on \nindependence. \n \nMARI  NAKASHIMA  (The  Perkins  Company;  Family  Focused  Treatment \nAssociation): \nThe Family Focused Treatment Association is a group of specialized foster care \nproviders. Both organizations are in support of A.B. 150. \n \nBRIGID DUFFY (Chief Deputy District Attorney, Juvenile Division, Clark County \nDistrict Attorney's Office): \nI am testifying on behalf of the Department of Family Services in Clark County \nin support of A.B. 150. We see a need to improve outcomes for youth aging out \nof the foster care system. The AB350 program was put into effect eight years \nago. It was innovative, but unfortunately, over the past eight years, we have \nstories of successes and we have stories of failures. We have no data to show \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 30, 2019 \nPage 9 \n \nif the program works. Clark County spends about $2.5 million in general funds \nper year on this program. There is nothing to say if that money is actually being \nwell spent. \n \nThe first day of testimony on A.B. 150, we heard children who took part in the \nAB350 program in both Clark County and Washoe County. They talked about \nthe  deficiencies  in  the  program.  They  said  the  program  did  not  make  them \nsuccessful. \n \nThe working group study should determine if it is best to hand a stipend to \nfoster youth. If it were my child and I was giving him or her $700 a month, and \nhe or she were not doing well, maybe I would have to stop the payment them \nuntil I saw movement in a better direction. Every child needs an on and off ramp \nto succeed. \n \nIt is my understanding that young adults ages 18 to 25 do not make the best \nfinancial decisions all the time. They need older adult support. I look forward to \nlooking at how other states and jurisdictions are drawing down their Title IV-E \nfunding to extend foster care services. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe do not have the bill sponsor, so we will hold off voting on A.B. 150. There \ncould be further amendments or technical adjustments. I will close the hearing \non A.B. 150. \n \nMS. BOWEN: \nWe might want to consider half way houses for foster youth. They could work \nto  help  foster  youth  become  independent.  One  such  half  way  house  is \nRidge House. Ridge House can work with young people and mentor them for \nsuccess. The goal is successful human beings. We need to give them a bridge \nto success in life. Go Nevada. \n   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 30, 2019 \nPage 10 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSeeing no further business, we are adjourned at 6:07 p.m. \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nMichelle Hamilton, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 30, 2019 \nPage 11 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nExhibit / \nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \n# of pages \n  A  1    Agenda \n  B  3    Attendance Roster \nJared Busker / Children's \nA.B. 150  C  1  Written Testimony \nAdvocacy Alliance \nJared Busker / Children's  Proposed Conceptual \nA.B. 150  D  4 \nAdvocacy Alliance  Amendment \n ", "7": "\nMINUTES OF THE  \nSENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n \nEightieth Session \nMay 30, 2019 \n \n \nThe Senate Committee on Health and Human Services was called to order by \nChair Julia Ratti at 1:20 p.m. on Thursday, May 30, 2019, on the Senate Floor \nof the Legislative Building, Carson City, Nevada.

Regardless of what part of the State we live in, health care is an \nimportant issue for the people we represent. Many families will run into trouble \nat some point: a substance abuse diagnosis, a disability or any number of other \nhealth issues. It is critical Nevada provides a social safety net to give families \nthe support they need, when they need it.  \n \nThe first item of business is the adoption of the Committee Rules for the Senate \nCommittee  on  Health  and  Human  Services  (Exhibit  C).  I  do  not  see  any \nsignificant changes in this document.  \n \nSENATOR  WOODHOUSE  MOVED  TO  ADOPT  THE  SENATE \nCOMMITTEE  ON  HEALTH  AND  HUMAN  SERVICES  RULES  FOR \nTHE 2019 SESSION. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN SECONDED THE MOTION. \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nMEGAN  COMLOSSY  (Principal  Policy  Analyst,  Research  Division,  Legislative \nCounsel Bureau): \nThe Committee Brief for the Senate Committee on Health and Human Services \n(Exhibit D) provides information about Committee staff, bill statistics from the \n2017 Legislative Session and jurisdiction of the Committee by Nevada Revised \nStatutes (NRS). It should be noted NRS 453A, Medical Use of Marijuana, is \nback under the Committee jurisdiction. In the past couple of legislative sessions \nthis issue was under the jurisdiction of the Senate Judiciary Committee.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe Committee chooses to do our business electronically. This means rather \nthan printing exhibits, we will be following the presentations from our laptops.  \n \nThe Committee will be conducting its meetings on Mondays and Wednesdays \nthrough the month of February. Starting in the month of March, this Committee \nmay have longer meetings on Mondays and Wednesdays. We are hoping to \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 6, 2019 \nPage 3 \n \navoid  the  need  to  have  a  third  meeting  on  Fridays.  At  some  point,  this \nCommittee may have to resort to Friday meetings.  \n \nFor these first two meetings, I have asked each division within the Department \nof  Health  and  Human  Services  (DHHS)  to  put  together  brief  presentations. \nI want the Committee to be familiar with the work that is already being done by \nthe DHHS. This way the Committee should consider the policies it is passing, \nand how those policies will be provided by the DHHS.  \n \nRICHARD WHITLEY (Director, Director's Office, Department of Health and Human \nServices): \nI am going to point out some highlights within the Presentation on the Director's \nOffice of the Department of Health and Human Services (Exhibit E). The DHHS \nis divided into divisions with the primary work focusing on eligibility, payment, \nregulation and a services provider.  \n \nPage 4 has a summary of the workforce that supports those activities. There \nare over 6,000 employees, and an additional 329 are being requested for this \nbiennium. The need for most of these additional employees are the result of \ncaseload growth in the Division of Aging and Disability Services.  \n \nThe DHHS accomplishments are on page 5. Nevada has two Federally Qualified \nHealth Centers (FQHC). These are safety net providers that are credentialed by \nthe federal Health Resources and Services Administration. The FQHC cannot \ndeny  service  to  anyone.  In  order  to  do  that,  these  FQHC  get  an  enhanced \nMedicaid rate. These providers do not mind treating Medicaid clients. Over the \npast  several  years,  the  DHHS  has  tried  to  create  more  FQHC,  as  well  as \nenhance the existing FQHC to provide satellite service centers. \n \nThe last Legislative Session approved DHHS to complete two FQHC incubator \nprograms.  These  programs  focused  on  the  criminal  justice  involved  clients \ngetting out of jail. People who are in jail get health care paid for by the county. \nThese people are then discharged without the medications that they need and \nno opportunity to get an appointment to get their medications. The DHHS put \nits  eligibility  workers  inside  the  jail.  On  discharge  they  are  enrolled  back  in \nMedicaid  or  have  their  Medicaid  benefits  reactivated.  The  DHHS  may  also \nreactivate  the  person's  Supplemental  Nutritional  and  Assistance  Program \n(SNAP). This incubator project allowed the FQHC to partner with the jails. This \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 6, 2019 \nPage 4 \n \nprogram uses the Fund for a Healthy Nevada, commonly known as the tobacco \nsettlement dollars.  \n \nThe DHHS has included in its budget another similar incubator program. This \nprogram deals with kids.  \n \nThe DHHS programs need to be driven by data. This allows DHHS to evaluate \nthe outcomes of its programs. This biennium, the DHHS used Affordable Care \nAct funds to hire a health economist. The DHHS would rather prevent a crisis \nthan create longer lines for health care. The best example of this is childhood \nimmunizations.  The  collection  of  data  allows  DHHS  to  focus  its  activities. \nProbably the most robust data are found in the criminal justice system. When \none looks at the intervention points, such as law enforcement, getting arrested, \nand sent to a specialty court, the data show the benefit for the specialty courts. \nThe data allow us to target strategies in a cost effective way.  \n \nPage 6 of Exhibit E summarizes more DHHS accomplishments. One relates to \nthe opioid problem. Julia Peek and Dr. Woodard have been successful acquiring \nfederal funding. The DHHS has received national recognition for the work we \nhave done in this area. \n \nLast  Legislative  Session,  the  DHHS  was  able  to  re-establish  the  Office  of \nMinority Health and Equity. This office is comprised of one person. This position \nis partially funded with tobacco settlement dollars.  \n \nThe next accomplishment addresses the \"lessons learned\" from the 1 October \nevent. This applies to victim compensation. The DHHS has several programs \nfunded by the U.S. Department of Justice for victims of crime, but these funds \nare scattered among several State agencies. There is one funding stream in the \nAttorney  General's  Office.  There  is  another  funding  stream  for  victim \ncompensation in the Department of Administration. Within the DHHS Division of \nChild and Family Services, there is a Victim Services Program. These programs \nare all funded from one federal agency. What was learned on 1 October was the \nvarious State agencies do not coordinate these programs. The DHHS has had \ntrouble  just  convening  meetings  with  these  agencies.  The  State  could  do \na better job coordinating the grants for victims of crime.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 6, 2019 \nPage 5 \n \nJULIA PEEK (Deputy Director, Programs, Director's Office, Department of Health \nand Human Services): \nPage 10 of Exhibit E summarizes the Director's Office Goals and Initiatives. \nI would like to draw the Committee's attention to the Nevada Legislative District \nHealth Profiles and Maps (Exhibit F). I have provided each Senator a brief. The \npublic  and  Committee  members  can  access  this  information.  This  webpage \ncontains Legislative Health Profiles for each Senatorial District and other public \nbehavioral and health profiles. This data is provided by the Office of Analytics \nand  Publications.  This  is  just  an  example  of  the  level  of  data  DHHS  has \navailable. The DHHS also has models from Public Health Accreditation, where \nneeds assessments are done. The DHHS is evaluating its programs and ways to \nmake them transparent to the public.  \n \nI want to highlight DHHS has applied for another FQHC incubator project. This \ntime the DHHS wants to focus on children and adolescents. This is the early \npoint in a person's life where there can be a discussion about preventative \nhealth and early intervention.  \n \nMR. WHITLEY: \nThe DHHS budget is the largest it has ever been in the Department's history. \nThe DHHS is being strategic in its grant acquisitions. The DHHS is maximizing \nMedicaid, however, we have seen the largest increase in behavioral health in a \ndecade.  \n \nThe DHHS wants to advance, but is continually challenged by changes at the \nfederal level. The DHHS was impacted by the recent government shutdown. \nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture funds all of the food security programs. The \nDHHS  was  fine,  but  realized  how  fragile  these  programs  are  and  our \ndependence on the federal government. The shutdown could have potentially \naffected  School  Lunch,  Three  Square,  Food  Bank  of  Northern  Nevada  and \nSNAP. This was a negative experience and it did show how reliant we are on \nthe federal government.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nAre we able to suspend Medicaid and quickly re-enroll a person once they get \nout of jail? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 6, 2019 \nPage 6 \n \nMR. WHITLEY: \nThat  is  my  understanding,  but  I  would  rather  defer  that  question  to  Steve \nFisher.  \n \nROSS  ARMSTRONG  (Administrator,  Division  of  Child  and  Family  Services, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nOn page 2 of the Presentation on the Division of Child and Family Services \n(Exhibit G) is the Vision and Mission of the Division of Child and Family Services \n(DCFS). The Vision has been recently updated to, \"Safe, Healthy, and Thriving \nKids in Every Nevada Community.\" The order is very specific, with safety being \nthe number one priority, but our job does not end there. The DCFS needs to \nmake  sure  it  helps  kids  in  every  Nevada  community,  not  just  geographic \ncommunities,  but  certain  subsections.  For  example,  the  DCFS  knows  the \njuvenile  justice  and  child  welfare  systems  disproportionately  contact  the \nAfrican-American community, or that the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender \nkids have special needs and risks that need to be addressed. When the DCFS \ntalks about every Nevada community, it is not justice by geography, but also \nspecial populations that have specific needs.  \n \nPage 3 of Exhibit G is the Organizational Chart. The DCFS has made a recent \nshift in the focus for its Deputy Administrators. Before they were focused on a \nsystems  based  model.  The  DCFS  had  a  Deputy  Administrator  over  Juvenile \nJustice, Child Welfare, Mental Health and Administrative Services. The DCFS \nnow  has  touch  points  in  four  systems;  Residential  Services,  Community \nServices, Quality and Oversight and Administrative. This changes the deputy \nadministrator's focus on the service DCFS provides.  \n \nPage 6 outlines the Juvenile Justice Facility Populations. It should be noted the \nCaliente Youth Center is the only youth facility with both gendered kids in it. \nThe Summit View Youth Center is the only physically secure juvenile justice \nfacility, which means it has the fence and razor wire. The other campuses are \nopen.  \n \nPage  7  of  Exhibit  G  talks  about  the  DCFS  Accomplishments.  The  main \naccomplishment  is  the  Juvenile  Justice  Reform.  This  created  the  Juvenile \nJustice Oversight Commission (JJOC). The JJOC created a statewide risk and \nneeds assessment tool. This way DCFS can establish actual needs rather than \nsimply case management based on the crime a youth may have committed. This \nwill allow DCFS to look at the deeper needs and provide case planning around \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 6, 2019 \nPage 7 \n \nthe  highest  risks.  The  JJOC  approved  the  Correctional  Programs  Checklist, \nwhich is a validation tool used to evaluate the performance of the three State \nfacilities and the two county camps.  \n \nThe DCFS is administering its Systems of Care Implementation Grant. This has \nhelped with the training and the establishment of community services within the \nchildren's mental and behavioral health realm.  \n \nThe October 1, 2017 incident in Las Vegas, often referred to as the 1 October \nevent, pinpointed a greater need for victim services collaboration in Nevada. The \nDCFS has the Victims of Crimes Assistance Grant and is the Victim's Agency. \nThe DCFS has applied for a grant from the U.S. Department of Justice that is \nspecifically related to the response to the 1 October event.  \n \nThe DCFS decided it was time to get the victim serving agencies together. \nThese agencies include the Attorney General's Office, the Department of Public \nSafety, the DCFS and the Department of Administration. These agencies meet \nmonthly.  One  of  the  first  accomplishments  was  the  development  of  teams \nbetween  the  Attorney  General's  Office  and  the  DCFS.  They  developed  a \ntimeline  for  the  victim's  grants.  This  helped  agencies  to  predict  when  they \nneeded to have resources ready to draft their grant applications and have some \ncertainty when they could expect grant funding. The DCFS continues to work \nwith these agencies to look for ways to maximize victim services.  \n \nPage 8 of Exhibit G talks about upcoming Major Initiatives. The DCFS has a lot \nof initiatives that are related to federal compliance. For example, every five \nyears child welfare agencies get a Child and Family Services Review. Yesterday, \nthe DCFS officially received results from the United States Children's Bureau. In \nresponse,  the  DCFS  had  meetings  with  county  agency  partners  and \nstakeholders to develop a State Program Improvement Plan. This is a two year \nplan to work toward meeting those federal benchmarks.  \n \nAnother  area  the  DCFS  is  addressing  is  the  commercial  sexually  exploited \nchildren.  There  will  be  a  proposal  of  a  bill  for  children  who  are  sexually \nexploited. For example, if you have a child that is being sexually exploited and \nthey are with their pimp in Las Vegas, child welfare does not have a role, \nbecause that pimp is not the child's parent. It creates a whole different case \nmanagement structure. The bill would allow child welfare agencies to take those \nreports, which they cannot take now. Rather than work a formal case toward \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 6, 2019 \nPage 8 \n \nunification, the victim is connected to the services they need to be safe and \nstart that healing process. This is a federal requirement and we expect this bill \nto come from the Interim Committee for Child Welfare and Juvenile Justice.  \n \nIn the juvenile justice realm, the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) continues to \nbe  a  moving  target.  There  are  some  specific  parameters  around  juvenile \nfacilities. The Committee will see in our budget a fairly large enhancement for \nstaffing. To comply with PREA, juvenile facilities need to have a staffing ratio of \n1:8 during the day and 1:16 at night. The DCFS would not be able to meet \nthose ratios using overtime or reduced beds.  \n \nThe DCFS also provides mobile crisis services in Washoe and Clark Counties, \nand partners with the Division of Public and  Behavioral Health for the rural \nservices. This helps a lot of families stay together and divert children from being \nhospitalized for behavioral health needs.  \n \nThe System of Care Implementation Grant will end at the close of this fiscal \nyear.  The  DCFS  did  receive  a  Rural  Telemedicine  Grant  that  focuses  on \nchildren's behavioral health and connecting kids in rural areas with services in \nurban areas so they do not have to travel far to receive those services.  \n \nThe DCFS is converting three mental health facilities to psychiatric residential \ntreatment centers. Clients will have an increase in medical assistance, nursing \nand be provided a higher level of service. At the same time, DHHS can increase \nits amount of Medicaid revenue.  \n \nAnother  major  initiative  is  the  Nevada  Center  for  Juvenile  Justice \nInnovation (NCJJI). Part of the Juvenile Justice System Reform Act, there was \nmoney for the establishment of the NCJJI. The NCJJI serves as an information \nhub for any of the juvenile justice agencies within the State. The Center is here \nto help Nevada agencies.  \n \nThe  Unified  Nevada  Information  Technology  for  Youth  (UNITY)  is  federally \nrequired  to  move  from  a  Statewide  Automated  Child  Welfare  Information \nSystem (SACWIS) to a directional data exchange. The DCFS has heard end \nusers have difficulties using the UNITY system. For example, Clark County is \nusing a system to help match a kid to the best fit for a foster parent. Currently, \nClark County has to do double-entry to use the current system. This upgrade \nwill allow the two systems to talk. This will help bring UNITY forward and \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 6, 2019 \nPage 9 \n \nmaintain federal compliance. It will also allow child welfare agencies to use data \nin new ways to improve the outcomes for kids.  \n \nThe CaseloadPRO system for juvenile justice will collect data from the county \nprobation  departments  and  the  State  to  tackle  issues  of  recidivism  and \ndisproportionate minority contact.  \n \nPage 9 of Exhibit G covers Opportunities and Challenges. One of the challenges \nfor the Division of Child and Family Services (DCFS) is staff recruitment. When \nthe economy is roaring it can be difficult to keep staff. There are also some \nchallenges  with  the  background  requirements.  For  example,  in  our  juvenile \njustice  facilities,  if  your  background  check  reveals  you  had  a  marijuana \nconviction from the 1980s you are disqualified, but you can be hired, as long as \na  robbery  was  more  than  seven  years  ago.  Those  issues  can  make  hiring \ndecisions  difficult.  The  DCFS  has  had  some  success  in  reclassifying  social \nworkers to case management specialists. This has helped some of the vacancy \nissues.  \n \nThe federal Families First Prevention Services Act (FFPSA) allows the DCFS for \nthe first time to use federal dollars for prevention services. Currently, we only \nget federal money when a kid is removed. This will allow DCFS to help on the \nfront end. The FFPSA is supposed to be implemented in October, but the federal \nguidance has not been released. \n \nThe Supreme Court has the Children's Commission, which is trying to take all \nthe different child serving boards and commissions and come up with a unified \nstrategy on how Nevada is going to tackle some of its big issues. This will \nprovide an opportunity for cross-communication and strategic planning in the \nareas of child welfare, juvenile justice, education and children's mental health. \n \nThe DCFS is working on a waiver for specialized foster care. How does one pay \nfor the needs of kids in specialized foster care? These are youth who are in \nfoster care who have higher behavioral health needs. The DCFS is working on a \npackage to get appropriate medical reimbursement for these specialized medical \nservices.  \n \nThe  DCFS  makes  data-informed  decisions  using  the  Centralized  Office  of \nAnalytics in the Director's Office. For example, the DCFS knows for example, \nthree out of four youths who leave juvenile justice have not returned to prison \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 6, 2019 \nPage 10 \n \nwithin five years. DCFS is able to divert three out of four youths using that \ndata. The DCFS is looking at ways to improve that.  \n \nDENA SCHMIDT (Administrator, Aging and Disability Services Division, Department \nof Health and Human Services):  \nOn page 2 of the Presentation on the Aging and Disability Services Division \n(Exhibit H), there are a couple of changes to the Organization Chart. The Aging \nand Disability Services Division (ADSD) has identified a Quality Assurance Unit. \nThe  ADSD  has  statewide  oversight  of  all  quality  assurance  processes  and \nensures each program within our purview has a quality assurance component.  \n \nThere is another recent change that is not reflected on this chart. That change \nis the Committee Based Care Program which is our Home and Community Based \nWaivers for the Frail, Elderly and Physically Disabled. This program is now under \nDevelopmental Services. This aligns all three of our Medicaid waivers under one \nadministrator.  \n \nThe  Position  Summary  is  on  page  3  of  Exhibit  H.  The  ADSD  is  requesting \n97 positions and those are according to caseload growth. The demand for our \nservices continues to grow as the population of Nevada continues to grow. Of \nthose positions, 21 support changes in our Intermediate Care Facility.  \n \nBill Draft Requests (BDR) are on page 4. The ADSD has one BDR which revises \nprovisions relating to providers of Jobs and Day Training (JDT) services. The \nJDT providers vary from a mom-pop shop to a large corporate organization. \nSome  of  the  ADSD  financial  requirements  are  burdensome  to  the  smaller \nemployers and we are looking to reduce that burden. This BDR seeks to move it \nto our policies, where we can adapt those requirements based on the size of the \nprovider.  \n \nThe  ADSD  has  two  budget  BDRs.  One  deals  with  the  waitlist  for  home \nmodifications. Currently there are set-aside funds within the Independent Living \nGrants for assisted living and those funds have not been utilized over the past \nseveral years. The ADSD would like the ability to have some flexibility to move \nthose funds to address waitlists when we have them.  \n \nThe second budget BDR requests the authority for the ADSD to receive and \ninvestigate  allegations  of  abuse,  neglect  and  exploitation  of  vulnerable \nindividuals between the ages of 18-59. Currently, the ADSD Elder Protective \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 6, 2019 \nPage 11 \n \nService Program takes calls and complaints from individuals age 60 and older, \nbut  it  does  not  have  the  ability  to  investigate  calls  and  complaints  for \nindividuals 18-59. That is a population that has been underserved. This BDR will \nallow ADSD to take a service that is currently offered and expand it to all \npopulations within our purview.  \n \nA Summary of Agency Operations is on page 5 of Exhibit H. There are a variety \nof direct services as well as grant funded services. Many people assume that \nwe are a direct services provider. In many instances, ADSD is not a direct \nservices provider; we actually grant Older American Act dollars for a variety of \nservices. These services range from transportation, home delivered meals and \ncaregiver trainings to Medicare information programs.  \n \nAccomplishments are on page 6 of Exhibit H. I just want to point out in a \nhealthy  economy  our  providers  are  struggling  to  retain  staff.  A  lot  of  the \npositions and services ADSD provides is direct care, and those services are \nchallenged by turnover. The ADSD was able to provide a 5 percent rate increase \nfor Supported Living Arrangement and JDT Providers.  \n \nThe Desert Regional Center provides for 41 individuals who reside there. The \nADSD  was  under  a  Systems  Improvement  Agreement  last  year.  As  of \nDecember, the ADSD is now in compliance. Gaining compliance changed the \nway  the  ADSD  looked  at  the  facility.  Currently,  the  ADSD  view  it  as  a \nresidence, rather than as just a facility. The ADSD feels they have improved the \nlives of the 41 individuals who live there.  \n \nThe ADSD has done a lot of work around the waiver enrollment processes. This \ncan be cumbersome for individuals trying to get home and community based \nwaiver services. The ADSD has looked at ways to streamline and reduce wait \ntimes to get into its waiver programs.  \n \nThe ADSD Elder Protective Services (EPS) has grown a lot over the past couple \nof years. The EPS participated in the National Adult Maltreatment Reporting \nSystem (NAMRS). The NAMRS is a national database that collects information \nregarding adult maltreatment. Nevada was one of the first states to participate \nand report to this database. The ADSD was able to get grant funds to increase \ndata capacity for the first required sets of data. Now the ADSD is going to \nexpand and report additional data.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 6, 2019 \nPage 12 \n \nThe ADSD became a partner with the Nevada Attorney General's Office in the \nEnd Abuse in Later Life Grant. The ADSD is providing training in elder protective \nservices  for  the  Attorney  General's  Office  and  local  law  enforcement. \nThe Attorney  General's  Office  and  local  law  enforcement  are  providing \ninvestigation training for ADSD. This has become a coordinated effort. There are \nnow teams in smaller communities to deal with severe cases that are difficult \nand  have  circumstances  where  there  is  no  one  solution.  All  these  different \nentities come together to work on a solution.  \n \nOn  page  7  of  Exhibit  H  is  a  summary  of  major  enhancements.  These \nenhancements mostly address the challenge of getting direct support staff. One \nof the things the ADSD wanted to look at in its budget is where the direct \nsupport  needs  are,  and  how  to  provide  rate  increases  to  some  of  those \nprograms.  The  ADSD  is  looking  for  a  rate  increase  in  its  Supported  Living \nArrangement Program, Attendant Care Services, Personal Assistance Services \nProgram and Community Options Program for the Elderly Services. These are all \nin-home services, where individuals go into the home and provide assistance for \ndaily  living.  Some  of  these  services  might  be  light  housekeeping,  cooking, \nshopping, bathing, dressing or grooming. \n \nAnother  enhancement  looks  at  increased  funding  for  some  of  our  waitlist \nprograms. The ADSD has several with a program waitlist; one is the Autism \nTreatment Assistance Program (ATAP). The ADSD has seen a lot of growth in \nprovider capacity. The ADSD was challenged by billing Medicaid and moved all \nchildren on Medicaid to a Medicaid provider. This freed up State General Fund \ndollars to serve those kids who did not have access to autism treatment. This \nwill help ADSD get kids off of that waitlist.  \n \nThe  ADSD  has  a  request  to  add  21  staff  to  support  its  Intermediate  Care \nFacility. This is the result of one of the recommendations from the National \nConsultants. They determined ADSD was not meeting staffing ratios and were \nusing overtime to an extent that it was detrimental to the care that was being \nprovided.  \n \nWithin the Home and Community Based Services there is a waitlist. The ADSD \nwas provided funding to decrease the waitlist during the last Session. However, \nthe  demand  has  continued  to  grow  and  the  ADSD  will  need  more  funding. \nThe senior population is one of the fastest growing populations in Nevada.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 6, 2019 \nPage 13 \n \nNevada is one of three states that does not provide Adult Protective Services. \nThe ADSD is requesting the authority to accept and receive allegations of abuse  \nor neglect and investigate those allegations. This applies to vulnerable adults \nages 18-59. The ADSD currently provides this service for adults ages 60 and \nover and the Division of Child and Family Services (DCFS) provides this service \nfor children. However, vulnerable adults ages 18-59 are not afforded that same \nright. The National Association for Protective Services Associations created a \nteam of consultants to help us to plan and implement this expansion.  \n \nJULIE  KOTCHEVAR  (Administrator,  Division  of  Public  and  Behavioral  Health, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nThe Senate Committee on Health and Human Services Presentation, Division of \nPublic and Behavioral Health (DPBH) (Exhibit I) covers the Division's Mission and \nVision, Organizational Chart and Summary of Agency Operations. The DPBH \nAccomplishments are covered on pages 6 and 7. The DPBH was able to use \ngrant  funding  from  the  Women's  Health  Connection  for  breast  and  cervical \ncancer screenings. The DPBH screened 2,500 additional women who would not \nhave qualified because they were between the ages of 40-49, and the eligibility \nage is 50 and older. The DPBH detected 13 cases of breast cancer, 15 cases of \ncervical cancer and 92 women who had pre-cancerous cells. Everyone who was \nidentified was able to connect with treatment within 60 days of identification.  \n \nAnother  accomplishment  was  the  creation  of  Certified  Community  Behavior \nHealth Clinics (CCBHC). This was important, because they are the only safety \nnet service providers besides the State who can offer the same level of services \nand get reimbursed. This expanded the DPBH's ability to provide outpatient \nservices in communities where the patient lives and relieve them of having to \ntravel.  \n \nPages 8 and 9 summarize the DPBH's Opportunities and Challenges. The DPBH \ngrouped our opportunities and challenges together so that we could talk about \nour major initiatives. What the DPBH is experiencing in the realm of behavioral \nhealth is an increase in the acuity and complexity of health cases. These are \nclients who are difficult to serve. They may have criminal justice involvement or \nsignificant mental illness making them difficult to manage. We are also seeing \nan  increase  in  persons  with  a  combination  of  mental  illness  and  dementia. \nCommunity programs and hospitals are telling the DPBH that they cannot serve \nthese more complex or violent clients.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 6, 2019 \nPage 14 \n \nPage 11 of Exhibit I outlines the DPBH Major Initiatives based on the challenges \nwe  are  experiencing.  The  Community  Mental  Health  Services  has  a  budget \nincrease to add additional CCBHC. We currently have 3 clinics and are looking \nto add another 7 clinics, so there would be a total of 10 CCBHC.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDoes the Governor's Budget have a Medicaid Institutions for Mental Diseases \n(IMD) waiver? \n \nMS. KOTCHEVAR: \nThe III5 Waiver would do both the CCBHC and the IMD. The DPBH is proposing \nto write for the CCBHC and also the \"ability\" for the State to do an IMD waiver. \nCurrently, there is no funding in the Governor's Executive Budget to cover the \nIMD portion of that.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI find the increase in complaints alarming. Do you have any insight as to what is \ndriving that increase? \n \nMS. KOTCHEVAR: \nI do not find the increase alarming, but I am alarmed at the lack of timely \ninvestigation  of  complaints.  I  think  complaints  are  good.  People  are  seeing \nsomething and saying something. There has been a push at the federal level to \nget parents to understand that they can file a complaint if they are unhappy \nwith their childcare. The DPBH saw more parent initiated complaints, which is \ngood. In regard to the facility complaints, I think there are more advocates and \nmore people understanding that if they are unhappy with their health care, they \ndo have a say. People may not have the ability to choose where they go, but \nthis awareness empowers them to complain if they are getting poor service.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 6, 2019 \nPage 15 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSince there is no public comment, this meeting is adjourned at 5:30 p.m.  \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nMichelle Hamilton, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 6, 2019 \nPage 16 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nExhibit / \nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \n# of pages \n  A  2    Agenda \n  B  3    Attendance Roster \nCommittee Rules for the \n  C  2  Senator Julia Ratti   Senate Committee on Health \nand Human Services \nThe Committee Brief for \nMegan Comlossy / Research \n  D  12  Senate Committee on Health \nDivision \nand Human Services  \nRichard Whitley /  Presentation on the Director's \n  E  12  Department of Health and  Office of the Department of \nHuman Services  Health and Human Services  \nJulia Peek / Department of  Nevada Legislative District \n  F  1 \nHealth and Human Services  Health Profiles and Maps \nRoss Armstrong / \nPresentation on the Division \n  G  10  Department of Health and \nof Child and Family Services  \nHuman Services \nDena Schmidt / Department  Presentation on the Aging \n  H  9  of Health and Human  and Disability Services \nServices  Division  \nJulie Kotchevar /  Presentation on the Division \n  I  12  Department of Health and  of Public and Behavioral \nHuman Services  Health  \n ", "10": "\n \n \nMINUTES OF THE  \nSENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n \nEightieth Session \nFebruary 11, 2019 \n \n \nThe Senate Committee on Health and Human Services was called to order by \nChair Julia Ratti at 4:03 p.m. on Monday, February 11, 2019, in Room 1214 of \nthe  Legislative  Building,  Carson City,  Nevada.

Page 4 of \nthe presentation shows a summary of our positions; we have 2,100 positions \nwithin the DWSS. This slide is broken down by budget account; however, the \nbudget accounts do align with our programs within the DWSS. Page 5 of the \npresentation describes our bill draft requests (BDR). We have three BDRs, all of \nwhich are Child Support Enforcement bills. One is a budget bill.  \n \nThe first bill of the three bills is an insurance claims data matching bill allowing \nthe Child Support Enforcement Program to identify, and if appropriate, seize \nassets of delinquent child support obligors. It is currently voluntary for insurance \ncompanies  to  enroll  in  this  data  matching  process;  this  bill  will  make  it \nmandatory for insurance companies to enroll.  \n \nBill two relates to the suspension of recreational licenses, such as hunting or \nfishing licenses, for failure to comply with child support orders. This occurs \ntoday through the judicial or court ordered process. We would like to remove \nthis from the court system making it an administrative process; for example, the \nsuspension of a driver license.  \n \nPage 6 of Exhibit C shows a summary of our agency operations. We have the \nagency broken down into five operational areas. Director Whitley briefly touched \non  program  outreach  during  his  presentation  last  week.  We  have  30  case \nworkers  who  are  positioned  in  non-traditional  locations  where  they  provide \neligibility services in locations such as detention centers, or in a hospital. We \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2019 \nPage 3 \n \nhave two public assistance programs which require work activities for those \nprograms.  \n \nROBERT THOMPSON  (Deputy  Administrator,  Division  of  Welfare  and  Supportive \nServices, Department of Health and Human Services): \nPage 7 of Exhibit C shows a visual of the three primary programs we provide \nthrough the DWSS. We service 736,000 unique individuals each month. The \nmajority of our customers are receiving more than one program at a time; for \nexample, Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). \nMedicaid serves all low-income Nevadans: children, pregnant women, nursing \nhome  residents,  homeless,  the  temporary  and  permanently  disabled, \nunemployed  and  through  the  Affordable  Care  Act,  childless  adults.  The \nTemporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) welfare program provides cash \nassistance and over two-thirds of the 23,000 individuals receiving TANF are \nchildren. Half of those children are being raised by a nonparent relative such as \na  grandmother  receiving  a  subsidy  from  us  to  assist  in  raising  those \ngrandchildren.  The  TANF  program  also  has  the  employment  and  training \ncomponent  that  Mr.  Fisher  spoke  about.  We  engage  approximately  5,000 \nindividuals per month. The 736,000 individuals we serve are generated from \napproximately 58,000 applications per month. We touch up to 145,000 cases \nper month and we service approximately 60,000 telephone calls per month.  \n \nPage 8 describes our Energy Assistance Program. We service approximately \n2,000  households  per  month  with  this  program  from  two  different  funding \nsources.  We  focus  that  program  on  the  elderly  and  disabled,  providing \nassistance with their heating and cooling costs and, in some cases, upgrading \ntheir homes to become more energy efficient.  \n \nNOVA  MURRAY  (Deputy  Administrator,  Division  of  Welfare  and  Supportive \nServices, Department of Health and Human Services): \nProjections for child care on page 9 of Exhibit C show a fairly small population, \nalthough  you  can  see  that  number  has  been  climbing.  The  Child  Care  and \nDevelopment Fund (CCDF) program primarily provides child care subsidies to \nfamilies  receiving  public  assistance,  or  those  transitioning  from  public \nassistance, and helps them obtain child care so they can work or attend training \nor educational programs. Eleven percent of our funding is used for quality for \nchildren, infants and toddlers. Currently we have five subgrantees that provide \nactivities  for  our  agency  with  the  Children's  Cabinet  and  the  Urban  League \ndoing the eligibility activities. The Department of Education does our quality and \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2019 \nPage 4 \n \nwe subgrant for licensing activities with the Division of Public and Behavioral \nHealth and Washoe County. In the next biennium the goals of the CCDF are \nstrong fiscal monitoring, reducing financial burden on families, identifying gaps \nin our service, providing intervention through Child and Family Services and \nsome flexibility in criteria for those who are homeless. We are also looking at \nsuspension prevention for social and emotional intervention.  \n \nAdditionally, we would like to mention the Child Support Program. This program \nis a partnership between the State and nine participating counties. We have \n89,000 cases from which we collected $221 million in child support last year. \nWe  provide  the  five  basic  services  and  compete  for  incentives  for  similar \nprograms to those in our area. Those programs include incentives for paternity \nestablishment,  support  order  establishment,  and  collections  on  current  and \narrears support. Additionally, cost effectiveness and the goals in the program for \nthis  biennium  are  the  Child  Support  Replacement  System  and  ensuring  that \nsystem meets our requirements.  \n \nMR. THOMPSON: \nAs  shown  on  page  10  of  Exhibit  C,  over  the  last  two  years  we  have  had \nsignificant  accomplishments  within  the  Division  of  Welfare  and  Supportive \nServices (DWSS) and it would not be possible without the hard work of our \nstaff.  Our  accomplishments  have  occurred  in  three  general  areas;  program \nimprovements,  customer  service  and  efficiencies.  Our  Child  Support \nEnforcement  Program  has  moved  from  25th  in  the  nation  to  13th;  a  huge \naccomplishment for the DWSS. We can attribute this to the integration of our \nEmployment  and  Training  Program  and  the  One-Stop  system  in  southern \nNevada, as well as northern Nevada. Certainly our accomplishments in customer \nservice and efficiencies played a significant role in our Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program (SNAP) receiving a $1.5 million bonus. We were one of \nthree states that received most improved for access. The four goals for the \nDWSS include improving customer access; creating opportunities for increased \nself-sufficiency;  improving  efficiencies  through  technology  across  the \ndepartment;  and  seeking  collaborative  opportunities  to  enhance  efficiencies, \nconsistency and responsiveness to our customers. Page 12 describes the major \ninitiatives for the next biennium. As Ms. Murray pointed out, the Child Support \nReplacement System is the number one initiative within the DWSS. This project \nreplaces an antiquated child support enforcement system. This is a five year \ninformation technology project approved by the 2017 Legislature. We are back \nagain this Session for additional funding for the next two years, and will be back \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2019 \nPage 5 \n \nagain  next  Session  for  an  additional  two  years.  Other  initiatives  include \nimproving access to our Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program and \nimproving access to our Child Care Program. We will also be improving the \nefficiency within our Energy Assistance Program by streamlining the business \nprocess.  \n \nPage 13 of Exhibit C lists the opportunities and challenges faced by the DWSS. \nWe are taking a hard look at our policies for opportunities to possibly reduce the \nadministrative burden to our customers. For example, we are taking a look at \nour SNAP certification process. Today if you have a household that does not \nhave an elderly person in the home and you are eligible for SNAP, you must \nrecertify every six months. We are looking to extend that to every 12 months in \norder to align with our Medicaid program. The Medicaid program dictates you \nrecertify  every  12 months.  If  you  do  have  a  household  with  an  elderly  or \ndisabled individual, you recertify every 12 months. We want to extend that to \nevery 24 months. In addition to that, once we roll out the 12 and 24 months, \nwe can apply for a waiver to extend it to 36 months for households with an \nelderly  person  in  the  home.  Through  SNAP  we  currently  load  customer \nelectronic benefit transfer (EBT) cards with their benefits and they are available \non the first day of the month. This puts a heavy burden on the retailers. We are \nlooking to distribute those benefits during the first ten days of the month rather \nthan loading the cards for everyone on the first. We are also looking at relaxing \nresources within both the TANF and Medicaid programs; increasing some of \nthose resource limits and other areas within these two programs.  \n \nI would like to give the Committee an update on suspending Medicaid eligibility \nfor incarcerated individuals. We currently terminate services; however, we have \nmade some changes to our eligibility technology to allow for suspending; we \nhave yet to implement that. We have two areas we need to complete, one being \nthe policy around when do we suspend services and for how long. Once that \npolicy  decision  is  made  we  may  have  to  make  minor  adjustments  to  our \ntechnology to make that happen. Currently we are not notified by the detention \ncenters when someone either enters or exits a facility. It would be nice to have \nan electronic process to let us know this information.  \n \nAll of our programs are federal programs administered by the State, so we face \nchallenges  with  our  federal  partners.  Our  programs  are  under  continuing \nresolution, so we are unsure whether we will receive funding or if funding will \ncontinue. The federal shutdown created angst for us as well.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2019 \nPage 6 \n \n \nSUZANNE BIERMAN (Administrator, Division of Health Care Financing and Policy, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nI will be reviewing the presentation on the Division of Health Care Financing and \nPolicy (DHCFP) for you (Exhibit D).  \n \nWhile the DHCFP is primarily a payer of services, our overall goal is to improve \nthe health of Nevadans. While we administer the Nevada State Medicaid and \nNevada Check Up Program (CHIP), we are cognizant of the role of other social \ndeterminants of health and want our efforts to ultimately result in a healthier \npopulation. Approximately 680,000, or nearly 1 in 5 Nevadans receive their \nhealthcare coverage through Medicaid and CHIP programs. That breaks down to \napproximately 650,000 individuals on the Medicaid program with an additional \n30,000 children on the Check Up Program. Nevada Medicaid is a large payer of \nall births in this State covering about 65 percent of births, and nationally the \nlargest payer of behavioral health services and health care in Nevada. We have a \nlarge role in financing health care and are cognizant of the important social \ndeterminants. The DHCFP wants to work with our partners to ensure access to \ncare providing services in a sufficient manner, and reviewing Medicaid and other \nprograms to maximize federal revenue coming to Nevada.  \n \nOur goals include ensuring the care we provide is cost efficient and effective, \nand  we  engage  in  program  integrity  efforts  to  make  sure  the  services  we \nprovide  are  medically  necessary.  We  are  committed  to  ensuring  appropriate \nmanaged care oversight and building the home and community based service \ndelivery model. While we understand institutional care services are important for \na segment of the population, we want to ensure there is a robust array of \nalternatives to that setting.  \n \nThe first item related to the DHCFP operations shows that Medicaid is a federal \nand State partnership so we work closely with the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services. Medicaid is administered jointly by the State and federal \ngovernment, whereas Medicare is a federal program. Nevada uses two primary \nservice delivery models. We have a Managed Care System in the urban areas \nwith  about  72  percent  of  the  overall  population  served  by  managed  care \ncompanies. The remaining 28 percent are served through the Fee for Service \nprogram,  which  means  Medicaid  directly  reimburses  providers  for  those \nservices. This is divided by the geography of the State with Managed Care \nOrganizations (MCOs) operating in urban areas and Fee for Service programs \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2019 \nPage 7 \n \noperating in Nevada rural areas. Medicaid does provide some services that other \ncommercial insurers and the Medicare program do not typically provide. One \nexample  is  Long-Term  Care  services.  Medicaid  also  provides  non-emergency \nmedical transportation.  \n \nThe  Medicaid  Management  Information  System  (MMIS)  is  our  primary \nIT System.  It  is  outdated  and  overhauling  this  system  has  been  a  major \nundertaking; one that I am happy to report has gone smoothly and successfully. \nThis system is used to pay claims and enroll providers and we expect system \nchanges to be quicker, making for a more nimble system. Nevada is the first \nstate to implement an MMIS and offer completely paperless claims.  \n \nWe have expanded the number of managed care carriers in the State from two \nto three. We worked with our partners in the Division of Public and Behavioral \nHealth to implement the Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic model. \nCurrently  there  are  three  sites  in  Nevada  that  are  participating  in  that \ndemonstration  project.  This  provides  for  the  integration  of  physical  and \nbehavioral health services, particularly those in rural areas that have not always \nhad access to behavioral health and primary care services. One of the unique \nthings about this model is that you can receive both services in one setting. We \nhave  been  working  on  an  initiative  to  ensure  the  services  we  provide  are \nmedically necessary and appropriate.  \n \nThe 1115 Demonstration Waiver for the Certified Community Behavioral Health \nClinics  currently  has  three  clinics.  We  are  hoping  to  grow  that  number  to \n10 clinics and are working with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \nto get authority to continue and increase that program. We are working on a \n1915(i) State Plan Home and Community-Based Services plan that would allow \nMedicaid  to  pay  for  services  for  the  chronically  homeless.  While  Medicaid \ncannot pay for residential services or housing, it can provide assistance needed \nfor  individuals  to  find  and  keep  housing.  We  have  been  working  with  the \nNevada Hospital Association to develop a Hospital Provider Fee.  \n \nOne of the key challenges for the DHCFP has been changes in the federal match \nrate.  These  are  challenges  that  have  been  anticipated  and  included  in  our \nbudget. Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), a couple of eligibility categories \nreceived enhanced funding for a period of time. One of those in particular is the \nnewly eligible adults or the State's Medicaid expansion program. While Nevada \nwill  always,  unless  statutes  change,  receive  an  enhanced  match  rate  of \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2019 \nPage 8 \n \n90 percent,  that  rate  has  tapered  over  the  last  couple  of  years,  starting  at \n100 percent federally matched for three years. By the time we get to fiscal year \n(FY) 2021, it will be at 90 percent where it stays thereafter; each year that \nmatch rate has dropped some. We will top out at the federal government paying \n90 percent of the cost of services for that eligibility group. Similarly, under the \nACA,  there  was  enhanced  match  rates  for  the  Children's  Health  Insurance \nProgram and Nevada benefited from an enhanced match rate for a number of \nyears. By FY 2022 it will return to its non-enhanced standard rate, and by \nFY 2021 it is back to 78 percent. While small percentages may not look like \nmuch when you talk about a Medicaid budget, changes in small percentage \npoints have very large financial ramifications. Additional non-state funding is \nneeded due to the planned and anticipated decreases in the federal match rate \nand the States general match rate. When the economy does improve, the State \nmatch rate goes down; the State has to pay more and the federal government \npays  less.  We  will  also  anticipate  changes  in  the  federal  match  rate  for \nnon-enhanced  eligibility  groups,  resulting  in  increases  for  our  need  for \nnon-federal funding. \n \nWe  also  have  challenges  related  to  access.  There  are  health  professional \nshortage areas in all counties of the State. Nevada Medicaid does struggle with \naccess issues, and while those issues impact Medicaid, they are not specific to \nMedicaid.  We  are  looking  forward  to  opportunities  to  address  those  issues. \nSome particular projects have been underway to help us address these access \nissues. We see particular areas of shortage around applied behavioral analysis \nand a lack of behavioral step down facilities in Nevada. Nevada Medicaid is \nworking to fill those gaps by developing new service arrays to help address \nthose  issues.  With  the  lack  of  step  down  facilities,  and  an  overall  lack  of \nproviders  in  the  rural  and  frontier  areas,  we  are  working  on  a  partial \nhospitalization  program  with  some  of  the  State's  federally  qualified  health \ncenters to fill the gap. \n \nThe total Medicaid caseload, which is nearing 700,000, is at 660,456 for 2019. \nThe Nevada Check Up program has an additional 30,000 children enrolled in \nthat program. The majority of our program enrollees are made up of the parents \nand children category at 47 percent with the next largest the newly eligible, or \nMedicaid expansion adults, at 32 percent. The next largest is the aged, blind \nand disabled at 12 percent. Although the parents and children had the most \nenrollees they are not the most expensive population. It is the aged, blind and \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2019 \nPage 9 \n \ndisabled that have a higher per person cost although they are not the bulk of our \nenrollees.  \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nPer the graph on page 13, the aged, blind and disabled caseload category has \nthe highest cost. \n \nMS. BIERMAN: \nAlong with our waiver populations, yes, the aged, blind and disabled caseload \ncategory  has  the  highest  cost  by  caseload  category.  The  waiver  population \nwould be those who would otherwise qualify for institutional levels of support, \nso you can see this category has the highest overall cost. By eligibility category \nit is the aged, blind and disabled, and then newly eligible adults and children \nhave a much lower per person cost. \n \nMARK  KRMPOTIC  (Senate  Fiscal  Analyst,  Fiscal  Analysis  Division,  Legislative \nCounsel Bureau): \nWhen we look at funding levels in State government we look at comparisons to \nwhat the Legislature approved in the previous biennium as a baseline measure. \nThe  handout  provided  for  you  reviews  the  highlights  of  the  Department  of \nHealth  and  Human  Services  Budgets  (Exhibit  E).  The  total  Governor's \nrecommended budget, if you include all funding sources, General Fund, federal \nfunds,  etc.,  totals  about  $25.8  billion,  with  federal  funds  being  the  largest \nportion of that.  \n \nAs shown in the chart on page 2, Health Care Financing and Policy, including \nMedicaid and Nevada Check Up programs, shows an increase of $398 million of \nthe  $527  million  increase.  You  will  also  find  the  other  divisions  and \norganizational  entities  within  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services \nlisted there in terms of General Fund increases. By far, Health Care Financing \nand Policy represents the largest General Fund portion of the increase in General \nFunds on the Governor's recommended budget.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs  it  fair  to  say  that  in  aging  and  disability  services  the  Governor  is \nrecommending  we  invest  an  extra  $63  million  this  year,  and  for  that \n$63 million, what we are able to accomplish are the bullet points you reviewed? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2019 \nPage 10 \n \nMR. KRMPOTIC: \nI  would  characterize  those  as  enhanced  funding  in  the  budget  from  the \nupcoming biennium.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIf we are speaking to the general public, we can state these are areas we are \nincreasing or enhancing our effort. \n \nMR. KRMPOTIC: \nCorrect. \n \nPage 3 of the presentation covers the Division of Health Care and Financing \nPolicy representing primarily a Medicaid program which Ms. Crocket will present \nto you. \n \nCATHY CROCKET  (Senior  Program  Analyst,  Fiscal  Division,  Legislative  Counsel \nBureau): \nThe Division of Health Care Financing and Policy Program (DHCFP) has been \nfairly dynamic in recent years with the implementation of the Affordable Care \nAct (ACA). In fiscal year (FY) 2013, the Medicaid caseload was about 300,000 \nand the total budget was $2 billion per year of which approximately $500,000 \nwas General Fund. By FY 2021 the caseload is projected to be about 677,000. \nThe total budget for that year is recommended to be $5 billion, and of that, \nabout $1 billion would be General Fund. The Medicaid and Nevada Check Up \nprograms, which are administered by the DHCFP, make up a significant portion \nof  the  State  budget.  In  the  upcoming  biennium  they  would  make  up  about \n33 percent of the total State budget at $9.5 billion over the biennium, and \nwould  comprise  approximately  20  percent  of  the  State  total  General  Fund \nexpenditure of $1.8 billion. They would contribute about 64 percent of the total \nfederal funds in the State budget at $6.8 billion of the $10 billion total over the \nbiennium. The DHCFP does account for about 75 percent of the total and about \n60 percent of the General Fund expenditure for the Department of Health and \nHuman Services (DHHS) budget.  \n \nThe costs of Medicaid are generally driven by the number of people served and \nthe cost of serving each person. That varies as the population of the State \ngrows larger. As the economy improves, the increases may be lower. We are \nprojecting an increase for the upcoming biennium even though the economy is \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2019 \nPage 11 \n \ndoing relatively well, and the cost per person of providing services varies based \non trends and utilization.  \n \nSources of funding include federal funds received from the federal government \nwhich are known as Title XIX (Social Security Act) funding and Title XXI (State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program) funds. Local governments do contribute \nfunding to the programs and there is provider tax on long-term care facilities, as \nwell  as  General  Fund  appropriations.  Federal  funds  comprise  approximately \n71 percent  of  the  DHCFP  overall  budget  providing  for  a  portion  of  medical \nservices  and  administrative  costs.  Ms.  Bierman  mentioned  Federal  Medical \nAssistance  Percentage  (FMAP)  rates;  this  is  the  rate  at  which  the  federal \ngovernment provides funding to the State. General Fund and other sources, \nsuch as county contributions, would comprise the rest of medical service and \nadministrative costs.  \n \nFMAP rates are based on eligibility categories; for example, the newly eligible \nhave a certain matching rate where children have a different matching rate. \nAlthough FMAP rates do vary over time, that does not affect the total overall \nrate, but  shifts the cost among the federal government and the State. The \nstandard  FMAP  rate,  which  covers  most  eligibility  groups,  is  determined \nannually and is based on the per capita income of the State relative to other \nstates. If our State is doing relatively well compared to other states, our FMAP \nrate would drop requiring the State to contribute more funding. If it is not doing \nas well, the FMAP rate would rise and the State would contribute less funding. \nCurrently the FMAP rate is approximately 65 percent, which means the federal \ngovernment would contribute 65 percent and the State would contribute the \nremaining 35 percent for the standard FMAP rate. There is the newly eligible \nFMAP  rate  which  covers  the  Medicaid  expansion  population,  the  ACA \npopulation  which  started  at  100 percent  of  federal  funds  when  first \nimplemented in 2014, scaled down slowly until it reaches a floor of 90 percent \nin FY 2021. There is now a temporary increase in effect for the Nevada Check \nUp program that will be sunsetting in FY 2021, decreasing the FMAP rate from \n98 percent to 78 percent federal funds in FY 2021.  \n \nLocal  governments  do  provide  a  good  portion  of  funding  for  a  number  of \nsupplemental  payment  programs  which  are  designed  to  provide  enhanced \nMedicaid  reimbursement  for  certain  service  providers.  They  also  provide  the \nFMAP match for certain participants who are in facilities or on waiver programs, \nknown  as  the  County  Match  Program.  The  local  government  contribution \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2019 \nPage 12 \n \namounts  to  approximately  $375  million  over  the  upcoming  biennium  which \nwould comprise about 3.9 percent of the budget.  \n \nThe  DHCFP  operates  several  supplemental  payment  programs  which  are \nsupported  by  the  local  government.  Supplemental  payments  will  provide \n$765 million  over  the  upcoming  biennium  with  an  additional  reimbursement \nprimarily to hospitals. Local governments do benefit through these programs by \ncontributing the State share of expenditures. They are able to place additional \nfunds  back  into  those  communities  providing  the  local  government  with  a \nbenefit of approximately $430 million over the upcoming biennium. The State \ndoes receive a benefit by generating $98 million through these programs which \nact as a reduction in General Funds to the budget.  \n \nOne  of  the  two  more  significant  supplemental  payment  programs  is  the \nDisproportionate Share Hospital program, also referred to as DSH, designed to \nreimburse hospitals for uncompensated care provided. This is a federal allotment \nspecified  annually  by  the  federal  government.  In  FY  2020-2021,  the \nsupplemental payments to hospitals would be about $74 million in FY 2020, \nand $62 million in FY 2021. The primary beneficiary of this program is the \nUniversity  Medical  Center  in  Las  Vegas.  In  FY  2018  they  received  about \n88 percent of these total supplement payments. There is a provision in the ACA \nand subsequent legislation which will result in these supplemental payments \nreducing significantly. There is a $44 billion decrease scheduled over six years \nwhich will start in FY 2020, having a significant impact on the State and those \nsupplemental payments.  \n \nThe Upper Payment Limit program is the second of the two more significant \nsupplemental payment programs operated by the DHCFP. This program is also \ndesigned to preserve access to care and compensate for uncompensated care. \nThis will allow hospitals to receive a higher level of reimbursements up to the \nMedicare rate, which is known as the Upper Payment Limit. Counties do provide \ntransfers to Medicaid for these programs. The supplemental payments for these \nprograms are budgeted to be $167 million over the upcoming biennium. There is \na Long-Term Care Provider Tax in place, which I believe is 6 percent of net \nrevenues,  which  is  budgeted  to  be  about  $81  million  over  the  upcoming \nbiennium, or about 1 percent of the DHCFP budget. This is used as a match to \nprovide enhanced reimbursement to these same facilities that pay the tax. This \nwill generate approximately $220 million in supplemental payments over the \nupcoming biennium. If there are no other sources of funding available, General \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2019 \nPage 13 \n \nFund makes up the remaining, anticipated to be approximately 19 percent of the \ntotal budget, or $1.8 billion over the upcoming biennium.  \n \nThere is an overall  funding increase totaling $1.2 billion over the upcoming \nbiennium, representing an increase of about 15 percent when compared to the \nfunding  for  the  previous  biennium.  Of  that  increase,  federal  funds  are  an \napproximate  $816  million  increase,  representing  a  14  percent  increase.  The \nGeneral Fund increases about $397 million, representing a 28 percent increase \nfrom  the  last  biennium.  The  overall  increase  is  largely  driven  by  utilization \nchanges,  earlier  referred  to  as  the  cost  per  eligible,  showing  the  cost  of \nproviding care to participants is increasing. There are also caseload increases \nand provider rate increases that drive the overall increase.  \n \nThe caseload for Medicaid is projected to increase by about 1.5 percent per year \nfrom 650,000 people this year to approximately 677,000 by FY 2021. This \nwould require additional funding totaling $139 million of which $51.8 million \nwould be General Fund. There is also a caseload increase projected for the \nNevada Check Up program requiring $5.2 million, of which $600,000 would be \nGeneral  Fund.  That  caseload  of  30,000  children  per  month  is  projected  to \nincrease by about 4 percent.  \n \nThe Governor is also recommending a supplemental appropriation to provide \nfunding for a projected shortfall occurring in this fiscal year, recommended to be \n$14.5 million. The DHCFP typically requests a supplemental appropriation when \ncosts  exceed  what  it  budgeted.  In  2017,  a  supplemental  appropriation  of \n$5.8 million was approved; in 2015 no supplemental appropriation was needed. \nIn 2013 the supplemental appropriation approved was $27 million.  \n \nFederal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) rates vary, having a material \nimpact on the amount of General Fund budgeted. As the rates decline, the State \ncontributes  more  to  operate  the  same  program.  Based  on  an  analysis  put \ntogether  by  the  DHCFP,  $132.6  million  is  associated  with  the  FMAP  rate \nchanges projected over the upcoming biennium. Those rates are projected to be \ndecreasing, and of that total increase, about $84 million of that is associated \nwith the newly eligible population, the Medicaid expansion group. There are \nmandatory  discretionary  and  provider  rate  increases  required  by  the  federal \ngovernment, which the Governor has recommended primarily to increase access \nto care. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2019 \nPage 14 \n \nMandatory  rate  increases  are  projected  to  cost  $346  million,  of  which \n$78 million  would  be  General  Fund.  Those  would  include  managed  care \ncapitation rates, prescription drugs, and federally qualified health centers, which \nare required to have rate increases under federal law.  \n \nThe Governor is recommending several discretionary rate increases, which are \nprojected  to  cost  $49  million  over  the  upcoming  biennium;  approximately \n$12 million in General Fund.  \n \nAlso  recommended  is  an  increase  of  25  percent  to  the  rate  for  neo-natal \nintensive care services, which would cost $25 million; $9 million in General \nFund total. A 15 percent increase for pediatric intensive care services has been \nrecommended, requiring $2.5 million total; $900,000 General Fund.  \n \nA 3.3 percent rate increase is recommended for personal care services at a cost \nof $6 million, of which $2 million would be General Fund.  \n \nAn  increase  is  recommended  for  supportive  living  arrangements  services \nprovided through the Aging and Disability Services Division (ADSD) requiring \nfederal funds within Medicaid and General Funds of $15.2 million which are \nbudgeted in the ADSD budget.  \n \nThere  are  initiatives  recommended  to  expand  access  to  care  in  the \nrecommended budget projected to cost $48.7 million, of which $9.9 million is \nGeneral Fund. The first item relates to an expansion of Certified Community \nBehavioral  Health  Clinics  budgeted  at  $38.9  million  over  the  biennium; \n$8 million  General  Fund  cost.  The  DHCFP  is  projecting  this  would  provide \nservices to 9,200 people per year. There are currently 3 clinics operating under \na pilot program and DHCFP is proposing to expand that number to 10 under \nthe 1115 Demonstration  Waiver,  which  would  allow  the  DHCFP  to  test \ncoverage  for  a  5  year  period.  These  clinics  provide  services  targeted  to \nbehavioral health and substance use disorders. Services include 24 hour crisis \noutpatient  mental  health  and  substance  use  treatment,  as  well  as  case \nmanagement and different recovery supports. I would note at the January 30th \nInterim Finance Committee meeting a work program was approved to allow the \nDHCFP  to  develop  an  application  for  this  waiver.  The  target  to  have  this \ncompleted by July 1, 2019.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2019 \nPage 15 \n \nThere  is  funding  recommended  to  address  housing  instability  through  the \n1915(i)  State  Home  and  Community-Based  Services  Plan,  costing  about \n$9.8 million;  $1.9  million  in  General  Fund.  This  is  intended  to  address \nhomelessness  and  provide  support  for  those  who  are  in  chronic  homeless \nsituations.  \n \nAn additional recommendation in the Governor's budget is to increase county \nsupport for what is referred to as the county match population, which would be \na decrease in General Fund of $19 million over the upcoming biennium, replaced \nwith the corresponding amount in funding contributed by the counties. This \nwould be to revise the methodology for determining the funding split between \nthe State and the counties for certain county match participants. \n \nAdditional General Funds of $31 million were recommended over the biennium \nto reduce Clark County's voluntary contribution in support of the supplemental \npayment programs mentioned earlier.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAre  we  taking  away  $19.2  million  from  the  counties  and  then  giving  them \n$31.1 million? \n \nMS. CROCKET: \nEssentially, yes. I will give a little background on the county match piece. In \n2011, the Legislature approved assigning to counties the financial responsibility \nfor some Medicaid participants, primarily certain waiver participants. By DHHS \ninternal policy, they decided to cap the cost for those assessed to the counties \nat the 2013 level. Over time, as caseloads increase and the cost per person \nincreases, the counties have not been contributing additional funds to cover the \nincreased cost. The county match is recommended to true that, and have the \ncounties  pay  the  non-total,  non-federal  share  for  the  people  for  who  they \ncontribute  support.  That  would  impact  all  counties  throughout  the  State, \nwhereas the Clark County voluntary contribution rate is based on negotiations \nbetween the DHCFP and Clark County, to settle on a rate which the county \nwould  voluntary  contribute  to  these  supplemental  payment  programs. \nSupplemental programs require counties to contribute voluntarily statewide; this \nis what Clark County has decided to contribute and the State has agreed to \nthat. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2019 \nPage 16 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIf I heard correctly, in the place where the cost to counties is going up, the \n$19.2 million will be spread across all counties. In the place where the costs are \ngoing down, only Clark County will benefit. \n \nMS. CROCKET: \nYes, that is correct. \n \nThe final major recommendation relates to waiver slot increases. The DHCFP \noperates  three  waiver  programs  designed  to  keep  people  in  home  and \ncommunity settings rather than institutions. These are operated by the Aging \nand Disability Services Division. The Governor is recommending $68.5 million \ntotal  over  the  biennium,  a  $15.6  million  General  Fund  increase.  This  will \nincrease  waiver  slots  by  27  percent  from  approximately  5,300  people  in \nFY 2019 to 6,700 in FY 2021.  \n \nAs there is an interest in understanding how policy bills that progress through \nthis Committee might have an impact on the budget, I will review a couple of \nthose bills. \n \nSENATE BILL 115: Requires the State Plan for Medicaid to include coverage for \ndonor breast milk. (BDR 38-560) \n \nSenate  Bill  115  has  been  referred  to  this  Committee  requiring  Medicaid  to \ninclude coverage for donor breast milk for certain infants, a policy decision to \nput something in statute to require the DHCFP to put that service in the State \nplan. The DHCFP fiscal note they submitted for that bill indicated the estimated \ncost would be $24.9 million, of which $8.8 million would be General Fund.  \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 116: Provides for an actuarial study to determine the cost of \nrevising certain Medicaid reimbursement rates. (BDR S-702) \n \nThere is also Assembly Bill 116 that has been referred to Assembly Health and \nHuman Services. This would require the DHCFP to conduct an actuarial study to \nexamine the cost of setting Medicaid rates equal to 98 percent of Medicare \nrates. The fiscal impact for that study would be $150,000 added to the DHCFP \nbudget to fund.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2019 \nPage 17 \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 122: Requires the Department of Health and Human Services \nto seek a federal waiver so that certain care for persons who are aged, \ninform or disabled may be included in the State Plan for Medicaid. (BDR \n38-100) \n \nAssembly Bill 122 introduced today and referred to Assembly Health and Human \nServices Division, would require the DHCFP to seek a waiver for certain adult \nday care and respite services. There is no fiscal note released for that as of \ntoday; however, we anticipate that will have a fiscal impact. \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nLooking at the DHHS funds going for Medicaid reimbursement, it seemed to be \ngoing out to primarily one hospital. How do they determine this? Why not do it \nproportionately based on how many Medicaid patients a hospital has? \n \nMS. CROCKET: \nStandard Medicaid reimbursement for services is based on the services that the \nhospitals provide in regard to supplemental payments. There is a formula, an \nadministrative code in statute that determines how that money is distributed. \nThe DHCFP does not have leeway in how the money is distributed under the \nadministrative code for the disproportionate share hospital, for which I referred \nto as the University Medical Center. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWhen it comes to DHCFP, we are spending almost $400 million more, of which \nover a quarter of that is caseload growth and mandatory rate increases in which \nwe do not have a choice. If we are going to maintain the same level of service \nwith the mandatory increases from the federal government, is this money we \nare going to spend right off the bat? \n \nMS. CROCKET: \nCorrect. If you look at the overall increase, I calculate about 80 percent of the \ntotal increase is to continue operating the same program as it is now with \ncaseload increases and FMAP rate changes. I calculate about $321 million of \nthe overall increase is not related to enhancements. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSo 20 percent is enhancements and items we are able to take a step forward \nwith as a State. The larger rate increases are targeted toward Medicaid billable \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2019 \nPage 18 \n \nexpenses; NICU, service level agreements and new initiatives. Particularly the \nCertified Community Behavioral Health Care clinics and the 1915(i) State Plan \nHome and Community-Based Service waivers of behavioral health are getting an \ninvestment.  The  waiver  slot  increases  in  the  Home  and  Community-Based \nwaivers and the Frail Elderly are so we can reduce those waiting lists, is that \ncorrect?  \n \nMS. CROCKET: \nYes, that is correct. \n \nMR. KRMPOTIC: \nWe  have  additional  bullets,  shown  in  Exhibit  E,  starting  on  page  4  of  the \nhandout,  completing  on  page  5,  relating  to  the  remaining  divisions  of  the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, the Welfare and Supportive Services \nDivision and the Division of Child and Family Services. \n \nThe money Committees will be deliberating on each of these recommendations \nand enhancements, and over the next three months they will likely change. \nStaff also work with the DHCFP to update the caseload projections that are \nincluded in the Governor's recommended budget to include more months of \nactual  experience,  including  the  most  accurate  and  up-to-date  caseload \nprojections in the budget. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nKeeping an eye on caseload projections is big for the next three months. You \nmade a comment about when the economy is doing better we would typically \nexpect to see less caseload, less usage of some of our programs across the \nboard, but we are not necessarily seeing that in this economy. Is that a new \ndisconnect  between  economic  prosperity  and  the  amount  of  those  needing \nservices? \n \nMR. KRMPOTIC: \nI  would  say  that  in  the  Temporary  Assistance  for  Needy  Families  (TANF) \nprogram you would see caseload decrease, not dramatically, but the trend has \nbeen  downward;  that  is  the  Welfare  Cash  Assistance  Program.  In  the \nSupplemental  Nutrition  Assistance  Program  (SNAP),  I  do  not  have  those \ncaseload projections with me; however, they would not necessarily impact the \nbudget as SNAP benefits are paid directly from the federal government to the \nrecipients. I believe those caseloads may have been leveling off. Ms. Crocket \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2019 \nPage 19 \n \nalso indicated the Medicaid caseloads have also leveled off. We are watching \nthe caseloads in relation to the economy and there are increases in various areas \nand this is not always easy to explain. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI am stunned each time I hear the statistic that 56 percent of the children born \nin Nevada are born on Medicaid. We all know the poverty level at which you \nhave to live to qualify for Medicaid is relatively low. I believe it is helpful for us \nto keep in mind that during a time when we are seeing increased economic \nprosperity and wage growth, still in the State of Nevada, 56 percent is well over \nhalf of the children in Nevada born on Medicaid. That is a daunting number and \nprobably an indicator of many other things.  \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI think Ms. Bierman reflected on social indicators and the connection it has, \npossibly  as  some  of  the  wages  and  prosperities  rise.  We  have  looked  at \nunaffordability of housing and we still have a growing wage gap. In my mind \nthere are some social factors that are inextricably collocated with what we are \ntrying to do with health care, particularly for children and our most vulnerable \npopulations. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will open it up for public comment. \n \nVIVIAN LEAL: \nWritten testimony read (Exhibit F). \n \nMYLAN HAWKING: \nWritten testimony read (Exhibit G). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2019 \nPage 20 \n \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSeeing no further comments, we are adjourned at 5:13 p.m. \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nVickie Polzien, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2019 \nPage 21 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nExhibit / \nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \n# of pages \n  A  1    Agenda \n  B  5    Attendance Roster \nSteve Fisher, Deputy \nAdministrator, Program and \nPresentation on the Division \nField Operations, Division of \n  C  14  of Welfare and Supportive \nWelfare and Supportive \nServices \nServices, Department of \nHealth and Human Services \nSuzanne Biermann, \nAdministrator, Division of  Presentation on the Division \n  D  15  Health Care Financing and  of Health Care Financing and \nPolicy  Policy \n \nMark Krmpotic, Senate  Description of Department of \n  E  5  Fiscal Analyst, Fiscal  Health and Human Services \nAnalysis Division, LCB  Budgets \n  F  2  Vivian Leal  Testimony \n  G  2  Mylan Hawkins  Testimony \n \n \n ", "11": "\nMINUTES OF THE  \nSENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n \nEightieth Session \nFebruary 13, 2019 \n \n \nThe Senate Committee on Health and Human Services was called to order by \nChair Julia Ratti at 4:08 p.m. on Wednesday, February 13, 2019, in Room 2149 \nof  the  Legislative  Building,  Carson City,  Nevada.

(BDR 38-200) \n \nSTEVE  FISHER  (Administrator,  Division  of  Welfare  and  Supportive  Services, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nI  will  have  Ms.  Murray  provide  a  high  level  overview  of  the  Child  Support \nEnforcement Program, followed by the introduction of S.B. 17 and then we are \nprepared to answer any questions.  \n \nNOVA  MURRAY  (Deputy  Administrator,  Division  of  Welfare  and  Supportive \nServices, Department of Health and Human Services): \nThe Child Support Enforcement Program (CSEP) currently has 89,000 cases, \nwhich is about 1.6 percent of Nevada's population. Of those cases, 50,000 are \nin arrears by more than $500. In 2018, the CSEP collected $221 million for \nNevada families. The CSEP has five basic services: locating parents; establishing \npaternity; establishing financial and medical support; collecting and distributing \nthe  collections;  and  enforcement.  Federal  law  requires  that  states  have \nprocesses  for  withholding  and  suspending  professional,  occupational  and \nrecreational licenses. The bill comes forward as a coordinated effort through \nstrategic planning between State staff and nine participating counties. There \nhas been three years of hard work toward the passage of this legislation. This \nbill will provide support for children with noncustodial parents. This will help \nNevadans  achieve  safe,  stable  and  healthy  lives.  These  collaborative  efforts \nhave taken the program from 52nd in the nation where it was 10 years ago, to \n25th in 2016. Unofficially, we have heard that CSEP may hit 13th in 2017. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 13, 2019 \nPage 3 \n \nPursuant to federal mandate, existing law authorizes the Nevada Department of \nWildlife (NDOW), upon receipt of a court order, to suspend a recreational license \nfor noncompliance with a child support obligation. This effective enforcement \nremedy is not being used based on the level of effort required to execute the \nprocess. It currently requires staff, State and county attorneys to obtain a court \norder.  Additionally,  it  places  a  burden  on  the  already  overburdened  court \nsystem. \n \nThe  CSEP  could  solve  this  by  supplanting  the  judicial  process  with  an \nadministrative law that alleviates the workload from the court system, as well \nas the county and State staff. This would provide a more effective enforcement \nremedy resulting in an increase of child support collections for Nevada families. \nThe elimination of the six month exemption, when appropriate, helps remedy a \ngreater number of cases. So S.B. 17 seeks to strengthen the efficiency and \nefficacy of our current enforcement remedy for nonpayment of court ordered \nchild support obligations. It also removes the requirement for district courts to \nissue an order providing for the suspension of recreational licenses, such as \nhunting or fishing, held by a person who is in arrears on their child support. This \nwill reduce the burden on court resources and associated program staff and \nattorneys.  It  establishes  an  administrative  process,  initiated  by  CSEP  for \nsuspending recreational licenses due to noncompliance. This process parallels \nthe current driver's license process that has been in effect for about 22 years. It \nalso  allows  for  due  process,  which  is  given  to  all  clients.  It  removes  the \nprovision of an existing law prohibiting the suspension of recreational licenses \nthat expire less than six months after the license is issued. It authorizes NDOW \nto suspend recreational licenses on notice of receipt from CSEP after the 30 day \ncontested period elapses. It provides for the reinstatement of the recreational \nlicenses  when  NDOW  is  notified.  The  bill  expedites  the  license  suspension \nprocess, which will result in increased child support collections to families. This \nexisting law was passed over 20 years ago when there was not a centralized \ndatabase. We believe that is why the six month provision was there, to allow \nextra  time  to  put  something  in  effect.  The  goal  of  this  suspension  is  not \nnecessarily  to  be  punitive,  but  rather  get  the  attention  of  nonpayers  and \nencourage regular payments from those individuals.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nCould taking away a fishing license also take away someone's livelihood? Do \nthe district attorneys know about this? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 13, 2019 \nPage 4 \n \nMS. MURRAY: \nThe district attorneys are aware of this. This is a collaborative effort between \nCSEP, the district attorneys and other stakeholders. This has been an effective \nremedy nationwide and other states use this. We would have to ask NDOW \nhow they feel about taking away someone's livelihood. We just want to get the \nnonpayers attention.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nHas someone done a study and can prove this works?  \n \nDAVID CASTAGNOLA (Social Services Program Specialist, Division of Welfare and \nSupportive Services, Department of Health and Human Services): \nThe requirement to suspend recreational licenses is a federal mandate of all child \nsupport programs. Within the western states that have large outdoor recreation-\noriented venues, this program has proven to be effective. Based on statistics \nfrom the NDOW website, over 150,000 licensing privileges a year are issued. \nThat is a large segment of the population. Outdoor recreation including hunting \nand fishing, is a multi-million dollar a year industry. The people CSEP is targeting \nare not subsistence living by hunting and fishing. They are not hunting and \nfishing to put food on the table. They are people who are spending a large \namount of money each year to buy a variety of hunting licenses and tags. If we \nsuspend that, it hits them in the pocketbook. This will get their attention much \nthe  same  way  as  the  suspension  of  professional,  occupational  and  driver's \nlicenses. Nevada has State child support offices and nine district attorneys who \nparticipate in the child support program. There are ways to get back the license \nafter it has been suspended. They can pay their arrearage in full, or enter into a \nrepayment  agreement  with  the  enforcing  authority.  If  they  enter  into  a \nrepayment agreement, they pay something less than the full amount in monthly \ninstallments and their license will be reinstated. They have the ability to request \na court hearing if they disagree with the amount of arrearage that CSEP believes \nis owed. Due process is there. We are not trying to penalize people who are \nputting food on the table. These are people with disposable income who are not \npaying their child support.  \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nNothing would make me happier than to see people who are not paying child \nsupport, pay the necessary support for their children. I notice there is quite a \nlengthy process before suspension. I see that you can suspend or revoke a \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 13, 2019 \nPage 5 \n \nlicense, but is there a process to block them from getting a license? What is the \nprocess for reinstating the license?  \n \nMS. MURRAY: \nWe are working on a new database that will automate this process. I hope this \nwill  allow  NDOW  to  be  able  to  take  that  action  before  they  apply  for  a \nrecreational license. This would mean that something would have to exist on \ntheir end. We may want to ask NDOW.  \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nI leave that question for them when they testify. It looks like reinstatement \nhappens when you sit down in a meeting. Let us say that you do not have a \nmeeting, but you do pay whatever your arrears were. Is there a mechanism or \ntrigger that says now you can be reinstated?  \n \nMS. MURRAY: \nCurrently that process is not automated, but it will be automated in the future. \nAs we put the process in place to suspend that license, we would also keep \nrecords of the people we have suspended through our system as they pay their \narrears, even if they do not have a meeting. Once they have paid back their \narrearage,  we  would  send  a  notification  to  the  NDOW  to  release  that \nsuspension.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nDue process, does it happen before or after the suspension?  \n \nMR. CASTAGNOLA: \nThe due process opportunity comes before the suspension. The license holder is \nnotified, and they are given a period to contest and request a court hearing. \nThere is the due process. Prior to going to court, there is a requirement to meet \nwith the enforcing authority to try to reach an agreement without the need to \ngo to court. There is notice, opportunity for discussion and an opportunity for a \ncourt  hearing.  If  there  is  no  resolution,  then  and  only  then,  is  the  license \nsuspended. There is a separate statute that this bill does not touch. This statute \nrequires applicants to disclose at the time of application for a license whether \nthey are subject to a child support order and if they are in compliance with that \norder. That statute provides for withholding the license and not issuing it if the \nindividual is not in compliance.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 13, 2019 \nPage 6 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nLet us get some technical questions answered as to how this will interface with \nNDOW, and then we will open it up for testimony.  \n \nJACK ROBB (Deputy Director, Nevada Department of Wildlife): \nThe NDOW has on an annual basis, about 89,000 hunting license holders and \n140,000 fishing license holders. We have about 70,000 people apply for the big \ngame draw and 30,000 people draw those tags. We send out questionnaires to \nthe 30,000 people who drew those tags. These questions might be, did they \nhunt,  did  they  harvest,  and  if  they  did  harvest,  what  date.  If  they  do  not \nrespond to the texts, emails, and postcards, they get suspended. To clear that \nsuspension, they have to pay a $50 fine. This year, NDOW has about 2 percent \nof these people who are in suspension status. The big game draw applications \nstart March 18th of this year and that 2 percent are on the sidelines until they \npay up. We are used to having suspensions, clearing suspensions and getting \npeople  back  into  the  field.  There  will  not  be  a  revenue  impact  to  NDOW, \nbecause we have already sold that license. They have the privilege of having \nthat  license  and  we  will  not  reimburse  anybody  who  has  had  their  license \nsuspended.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI still have some questions about due process. For example, someone puts in for \na bighorn sheep tag. As I understand it, NDOW is not prescreening anyone on \nthis particular issue, so this person would be in the pool. Let us say, they are \nawarded a tag and at that point the NDOW database would be matched with \nthe child support database. At this point, they would have the opportunity to go \nthrough the due process steps. They would get notices, they would get the \nopportunity to have a meeting, and in that meeting the child support issue can \nbe resolved without the need for court. If it gets resolved NDOW gets a notice \nfrom the CSEP that this person is cleared. If it does not get resolved, then he or \nshe still has a bighorn sheep tag up until the court date and the judge could say \npull the tags. Is that how it works?  \n \nMR. ROBB: \nCurrently, NDOW does not have the ability to prescreen. Bonus points are a big \nthing for Nevada hunters. It gives them a better chance of getting a bighorn \nsheep tag. The NDOW could provide a database of who has the most bonus \npoints and had a hunting license last year. Our licenses are good for 365 days \nfrom  date  of  purchase.  Maybe  we  could  start  the  database  on  last  year's \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 13, 2019 \nPage 7 \n \nhunting license, because it has not expired. There is a way to prescreen and \nnotify a person that may draw the bighorn sheep tag.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI want complete transparency. The draw is in March; when will you know you \nhave been drawn? \n \nMR. ROBB: \nThe application period is March 18 to April 29, 2019. The draw occurs May 22, \n2019. The results are sent out May 24, 2019. The hunting season for desert \nbighorn sheep opens November 20, 2019. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThey would have from May until hunting season opened in November to resolve \nthis issue, is that correct? \n \nMR. ROBB: \nWe could start this process as soon this bill passes.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIf they are a new person applying, they would still have five to six months to \nresolve this? \n \nMR. ROBB: \nYes that is correct. \n \nMS. MURRAY: \nWhen  the  data  match  is  done  by  the  CSEP,  the  CSEP  queries  the  NDOW \ndatabase. The CSEP or the district attorney's office will deal with the person in \narrears. We work on the due process and the meeting. Not until the person has \nfailed to get through that due process is NDOW notified.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAs a matter of privacy, no one at NDOW will even know about this until they \nhave had a court date and the arrears have not been resolved. Is that correct? \n \nMS. MURRAY: \nIt would not have to necessarily go to the court date. It could be the person did \nnot respond to the CSEP. Then we would notify NDOW to suspend the license.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 13, 2019 \nPage 8 \n \n \nCHET VAN DELLEN (Division Administrator, Nevada Department of Wildlife): \nI want to give you a quick overview of the NDOW suspension process. We have \nbeen working with the CSEP for many years. We get the suspension request \nfrom  CSEP  and  NDOW  puts  a  suspension  on  your  record.  That  suspension \ninvalidates any current recreational licenses you may have with NDOW, such as \nhunting, fishing or trapping. You are then blocked from any future sales of \nrecreational licenses until the suspension is lifted. Those suspensions have a \nbeginning and an end date. If there is a termination date that is known, NDOW \nsets that and the suspension will automatically clear itself. Or NDOW can set \nthat suspension as indefinite, and it would be cleared manually on request from \nthe CSEP.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSo the person has a license and they are stopped by law enforcement. The \nlicense is run, would they know that license is suspended?  \n \nMr. Van Dellen: \nYes they would. What NDOW would do in cases like this, we would provide a \nreport to our law enforcement division. It would contain anyone who has a \ncurrent  suspension  and  was  issued  a  license  prior  to  that  suspension.  Law \nenforcement would know if this person is on this list; they should not be out \nusing  that  privilege.  In  addition,  if  the  NDOW  database  was  queried,  there \nwould be an alert on that person's record stating that they are suspended and \nthey should not be out in the field acting on any of those privileges that have \nbeen revoked.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI just want to confirm this. Nevada is federally mandated to do this. Nevada is \ndoing this now. The NDOW and CSEP have a working relationship; however, the \nprocess is cumbersome. This bill will make this an administrative process and \nthere  is  new  technology  to  further  streamline  the  process.  Ultimately,  you \nexpect revenues to increase dramatically. Is that a fair summary? \n \nMS. MURRAY: \nYou are correct.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 13, 2019 \nPage 9 \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nIt sounds like the technology is almost there. As I understand it, your agencies \nare still trying to interface or are you able to interface now? \n \nMS. MURRAY: \nWe do have a process in place. It is not as robust as we would like it. The CSEP \nwill develop that process. We have started what we are calling the NVKIDS \nproject.  It  will  replace  the  current  child  support  database.  This  project  will \nautomate  the  process.  Currently  we  have  a  semi-automated  process.  It  is \ndifficult because we have to get the court order and the return on investment is \nnot good. If we were administrative, it would not be so cumbersome to get a \ncourt order.  \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nSo when do you feel you will have as you say, a robust system? \n \nMS. MURRAY: \nI think the best case scenario will be through the new child support system, \nwhich will be completed in 2022. If S.B. 17 passes, we will work with NDOW \nto have something that functions better than our current process. We will make \nthis an easier process, which will be less burdensome for counties and State \nstaff.  \n \nCHAIR RATT: \nIs our federal funding at risk? \n \nMS. MURRAY: \nOur federal funding is always at risk when we do not follow regulations. I truly \nfeel that we are following regulations by having a process in place. I think we \ncould have a better regulation that would make what we have more effective. I \ncould not swear that we are doing our best if this regulation is not changed. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN:  \nThe regulations are in place, because when children are denied the support that \nthey should have, the taxpayers have to pick up the difference. This regulation \nprotects children, is that correct? \n \nMS. MURRAY: \nYou are correct.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 13, 2019 \nPage 10 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe will open the meeting for support testimony. \n \nJOHN JONES (Nevada District Attorneys Association): \nI am here on behalf of the Nevada District Attorneys Association. We support \nS.B. 17. \n  \nJEFF WITTHUN (Director, District Attorney Family Support Division, Clark County): \nI have been the Clark County District Attorney, Family Support Division Director \nfor the past three and a half years. Before that, I was the Assistant Director for \nfive and a half years. Before that, I worked in the State of Wisconsin Child \nSupport System as an attorney for ten years. I was also the President of the \nWisconsin  Child  Support  Association.  Wisconsin  has  a  robust  recreational \nlicense suspension program. I am able to tell you that if you have a statute that \nworks, this program is very persuasive and effective. It gets people who hunt \nand fish to pay their child support.  \n \nI am also the Director of the National Child Support Enforcement Association's \nBoard of Directors in Washington, D.C. I am familiar with the program from a \nnational  level.  I  support  amending  Nevada  Revised  Statutes (NRS)  through \nS.B. 17. The 42 U.S. Code 666 gives child support programs across the country \nvarious tools, such as this recreational license suspension. The purpose of those \ntools and mandating that they be put in place, is to increase the effectiveness of \nthe child support program. The U.S. Code is where these tools are given, as \nwell as the mandate. Unfortunately, current Nevada law is based entirely on a \ncourt process and six month restriction on what are often yearlong licenses and \nhas made the tool unusable at the district attorney and county child support \nagency level. Even if you did happen to find someone who had such a license \nand had not paid their arrears, by the time you got them through the court \nprocess and complying, they would be in the last six months of their license \ntime-line and you could not suspend it. Therefore, we have not used what in my \npast experience is a very effective tool in terms of collecting child support.  \n \nDeputy Administrator Murray did a great job outlining the fact that over the last \neight or ten years, Nevada's child support program as a whole has done a much \nbetter  job  at  bringing  in  child  support  for  children  and  families.  We  should \nremove  the  six  month  restriction  and  put  the  responsibility  on  the  district \nattorney's local offices. The courts do not know when someone is in arrears \nunless we tell them there is someone in arrears. We have the child support \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 13, 2019 \nPage 11 \n \nsystem right in front of us. It is best to burden us to utilize this tool. We \ncertainly have the capability to do that. I can testify that from my standpoint, \nClark County  has  59%  of  the  entire  State  child  support  caseload,  with \napproximately 52,000 of the 88,000 cases. I believe if we can do it, the other \nlocal offices can do it. We are prepared to move forward.  \n \nI think it is important for all of us to remember that most of our cases are low to \nmiddle income class families. Many of them are on public assistance who need \ntheir child support. In my opinion, the purpose of this program and why we exist \nis because child support supports our children. I think this comes first before \nsomeone is allowed to spend money for a recreational license to hunt or fish. I \nthink taking care of one's children is a higher priority for the future of our \ncommunity. I support this bill. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWhat you are describing is a due process that happens afterward. The due \nprocess takes longer and it appears the due process is bypassed. We have given \nnotice to the person and they can say I want due process, but we have already \ntaken their license. Did I understand that correctly? \n \nMR. WITTHUN: \nWhat we are trying to do is remove the six month prohibition and this process \nbecomes administrative. The district attorney's local child support offices are \nbetter equipped to identify the fact there is a case where someone is not paying \ntheir child support. From that point the person is going to get due process. If the \ncase is selected and we see that they have a recreational license, a letter would \nbe sent to them and state, you are behind on your arrears, you need to make \npayments, please contact us. You have the right at this time to request a court \nhearing. Before the court hearing, we would like to meet with you and try to \nresolve this issue and come to some sort of payment agreement. They are \ngiving both of those options in the original letter. Whether they choose to meet \nwith us or not, they still have the right to that hearing. The NDOW is not even \naware we have them and may be seeking a suspension. The goal is not to take \ntheir license. Our goal is to create a compliant child support payer, based on \ntheir orders and ability to pay. They could resolve this in our office and the \ncourts  are  not  involved.  If  they  do  not  resolve  this  through  a  repayment \nagreement in our office and they want their due process hearing, then they get \nto go to court. The court would then make the determination whether they are \nin arrears and have not been paying. At that point, they have an additional \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 13, 2019 \nPage 12 \n \n30 days to comply and if they do not comply, we would let NDOW know. We \nhave been through the process, here is the court order. Or if they chose to not \ndeal  with  us  at  all,  and  those  30  days  have  expired,  then  we  would  seek \nsuspension. They have gotten the due process upfront in every case.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe will close the hearing for S.B. 17 and open the hearing for S.B. 18. \n \nSENATE BILL 18: Revises provisions relating to persons with intellectual and \ndevelopmental disabilities. (BDR 39-198) \n \nDENA SCHMIDT (Administrator, Aging and Disability Services Division, Department \nof Health and Human Services): \nThis bill will revise the certification and audit process for the Jobs and Day \nTraining  (JDT)  providers.  Currently  providers  are  required  to  submit  annual \naudits of their financial status, prepared by an independent CPA along with \nmultiple  other  documents,  including  tax  returns.  These  requirements  are  an \nadministrative  burden  for  many  of  our  providers  and  they  disproportionately \nimpact our small providers. By removing the financial review requirements from \nthe NRS, this will allow the Aging and Disability Services Division (ADSD) to \nprovide a certification policy, which would outline what documents are required. \nThis will allow us to develop policies that address the variations and sizes of our \nproviders in accordance with their business model, while still ensuring financial \nstability, solvency and protecting State interests. We are by no means trying to \nreduce  the  certification  and  audit  process;  we  are  making  them  more \nappropriate based on the size of the provider.  \n \nJobs  and  Day  Training  is  provided  by  contract  providers  in  the  community. \nThese services are individually based and developed through a person-centered \nprocess, with a desired outcome of completing employment in the community. \nCurrently, as the ADSD moves to person-centered planning, we have the ability \nto create opportunities that are based on an individual's needs rather than large \ngroup settings. We are looking at opportunities where a provider could serve \njust one or two recipients. This will give us some monitoring flexibility and allow \nus to encourage more opportunities, especially in our rural communities. The \nchanges are in NRS 435.227. This is where we are changing the language to \nallow it to be in policy.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 13, 2019 \nPage 13 \n \nThe second provision in this bill removes the term, \"developmental disability\", \nfrom NRS 435.365. This particular section is related to our Family Preservation \nProgram (FPP). This is a clean-up of an inadvertent change created by Assembly \nBill (A.B.) 224 of the 79th Session, which updated the language throughout the \nchapter. What that bill did was remove the term and other related conditions \nand replaced it with the term, \"developmental disabilities\". Unfortunately FPP is \na  very  small  and  distinct  program  that  has  always  served  individuals  with \nintellectual  disabilities  only.  The  FPP  provides  monthly  financial  aid  to  low \nincome  families  who  care  for  relatives  in  their  home;  who  have  severe  or \nprofound intellectual disabilities or have a child under the age of six who has a \ndevelopmental delay; who require the support equivalent to that of a person \nwith a severe or profound intellectual disability.  \n \nI think there has been some misunderstanding. The ADSD has received some \nfeedback regarding this change. This is not a change that reduces the benefit \nfor this program in any way. It really is just language clean-up. I am not a \nclinician, but as I understand, there is no such thing as a diagnosis as a severe \nor  profound  developmental  disability.  I  have  Dr.  Brown  with  me  to  walk \neveryone through the difference and why that is not an actual diagnosis.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI would like clarification on that. It is my understanding this language change \nmade in 2017 was not just applied to this program, but it was across the board \nin statute. Why are you asking for the change in this particular program and not \nall of the programs that were affected in 2017?  \n \nMS. SCHMIDT: \nWhen the language was changed in all of our programs in 2017, the intent was \nto  clarify  the  term  and  change  it  to  developmental  disability.  Most  of  our \nprograms do serve both populations and diagnosis. The FPP has never served \nindividuals  with  developmental  disabilities.  It  has  always  been  a  program \nfocused on intellectual disabilities.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAll of the other programs included that language and you are okay with that? \n \nMS. SCHMIDT: \nThat is correct.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 13, 2019 \nPage 14 \n \nELAINE  BROWN,  PH.D.  (Licensed  Psychologist,  Aging  and  Disability  Services \nDivision, Department of Health and Human Services): \nAs was mentioned, prior to the language change this program served individuals \nwith an intellectual disability or a related condition, who also had a diagnosis of \na severe or profound intellectual disability. What that means is this program has \nalways  served  individuals  who  may  have  other  conditions,  such  as  Down \nsyndrome, cerebral palsy, epilepsy and autism, if that family member also has a \nsevere  or  profound  intellectual  disability.  The  program  provides  financial \nassistance that allows the child or adult to remain in their family home instead \nof  an  institution.  With  the  change  from  related  condition  to  developmental \ndisability, the program would be serving an individual with profound or severe \nintellectual  disability  or  profound  or  severe  developmental  disability  as  a \ndiagnosis, whereas, we have always maintained that the individual child and \nadult have that diagnosis. The World Health Organization Centers for Disease \nControl  and  Prevention  continued  to  look  at  the  prevalence  of  severe  or \nprofound intellectual disability for all of these conditions and for all of the other \ndevelopmental disabilities. The reason for this is a person, child or adult who \nhas that diagnosis is fully dependent for all aspects of daily life. There is no \nintent  to  change  the  program,  only  to  clean  up  the  language  around  the \ndiagnosis of severe or profound intellectual disability. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI am looking at the language of the bill. The bill states before the change a \nperson with an intellectual disability has been diagnosed as having a profound or \nsevere intellectual disability or developmental disability. You are saying there is \nno such thing as a profound or severe developmental disability, is that correct? \n \nDR. BROWN: \nA diagnosis of severe or profound developmental disability is correct. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI need some clarification. During the 2017 Session, I believe this is the language \nthat was changed in all of the sections. Do the other sections refer to someone \nwho has been diagnosed with a profound or severe developmental disability? \n \nMS. SCHMIDT: \nThis program serves severe or profound intellectual disabilities. All the other \nprograms serve intellectual disabilities and developmental disabilities. This is the \nonly program that requires the severe or profound diagnosis.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 13, 2019 \nPage 15 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThis is the only program that has the severe or profound language? All of the \nother  programs  have  the  full  category  of  intellectual  disabilities  and \ndevelopmental disabilities and you are okay with that? \n \nMS. SCHMIDT: \nYes we are okay with that and that is correct. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nSo somebody who has been getting assistance now is going to be left out, and \nwho are those people? \n \nMS. SCHMIDT: \nThe program continues to serve the same population, so nobody would be left \nout. The FPP continues to serve the same population since it was developed in I \nbelieve, 1981. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI am not interested in everybody, I am interested in the individuals who would \nnot be helped who are being helped right now. Is there an individual who is not \ngoing to be covered by the FPP, who is now covered?  \n \nMS. SCHMIDT: \nThis language clarification will not affect any individual person in the program.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWill it affect the families? \n \nMS. SCHMIDT: \nNo, it will not impact them. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs that true, because we did not expand the population after the language was \nchanged  in  2017  to  include  folks  with  developmental  disabilities?  Had  we \nfollowed the letter of the law, would we have expanded the population? \n \nDR. BROWN: \nThe  term  intellectual  developmental  disability  replaced  the  term  related \ncondition.  So  prior,  a  person  could  have  an  intellectual  disability  or  related \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 13, 2019 \nPage 16 \n \ncondition,  and  if  they  had  a  diagnosis  of  severe  or  profound  intellectual \ndisability, then they are eligible for the program. The language change in 2017 \ndid not impact that, in terms that we still had individuals with intellectual or \ndevelopmental disabilities eligible for the program. The criteria is that you have a \ndiagnosis of severe or profound intellectual disability. The person can also have \nany  other  developmental  disability  and  a  diagnosis  of  severe  or  profound \nintellectual disability.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI:  \nI want to make sure we are  understanding this. Prior to  2017, the statute \napplied  to  a  person  with  a  profound  intellectual  disability  and  a  related \ncondition, and now it applies to a person with a profound intellectual disability \nand a developmental disability. \n \nDR. BROWN: \nIt used to state, an intellectual disability or a related condition. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSo it stated \"or\" a related condition meaning that prior to 2017, to be included \nin this program, it could be somebody with a profound intellectual disability or \nsomebody with a related condition. Is that correct? \n \nMS. SCHMIDT: \nIf you continue in that section, it states they have to live with a parent and the \nperson with the intellectual disability has been diagnosed as having a profound \nand severe intellectual disability. I believe it is clarified language. So what we \nare saying is there is no severe or profound developmental disability. A person \nwith  a  severe  or  profound  intellectual  disability  may  have  a  developmental \ndisability  or  any  other  variation.  If  you  look  back  to  A.B.  224  of  the \n79th Session, changing the term \"related condition\" changed this program and \nthat  was  not  the  intent  of  the  bill.  There  was  no  intention  to  change  this \nprogram to serve additional populations that it was not previously serving.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWhen we say, \"or a person with a developmental disability,\" that was put in on \npurpose because we wanted to expand. Is there anybody who is going to be left \nout? Are we leaving out people who we intended to be included, but were not \nadded,  because  the  definition  does  not  exist?  Our  intent  was  to  include \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 13, 2019 \nPage 17 \n \ndevelopmental disability, in addition to what was already covered. So this was \nnot accomplished, is that correct? \n \nMS. SCHMIDT: \nI will have to say this is not the Legislature's mistake, this was our mistake for \nnot catching it. We did not correct the language change during the last session. \nI believe if the intent was to expand this program we would have clarified that \nduring that process. This would have been part of the record. This program was \ncreated for a very specific population. During the hearings for A.B. 224 of the \n79th Session, there was no discussion of expanding this particular program to a \nnew population that had not previously been served.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI want to make sure we get this right. We will spend some time outside of this \nmeeting to make sure we have some clarity. I would like to open this meeting \nfor testimony in support of S.B. 18. \n \nTRACY BROWN-MAY (Director of Advocacy, Board, and Government Relations, \nOpportunity Village):  \nThere  are  two  separate  provisions  within  S.B.  18  that  you  are  considering \ntoday. We are here in support of the first provision. I will be happy to discuss \nthe  second  provision.  I  appreciate  your  line  of  questions  as  we  had  similar \nquestions.  \n \nThe first provision is relative to administrative oversight and financial documents \nthat are requested of JDT providers. Opportunity Village is one of southern \nNevada's largest providers of JDT services. We currently serve about 1,100 \npeople who have either intellectual and/or developmental disabilities. We are \nconstantly working to improve supports and services to be able to deliver people \nindividualized service. The provision that is currently in this section of the NRS \nis specific to nonprofits. It is not relative to a for-profit organization trying to \nprovide JDT services. We congratulate ADSD for eliminating a provision that \nwas onerous. We also believe in supporting other nonprofit organizations that \nprovide individualized JDT services. We offer our support on behalf of the first \nprovision.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDo you have concerns about the second provision? Do you want to get some of \nyour questions on the record? \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 13, 2019 \nPage 18 \n \nMS. BROWN-MAY: \nI  understand  the  language  change  is  relative  to  the  Family  First  Prevention \nServices Act. We do a lot of work with the American Association on Intellectual \nand Developmental Disabilities. The entire section of NRS 435 is really specific \nin regard to support and services provided to both folks who have intellectual \nand developmental disabilities. Any time we have a change in language, it would \nprimarily be diagnostic. I am not a doctor, so I would look to Senator Hardy and \nother professionals in that area. But if we pull back who are providing supports \nand services for us that is always concerning. This is one small provision in \nNRS 435, so our immediate concern is we would change the language for the \nrest of the provisions in that section. We would like to see clarification knowing \nthat  any  proposed  change  would  be  specific  to  that  program.  Opportunity \nVillage and the folks that we support are not aware of anyone utilizing those \nfunds. We understand that they are a small part in the budget.  \n \nBART VANDAME (Director, Going Places): \nI am a small provider in northern Nevada called Going Places. I am in support of \nthe first provision of S.B. 18. I am in favor of not having to do the audits and \nsupply documents. For small providers, it is cumbersome to annually go through \nthis process. The only question I would have is why is this only directed to the \nJDT  and  not  the  Supported  Living  Arrangement  (SLA)  program?  I  provide \nsupport to both.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI do want to note for the record that we have received written testimony from \nSteve Cohen (Exhibit C) in opposition to S.B. 18. It is available on the Nevada \nElectronic  Legislative  Information  System  (NELIS)  and  will  be  noted  in  the \nminutes.  \n \nI would like to call ADSD back up and ask them why S.B. 18 only applies to the \nJDT program and not the SLA program. \n \nJESSICA ADAMS (Health Program Manager, Aging and Disability Services Division, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nThe reason this applies only to the JDT program is this is the only part of the \nNRS that it is in. This is not part of the NRS for our SLA programs; those are all \npart of our standards for certification. The standards for certification cover how \nmuch a provider has to make in order to get an audit done. This is something \nthat we are looking at and working with our provider groups so that it makes \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 13, 2019 \nPage 19 \n \nmore sense for people and we are not requiring burdensome processes. This bill \nonly has to do with JDT, because SLA does not exist in this portion of NRS.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSo  the  audit  does  not  exist  in  the  SLA,  but  there  are  other  certification \nrequirements.  If  you  are  an  SLA  provider  there  are  other  certification \nrequirements  that  may  feel  similar  to  the  process  requirements  of  the  JDT \nprogram. Currently, you are reviewing that process to see if you are setting it at \nthe right level to be appropriate.  \n \nMS. ADAMS: \nThat is correct.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe are going to close the hearing for S.B. 18. Is there any public comment? \nSeeing none, we are adjourned at 5:13 p.m. \n \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nMichelle Hamilton, \nCommittee Secretary \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 13, 2019 \nPage 20 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nExhibit / \nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \n# of pages \n  A  1    Agenda \n  B  5    Attendance Roster \nSteven Cohen / Private  Written Testimony Steve \nS.B. 18  C  3 \nCitizen  Cohen (S.B. 18) \n ", "12": "\nMINUTES OF THE  \nSENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n \nEightieth Session \nFebruary 18, 2019 \n \n \nThe Senate Committee on Health and Human Services was called to order by \nChair Julia Ratti at 4:49 p.m. on Monday, February 18, 2019, in Room 2149 of \nthe  Legislative  Building,  Carson City,  Nevada.

One is from the Governor's Office to add \na  full-time  director  position  and  the  other  appears  to  have  come  from  the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. We need to be clear to which office \nyou believe the position should be designated. \n \nMR. SCHWARTZ: \nMs. Rique Robb will be able to answer your question. My understanding is, one \nis from the General Fund and the other from the Telecommunication Device for \nthe Deaf (TDD) surcharge. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 18, 2019 \nPage 3 \n \nRIQUE  ROBB  (Deputy  Administrator,  Aging  and  Disability  Services  Division, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nThe Aging and Disability Services Division (ADSD) fiscal note is specific to the \nTDD  surcharge  and  is  inclusive  of  the  director  position  as  we  oversee  the \nsurcharge  aspect.  I  cannot  speak  on  behalf  of  the  Governor's  Office.  The \ncurrent $25,000 coming out of the Governor's Office is from the General Fund. \nI am unsure if the personnel fees are inclusive of the director position or another \nposition.  For  FY  2018-2019,  we  currently  receive  $25,000  to  support  the \nNevada Commission for Persons Who Are Deaf, Hard of Hearing or Speech \nImpaired  activities.  They  have  requested  an  increase  of  $25,000  to  equal \n$50,000  for  each  year  of  the  new  biennium,  which  would  come  from  the \nGeneral Fund. The ADSD fiscal note is inclusive of just the director position.  \n \nSENATOR WOODHOUSE: \nWhen this bill is processed out of the Committee on Health and Human Services \nand re-referred to the Senate Committee on Finance, our Fiscal Analysis Division \nwill take a look at this to make sure we are not doubling up anywhere. \n \nJEFF BEARDSLEY: \nI am a member of the Nevada Commission for Persons Who Are Deaf, Hard of \nHearing  or  Speech  Impaired,  testifying  for  the  Commission  in  support  of \nS.B. 93. \n \nMIKE EIFERT (Nevada Commission for Persons Who Are Deaf, Hard of Hearing or \nSpeech Impaired): \nAs a member of the Nevada Commission for Persons Who Are Deaf, Hard of \nHearing  or  Speech  Impaired,  I  am  here  to  testify  in  a  neutral  position.  The \nCommission is not opposed to this bill. I have one correction to a statement \nmade earlier. The current TDD surcharge was stated to be 7 cents, and is \nactually  6  cents.  That  is  per  Nevada  Public  Utilities  Commission  Docket \nNo.18-01033; Docket No. 19-01024 is reviewing the calculation for this year's \nTDD surcharge.  \n \nWe have concerns with regard to the funding of the director position. Our idea \nwas  to  get  recognition  within  the  State  to  acquire  General  Fund  money  to \nsupport the needs of the community. We are not opposed to using the TDD \nsurcharge. The ADSD fiscal note is missing the $50,000 we need from the \nGeneral Fund. The ADSD may believe they are speaking to just their portion, \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 18, 2019 \nPage 4 \n \nwhich is the TDD portion. There needs to be some marriage between the two. \nWe do not want the deaf community to lose its foothold in the General Fund.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 93 and open the hearing on S.B. 115. \n \nSENATE BILL 115: Requires the State Plan for Medicaid to include coverage for \ndonor breast milk. (BDR 38-560) \n \nSENATOR SCOTT HAMMOND (Senatorial District No. 18): \nSenate Bill 115 requires Medicaid to cover donor breast milk for babies born \nweighing 1,500 grams or less, having certain serious conditions or infections, or \notherwise require nourishment from breast milk as prescribed or ordered by a \nphysician or advanced practice registered nurse.  \n \nOur  research  clearly  demonstrates  that  breast  milk  is  best  for  all  infants, \nespecially  for  those  born  prematurely  or  seriously  ill.  Breast  milk  helps  to \nprevent infection and ensure healthy brain development. A technical review of \navailable evidence conducted by the World Health Organization confirmed that \nbreast feeding is the optimal means of nourishing low birth weight infants. It \nfound the next best option to be human donor milk.  \n \nSimilarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) supports using donor milk \nto improve the health of small preterm babies when necessary. According to the \nAAP,  studies  show  that  infants  fed  human  milk  have  lower  rates  of  a \nlife-threatening intestinal disorder called necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) which \naffects  one  in  ten  premature  babies.  This  condition  results  in  death  for \n30 percent of the infants with the disorder. However, studies show the risk of \nNEC is reduced by nearly 80 percent for infants who are fed pasteurized donor \nmilk compared to those fed infant formula.  \n \nThe  problem  for  many  premature  infants  is  that  while  donor  milk  could \nsignificantly  improve  their  health,  it  is  not  covered  by  Medicaid.  Requiring \nNevada Medicaid to cover donor milk would make a significant difference as the \nprogram covers 56 percent of all births in the State. Donor breast milk is not \ninexpensive, but the healthy benefits it creates would likely save State funds by \nreducing  expensive  treatment  for  hospital  stays.  When  New  York  State \nconsidered  a  similar  measure  in  2017,  the  New  York  branch  of  the  AAP \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 18, 2019 \nPage 5 \n \nestimated that providing donor breast milk to the 3,500 eligible infants would \nsave the state $10.5 million in direct hospital costs.  \n \nNevada is by no means blazing a new trail with this bill, but we can be at the \nforefront of a change that other states have had in place to support some of \ntheir  tiniest,  most  vulnerable  and  costly  citizens.  Other  states  including \nCalifornia,  Kansas,  Missouri,  New  York,  Texas,  Utah  and  the  District  of \nColumbia currently have similar requirements for Medicaid coverage. California's \nrequirement has been on the books since 1998, Texas since 2008, and others \npassed in the last few years. I realize the Division of Health Care Financing and \nPolicy of the Department of Health and Human Services has placed a fiscal note \non the bill.  \n \nNowhere  in  its  calculations  do  I  see  consideration  of  the  reduction  in  cost \nbecause of improved infant health, shorter hospital stays or reduced need for \noutpatient services. I look forward to working with the Division to develop a \nbetter understanding of what these savings might be in Nevada. This measure is \nfamily and fiscally friendly and I urge your support.  \n \nREBECCA  PERRY  (Neonatologist,  Renown  Regional  Medical  Center,  St.  Mary's \nRegional Medical Center; Medical Director, International Milk Bank): \nI would like to affirm the importance of the AAP and other organizations who \nhave stressed how important donor breast milk is to an infant in the first six \nmonths. Infants born weighing less than 1,500 grams have a significant risk of \ncontracting NEC.  \n \nWhen  I  was  on  service  this  past  weekend  an  infant  died  from  NEC  where \nischemic  bowel  from  the  stomach  was  passed  through  the  colon.  As \nneonatologists we do our best to minimize this risk. In my practice, I see donor \nbreast milk improves tolerance and infants go to full feeds quicker, therefore \nthey need less days of total parenteral nutrition or intravenous nutrition. There is \npotentially  less  length  of  hospital  stay  needed  for  these  babies,  and  the \nlong-term benefits are too many to list.  \n \nI also affirm indications of this proposed bill on who would receive the donor \nbreast milk and the importance of the fortifier. Babies who are quite small need \nextra  milk  which  cannot  fully  provide  the  calories,  protein,  and  phosphorus \nbabies with critical nutrition issues need. There are concerns about the ethical \nuse of non-profit versus for-profit milk along with paying donors to provide milk. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 18, 2019 \nPage 6 \n \nWe need to have a thorough analysis completed showing the benefits of using \nnon-profit milk. The for-profit industry allows these technological advances to \nhappen which ultimately benefit these babies. On the other hand, we want to \nprovide the safest and highest quality milk. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThere is some confusion about calling it donor breast milk which implies there is \na donation, but there is a $25 million fiscal note attached to the bill, that is not \na donation. Is someone able to walk through the process of how the milk makes \nit from one place to the next? \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nMs. Medo in Las Vegas may be able to provide an explanation. There are two \nfriendly amendments (Exhibit E and Exhibit F) that have been proposed that may \nassist in explaining the position of the Nevada Academy of Physician Assistants \nand Tremont Strategies Group, and why they placed that fiscal note. \n \nELENA MEDO (CEO, Medolac Labs): \nI am here representing Medolac Labs in support of Senate Bill 115 and have \nsubmitted  written  testimony  (Exhibit G)  which  would  require  Medicaid  to \nreimburse for the use of donor milk, human milk fortifier.  \n \nI previously founded Prolacta Bioscience in 1999 and led the development for \nthe first human milk fortifier made from human milk. This fortifier is a protein \nconcentrate that is added to a mother's own milk to increase the protein to a \nlevel that is four times more than human milk to meet the needs of these very \nunderdeveloped, tiny babies for normal brain development, lean body mass and \nimmune  factors.  I  no  longer  have  a  financial  interest  in  Prolacta  but  am \nenthusiastic about the product I developed.  \n \nI left Prolacta in 2009 with the goal of creating a new generation of donor milk \nthat would allow high volume scale to decrease the cost while improving the \nquality  and  ease  of  use.  We  did  receive  an  incentive  package  from  the \nGovernor's Office of Economic Development and relocated our company last \nyear from Portland, Oregon to Boulder City, Nevada, bringing us closer to the \nfulfillment of our goal. We purchased a 47,000 square foot building and began \ndevelopment of one of the largest scale human milk processing facilities in the \nworld. We have increased our production capacity from 1,000 gallons a month \nto several thousand gallons per week. We will have enough capacity when we \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 18, 2019 \nPage 7 \n \ncomplete the plan in May to provide human milk to every preterm baby in the \ncountry at a fraction of the current cost.  \n \nYou may wonder how many babies in Nevada would be affected by this. Out of \nthe  38,000-40,000  births  per  year  in  Nevada,  about  10  percent  are  born \nweighing less than 1,500 grams, or less than 3.5 pounds. About 472 of those \nbabies will get NEC which is gangrene of the gut. It is a terrible disease, creates \na lot of suffering, and has a high mortality rate and a very high economic cost.  \n \nI would second Senator Hammond's suggestion that when looking at the fiscal \nimpact of this, the realistic view be collected on what it is currently costing the \nState to take care of these 472 babies, among which 157 will die of NEC. \nStudies have shown that at least half of those babies can be saved if they are \ngiven only human milk. Babies who live through life saving surgery to remove \ngangrenous intestinal tissue to save their lives will lose up to 80 percent of their \ngut, and thereafter have a difficult time.  \n \nThe AAP recently published an economic impact report that put the average \namount of one death through NEC at $12.5 million. Babies surviving surgery \nend up at home struggling to take solid food, grow and have incredibly high \nmedical costs. Many die at the age of 8 or 9 years old after having end of life \ncosts. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released Evidence \nReport/Technology  Assessment  Number  153,  intended  to  help  clinicians, \nemployees and policymakers make decisions regarding provisions of health care \nservices. In part two of the study they examined the relationship between NEC \nand  breast  milk  feeding  and  I  quote,  \"There  is  evidence  to  support  an \nassociation between breast milk feeding and a reduction of the risk of NEC.\" \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDoes this milk require pasteurization? \n \nMS. MEDO: \nAbsolutely.  Donors  apply,  fill  out  a  screening  form,  and  if  pre-qualified  are \ndirected to go to any of the 1,500 LabCorp locations nationwide to have a \nblood test completed. Blood tests are completed for human immunodeficiency \nvirus (HIV), human T-lymphotropic virus, human papillomavirus, hepatitis C and \nsyphilis. The mothers donating are retested in our program every six months to \nascertain they remain non-infective.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 18, 2019 \nPage 8 \n \nWhen the milk arrives, we ship a validated cooler to the donor. When the cooler \nis returned to our plant in Boulder City, we have a full microbiology and food \nsafety lab where testing on the milk begins. We test for drugs, alcohol, bacteria, \nviruses and adulteration with diluting milk, or any other type of milk, or dilution \nwith water. Only after that testing is done are the donations of the mother's \nmilk,  which  average  about  four  gallons  each,  processed  and  heat  treated \ncreating a shelf-stable product in a flexible pouch that is good for up to three \nyears at room temperature. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWhat is the process for locating donors? \n \nMS. MEDO: \nMost donors use social media and tend to visit our website, or the Mothers Milk \nCooperative website. \n \nKATIE RYAN (Dignity Health-St. Rose Dominican): \nWe are in support of S.B. 115.  \n \nDEEPA  NAGAR  M.D.  (Neonatal  Intensive  Care  Unit  Medical  Director, \nDignity Health-St. Rose Dominican): \nI  am  here  on  behalf  of  Dignity  Health-St.  Rose  Dominican  in  support  of \nSenate Bill 115 and will read from my written testimony (Exhibit H).  \n \nThe fiscal note has placed this bill at $8.8 million for a 2-year period. However, \na 2012 national health interview survey study on the use of human donor milk \nshows a state would save over $32 million per year in hospital lengths of stay \nalone. For every dollar we spend on human donor milk, a Neo-Natal Intensive \nCare Unit (NICU) cost savings is between $11 and $37 in hospital lengths of \nstay. Preventing approximately 15 cases of surgical NEC would justify the cost \nof the fiscal note alone, which equates to less than ten cases a year we would \nneed to prevent. \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nThere is a proposed amendment, Exhibit E, provided by Mr. Hackett and one \nfrom Liesl Sheehan, Exhibit F, proposed amendment which adds language to the \nbill. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 18, 2019 \nPage 9 \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nMedolac Laboratories is a producer of donor breast milk. Several physicians \nseem to have an affiliation with Mednax. Can someone explain what Mednax is? \n \nDR. NAGAR: \nMednax is a multi-specialty group which has a presence in each state of the \ncountry. For neonatology, we are present in 32 states. We cover neonatology \nas one of our most focused areas of clinical care. Currently our NICU coverage \nin  Nevada  includes  every  single  hospital  system  and  hospital  including  Las \nVegas and Reno. The only hospital we do not cover is University Medical Center \n(UMC).  \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nIs there any relationship between Mednax and Medolac? \n \nDR. NAGAR: \nNo, there is not. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nIs there a reason UMC is not covered? \n \nMS. NAGAR: \nAs I understand, UMC has not asked us for coverage. \n \nMS. RYAN: \nOur  physicians  are  not  employed,  so  we  employ  Mednax  to  cover  our \nneonatology NICU services, I am unsure as to what UMC does. \n \nDr. NAGAR: \nI would like to emphasize every hospital system has a different medical director. \nWe are an independent group that focuses on providing coverage for donor \nbreast milk as a priority. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIt appears as if some NICU babies are receiving donor breast milk now. Are \nMedicaid babies getting donor breast milk, and if so, how is it being paid for? \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nI will defer to the folks in Las Vegas to answer that question. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 18, 2019 \nPage 10 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nHow close are we to meeting the need now? Are very young people who are on \nMedicaid now receiving this benefit or are they being excluded because they \ncannot afford it? \n \nDR. NAGAR: \nI am privileged to have worked with Dignity Health for the last several years and \nwe have had this program since 2012. Every single patient that meets criteria to \nget donor breast milk, and/or Prolacta which is the fortifier, receives the donor \nmilk at no cost to the patient. Our hospital system pays for it because we feel it \nis that important and we spend the money as we know it reduces overall cost. \nNot all hospital systems in our State are currently able to afford this cost. Each \nsystem has different criteria for which some patients are not eligible nor do they \nhave this program in the NICUs. This is why our State has a higher rate of NEC \nthan some of the other states. \n \nMS. MEDO: \nWhen human donor milk is provided it is quite often only provided for a short \nperiod  of  time.  St.  Rose  Dominican  Hospital  provides  donor  milk  for  babies \nunder 1,250 grams at birth and only until they reach 1,500 grams. At most \nother hospitals, such as UMC, they are not providing human donor milk at all. \nThey do have a disproportionate share of population there that is less likely to \nbreast  feed  than  at  other  hospitals  serving  different  populations.  Up  to \n80 percent of the children meeting the weight category of under 1,500 grams \nare not currently getting donor milk in Nevada. As Dr. Nagar stated, that would \nexplain the high infant mortality and NEC rates among this infant population.  \n \nGEORGE ROSS (Sunrise Hospital): \nSunrise Hospital in Las Vegas is in favor of Senate Bill 115. They use significant \nquantities of mother's milk and it definitely leads to better outcomes. Whether a \nchild is on Medicaid or not is irrelevant to whether they receive this service. \nOnce a child is in the NICU they get the best care we can provide whether they \ncan afford 1 penny or 100 percent of the total cost.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nToday, is every Medicaid baby in the hospital you represent meeting the criteria \nand getting this product? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 18, 2019 \nPage 11 \n \nMR. ROSS: \nI cannot say exactly. I do know whether a person is on Medicaid or not, it is \nirrelevant as to whether they receive donor milk. Their financial situation does \nnot matter. We do have a significant program and use significant amounts of \nthe product which is part of the program to care for NICU babies. We have the \nhighest seriousness of NICU babies in the State. \n \nMICHAEL HACKETT (Nevada Academy of Physician Assistants): \nWe want to include physician assistants among the two provider types that are \nidentified in the proposed amendment, Exhibit E, of those who can, and do, \nissue these types of orders. The reason for this is to ensure there is coverage \nfor those families when this order is issued by a physician assistant. That is the \nnature of the amendment, and we are in support of the bill. \n \nLIESL SHEEHAN (Prolacta Bioscience Inc.): \nI am here representing Prolacta Bioscience in support of Senate Bill 115 and the \nproposed amendment, Exhibit F. Doctors and experts all agree that mother's \nbreast milk is the best source of nutrition for babies. The AAP recommends that \nbreast milk be the sole source for all newborns up to age six months. Not all \nmothers can provide breast milk due to an inability to produce breast milk, \nadoption, surrogacy or other complications.  \n \nFor very low birth weight babies, 1,500 grams and less, the need for breast milk \nis the highest. During the last trimester unborn babies receive vast amounts of \nnutrition through the umbilical cord. Very premature babies miss this crucial \nnutrition and their dietary needs are greater than what breast milk alone can \nsupply. Without human milk based, human milk fortifier, not cow's milk based \nhuman  milk  fortifier,  very  low  birthweight  babies  are  at  increased  risk  for \ndeveloping  NEC.  They  may  encounter  slower  neurological  development  and \nother  complications  that  can  significantly  and  permanently  impact  a  baby's \nquality of life if the baby survives.  \n \nThis is where Prolacta enters the picture. Prolacta produces the human milk \nbased, human milk fortifier mixed with the mothers own pumped milk, or other \ndonor milk providing babies with the 100 percent human milk diet. The fortifier \nis necessary only until the very low birthweight babies reach what would be a \nfull  term  gestational  period  and  is  key  to  avoiding  the  issues  previously \nmentioned. The fortifier is being used by several NICUs in the State today.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 18, 2019 \nPage 12 \n \nIn addition to these life-saving impacts of the 100 percent human milk diet, the \nuse of the human milk fortifier is cost effective. Studies show the 100 percent \nhuman milk diet averages a 4.5 day reduction in NICU stay and 9 days less of \ntotal parenteral nutrition (TPN) feeding. The savings and the reduction of NICU \nstays and TPN feeding alone equates to over double the cost of the donor \nhuman milk and human milk based fortifier diet, making the course of treatment \nnot only life-saving but cost effective. That is not to mention the cost of the \navoidance of surgical intervention should a baby develop NEC.  \n \nThe cost of just the surgery, where a premature baby's intestines are partially \nremoved,  often  costs  upward  of  $200,000.  In  comparison,  the  cost  of  the \n100 percent human milk diet, which reduces the risk of NEC by 77 percent, is \nless than 5 percent of the cost of the surgical intervention.  \n \nIn addition, Prolacta is a for-profit and does remunerate mothers, or a charity of \nher choice, one dollar per ounce. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIs it a secret what is in the fortifier? Is there a label with the contents? \n \nMS. SHEEHAN: \nWe have specific labels that identify calories and what is included for protein. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIs human milk fortifier meant to be used alone until after the baby reaches \n1,500 grams? \n \nMS. SHEEHAN: \nThe  fortifier  is  only  used  between  22  and  36  weeks  gestational  period \ndepending on the baby and the actual case. Once the baby reaches the full term \ngestational period it is up to the physician or physician assistant. The fortifier is \nnot used alone, it is mixed with the mother's own milk or donor milk. \n \nELISA CAFFERATA (Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada): \nI am here on behalf of Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada. We have spent the \nlast several sessions supporting the State to step up to address health care \nneeds for healthy mothers and babies. We support this bill. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 18, 2019 \nPage 13 \n \nJARED BUSKER (Children's Advocacy Alliance): \nChildren's Advocacy Alliance is in support of Senate Bill 115. \n \nSUZANNE BIERMAN (Administrator, Division of Health Care Financing and Policy, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nThe Division of Health Care Financing and Policy (DHCFP) is neutral on this bill. \nWe recognize the benefits of breast feeding recommended as a best practice. \nWe  also  recognize  that  breast  milk  can  have  even  more  significant  health \nbenefits for very low birthweight infants in particular.  \n \nHowever, we wanted to bring up questions with this bill and what it might \nmean for the DHCFP. Because this product is not regulated at the federal level, \na regulatory framework would need to be established to ensure the product is \nsafe and appropriate quality guidelines are established and followed. The DHCFP \nwould need to make sure the product is tested and screened for various viruses \nsuch as HIV and hepatitis and there are safeguards to prevent the possibility of \ndisease transmission.  \n \nThere  will  be  a  fiscal  impact  related  to  this  bill  and  the  DHCFP  is  doing \nadditional work on the fiscal impact. We still have a number of open questions \nand look forward to working with the sponsor and the Committee on Health and \nHuman Services to clear up those issues. There will be costs associated with \nthis as it will be a new service and product, and there are costs associated with \nregulation of this product. We welcome the opportunity to work through our \nopen issues related to information we need for our revised fiscal impact. The \ncurrent estimate is likely overstated, and will depend on foundational questions \nwe have around the scope of the services.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSenator Hammond I would appreciate your help looking into how many of our \nhospitals with a NICU that have a donor milk program, have babies within those \nhospitals getting the donor milk and how are they now being funded.  \n \n   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 18, 2019 \nPage 14 \n \nAs there is no further business, we will adjourn this meeting at 5:52 p.m. \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nVickie Polzien, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 18, 2019 \nPage 15 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nExhibit / \nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \n# of pages \n  A  1    Agenda \n  B  6    Attendance Roster \nS.B. 93  C  2  Senator Spearman  Written Testimony \nEli Schwartz, Nevada \nCommission for Persons \nS.B. 93  D  2  Written Testimony \nWho Are Deaf, Hard of \nHearing or Speech Impaired \nMichael Hackett, Nevada \nS.B. 115  E  1  Academy of Physician  Proposed Amendment \nAssistants \nLiesel Sheehan, Prolacta \nS.B. 115  F  1  Proposed Amendment \nBioscience Inc. \nS.B. 115  G  3  Elena Medo, Medolac Labs  Testimony In Support \nDeepa Nagar Dignity Health-\nS.B. 115  H  2  Testimony in Support \nSt. Rose Dominican \n ", "13": "\nMINUTES OF THE  \nSENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n \nEightieth Session \nFebruary 20, 2019 \n \n \nThe Senate Committee on Health and Human Services was called to order by \nChair Julia Ratti at 4:05 p.m. on Wednesday, February 20, 2019, in Room 2149 \nof  the  Legislative  Building,  Carson City,  Nevada.

(BDR 40-488) \n \nALEX ORTIZ (Clark County): \nI am here today with Mason Van Houweling, who will present S.B. 77 on behalf \nof Clark County.  \n \nMASON VAN HOUWELING (CEO, University Medical Center, Clark County): \nMy name is Mason Van Houweling, and I am the CEO of the University Medical \nCenter  (UMC)  located  in  Las  Vegas.  I  am  here  to  present  my  testimony \n(Exhibit C) on S.B. 77. At this time I will answer any questions the Committee \nmay have. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThis sounds like a great idea, and we all want to see more savings for UMC. We \nknow your budget is funded by the taxpayers. I just want to make sure there \nare not any unintended consequences. Does this in any way make it difficult to \ncompete for services for local companies, small business and vendors? How \nwould this affect the opportunities for small business, since you are a significant \nplayer in your community?  \n \nMR. VAN HOUWELING: \nNevada Revised Statutes 332 and 338, which apply to prevailing wages, would \ncontinue also, all local cover contracts would still be applied. We want to make \nsure  we  are  supporting  local  businesses.  I  do  not  see  this  affecting  local \nbusiness. If they chose, they can be part of the group purchasing organization \n(GPO). There is a process for them to apply. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 20, 2019 \nPage 3 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI  want  to  make  absolutely  sure  any  potentially  displaced  vendors  get  that \ninformation so they know they can be part of the GPO.  \n \nMR. VAN HOUWELING: \nYes they will.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs there anyone here who would like to testify in support of S.B. 77?  \n \nJOAN HALL (President, Nevada Rural Hospital Partners): \nI am representing Nevada Rural Hospital Partners, seven of our members are \ncounty or district hospitals that would be affected by this. Those hospitals are \nin  Battle  Mountain,  Lovelock,  Winnemucca,  Ely,  Caliente,  Hawthorne,  and \nYerington.  We  belong  to  the  GPO.  We  would  benefit  from  language \ninterpretation services, equipment maintenance services, document destruction, \ncoding services, pest control and peer review services. We could benefit by \nusing the reduced cost of the GPO services.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe  are  going  to  close  the  hearing  for  S.B.  77  and  open  the  hearing  for \nSenate Bill (S.B.) 92. I will have Vice Chair Spearman, conduct the meeting, \nwhile I present this bill.  \n \nSENATE  BILL  92:  Revises  provisions  concerning  certain  group  housing. \n(BDR 40-526) \n \nSENATOR JULIA RATTI (Senatorial District No. 13): \nI had the privilege of serving on the Interim Health Committee. During that time, \nthe Interim Health Committee received the results of an audit that looked at \nsome of the challenges we faced serving the seriously mentally ill population \nthrough congregate living situations. During this Legislative Session you will see \nmultiple bills that will address some of the findings of the audit. The problem \nS.B.  92  tackles  is  unlicensed  referral  agencies,  who  are  typically  receiving \npatients as they are discharged from the hospital. They are then referring that \npatient to a congregate living situation that may or may not be a licensed home. \nThe hospital may feel they have a qualified discharge and their patient is going \nto a safe and appropriate setting; however, these individuals or entities are not \nlicensed and we have no way of making sure that is happening. In fact, there \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 20, 2019 \nPage 4 \n \nare instances where we know that folks are getting referred to settings that are \nnot appropriate. This bill seeks to remedy this situation by licensing the referral \nagencies and making sure they are providing referrals to appropriate settings.  \n \nThis bill also gives some direction to the Department of Health and Human \nServices  (DHHS)  to  dig  a  little  bit  deeper  and  try  to  unearth  unlicensed \ncongregate group settings. There may be instances where folks are living in a \ngroup home setting in which it looks like a group home, acts like a group home \nbut has never gotten a license. We are asking DHHS to provide an aggressive \napproach to find and unearth some of these unlicensed congregate settings. If \nthe setting should be licensed, the DHHS will make sure it gets a license. This \nway, we can provide due diligence to ensure it is appropriate for the clients it \nserves.  \n \nJULIE KOTCHEVAR (Deputy Administrator, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services):  \nThe first section of S.B. 92 broadens the definition of what is a referral agency. \nCurrently, you have to be licensed as a referral agency only if you refer to one \ntype of licensed home—a residential facility for groups. So, if you refer to any \nother type of home, you are not required to be a licensed referral agency. This \nwas a gap that allowed identified referral agencies to make referrals to either \nunlicensed homes or licensed homes, but there was no oversight of the people \nmaking those referrals. This would broaden the definition to include anyone \nmaking a referral to a housing arrangement who provides support for anyone \nwho  is  a  vulnerable  person  including:  people  who  have  a  mental  illness, \nintellectual disability, developmental disability, physical disability, the aged or \ninfirm. This covers people we consider vulnerable populations who would be \nserved in these settings.  \n \nThe second section of the bill requires the Division of Public and Behavioral \nHealth (DPBH) to conduct a review of unlicensed homes to look at how to \nidentify them and whether we can establish regulations to identify which ones \nshould be licensed. We are trying to balance the rights of people to rent a room \nor  to  live  with  roommates  without  over-regulating  people's  housing \narrangements. At the same time, we are honing in on housing arrangements \nthat provide support to people such as food, shelter, some sort of assistance or \nbehavioral support. Where is the line separating when you need to be licensed \nversus not needing a license? We will look at strategies to identify them in more \nautomated ways, such as looking for business license terms like independent \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 20, 2019 \nPage 5 \n \nliving home. For example, the term independent living home might appear on a \nbusiness license of a home that is not licensed with us. If they are calling \nthemselves  an  independent  living  home,  are  they  licensed?  If  they  are  not \nlicensed,  maybe  we  would  check  whether  they  should  or  should  not  be \nlicensed.  \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN:  \nSeeing there are no questions from the Committee, is there anyone here in \nsupport of S.B. 92? \n \nHELEN FOLEY (Nevada Assisted Living Association): \nI  am  here  today,  representing  the  Nevada  Assisted  Living  Association.  We \nsupport this legislation. We saw during the audits many nefarious things going \non.  There  were  people  living  in  squalor  and  several  types  of  housing \narrangements. We know this bill is a good first start. There will be several other \nbills this Session. We support making sure the referrals are regulated.  \n \nDEVIN BROOKS (Brooks Behavioral Health Center): \nI  am  the  owner  of  Brooks  Behavioral  Health  Center.  I  want  to  state  that \nunlicensed homes have been an issue in our community. I would like to add, we \nhave some unlicensed transitional homes that are terrible and some are amazing. \nWe would like to see some language to assist the transition for those unlicensed \ntransitional homes that are a benefit to the State. I support S.B. 92.  \n \nSARAH ADLER (President, National Alliance on Mental Illness): \nI am the President for the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), Western \nNevada Affiliate and a Nevada lobbyist for NAMI. I am joined by many members \nof NAMI. I would like to present testimony (Exhibit D) in support of S.B. 92. \nToo often our justice system seems like our public health system. We do not \nseek to amend the bill, we see it as a good start. \n \nMS. HALL: \nWe support this bill as it helps those vulnerable residents who need a lot of \nhelp.  \n \nBarry Gold (AARP): \nMy name is Barry Gold and I am here to represent AARP. The decision to leave \nyour own home and live in some type of residential facility or the decision to \nplace your loved one in some type of residential facility, is probably the hardest \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 20, 2019 \nPage 6 \n \nand biggest decision a family or person will ever make. Having a referral agent \nwho has knowledge about this process helps people make those decisions. We \nneed to make sure these referral agents know what they are doing and, just as \nimportant, there is someone looking at the referral agents to make sure they \nknow what they are doing. These referral agents need to be licensed to give \ntransparency and oversight to the people who are looking to leave their own \nhome or place their loved ones in a home. On behalf of the 348,000 AARP \nmembers across the State, we urge you to support S.B. 92. \n \nTRACY BROWN-MAY (Opportunity Village): \nWe are in support of S.B. 92. We belief in oversight to protect the vulnerable \npopulations  many  of  us  serve.  Typically,  people  who  have  intellectual  and \ndevelopmental  disabilities  are  not  together  in  one  bill;  however,  seeing  the \nresults of the audit we are here to offer our support.  \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMEN: \nWe will close the hearing on S.B. 92 and I will return control of the meeting to \nChair Ratti. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe will open the hearing on Senate Bill (S.B.) 95.  \n \nSENATE  BILL  95:  Revises  provisions  governing  diets  that  are  ordered  or \nprescribed for patients. (BDR 40-445) \n \nSENATOR PATRICIA SPEARMAN (Senatorial District 1):  \nI am here to present S.B. 95 on behalf of the Legislative Committee on Health \nCare,  which  I  chaired  during  the  2017-2018  Interim.  This  bill  takes  a  step \ntoward  improving  patient's  outcomes,  reducing  the  cost  of  health  care  and \nshortening the length of hospital stays. It was proposed at the request of a \nrepresentative of the Nevada Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. It enables \nlicensed  dieticians  to  independently  order  special  diets  and  ensure  medical \nfacilities must provide diets as ordered or prescribed.  \n \nSpecifically, S.B. 95 requires medical facilities to take any actions necessary to \nadhere  to  a  diet  ordered  or  prescribed  by  a  licensed  dietician,  physician, \nphysician  assistant,  dentist,  advanced  practice  registered  nurse  or  podiatric \nphysician.  Such  facilities  must  maintain  documentation  demonstrating \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 20, 2019 \nPage 7 \n \ncompliance with these requirements and provide it to the DPBH of the DHHS \nupon request.  \n \nThis is a timely bill. One of my constituents was prescribed a renal diet and the \nfacility they were in did not provide it. Upon further examination, the facility did \nnot even have the food. Had it not been for the dietician, this person could have \ngone  without  the  proper  nutrition.  This  bill  will  help  improve  the  health  of \nNevadans.  \n \nMICHAEL HACKETT (Nevada Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics): \nI am here on behalf of the Nevada Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (NvAND). \nAnother purpose of this legislation is to have State law conform to the Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Ruling issued in 2014 addressing this \nparticular issue. We have individuals in Las Vegas who can answer questions \nfrom the perspective of the NvAND. They can answer clinical questions as well \nas the cost benefit we feel is going to be achieved by hospitals if this legislation \nis passed.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nLet us take the prepared testimony from Las Vegas and then open the meeting \nup for questions.  \n \nALLISON SCHNITZER (Nevada Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics): \nI am a registered and licensed dietitian here in Las Vegas. I am also the State \nPolicy Representative for the NvAND. I am here to read testimony (Exhibit E) in \nsupport for S.B. 95.  \n \nMADELINE BELAUSTEGUI (Nevada Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics) \nMy name is Madeline Belaustegui and I have been a registered dietitian working \nin  a  clinical  setting  in  Las  Vegas  for  almost  four  years.  I  am  here  to  read \ntestimony (Exhibit F) in support of S.B. 95. \n \nKRISTINA LABOUFF (Nevada Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics): \nMy name is Kristina LaBouff. I am a registered and licensed dietitian who has \nbeen working in the clinical field in Las Vegas for five years. I am also the \nsecretary of the NvAND. I am here to testify (Exhibit G) in support of S.B. 95.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 20, 2019 \nPage 8 \n \nNIKKI BAILEY-LUNDAHL (Nevada Nurses Association): \nMy name is Nikki Bailey-Lundahl and I am here to represent the Nevada Nurses \nAssociation. The nurses are in support of S.B. 95. We believe it streamlines the \nprocess and allows the provider to give better patient care.  \n \nMS. HALL: \nMy name is Joan Hall and I am here today representing Nevada Rural Hospital \nPartners.  We  are  in  support  of  S.B.  95.  We  just  wish  there  were  more \ndieticians.  \n \nCATHERINE O'MARA (Nevada State Medical Association): \nMy name if Catherine O'Mara and I am here today representing the Nevada \nState  Medical  Association.  We  are  in  support  of  S.B.  95.  The  physician \ncommunity believes registered and licensed dieticians are an important partner. \nWe support improved evidenced based nutrition care for our patients.  \n \nAURORA BUFFINGTON (Southern Nevada Food Council): \nMy name is Aurora Buffington and I am the convener for the Southern Nevada \nFood Council, as well as a registered and licensed dietitian. I am here to testify \nin support of S.B. 95 (Exhibit H). I have also provided the public with a letter of \nsupport (Exhibit I). \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe are going to close the hearing for S.B. 95.  \n \nWe have three bills with all support and no opposition. I will accept a motion to \nDo Pass for S.B. 77.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY MOVED TO DO PASS S.B. 77. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANAMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \n \n \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 20, 2019 \nPage 9 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will accept a motion to Do Pass S.B. 92. \n \nSENATOR WOODHOUSE MOVED TO DO PASS S.B. 92. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANAMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will accept a motion to Do Pass S.B. 95. \n \nSENATOR HARDY MOVED TO DO PASS S.B. 95. \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANAMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe will now open the meeting for public comment. \n \nKATHY BAKST: \nMy name is Kathy Bakst and I am a family member of NAMI Western Nevada \nAffiliate. I have an adult son who is severely mentally ill. He has lived in seven \nof those group homes that were closed down. I was in them pretty much daily \nfor the past two or three years. Currently, I keep him in an apartment with a \ncaregiver  because  the  group  homes  were  inadequate.  Not  only  were  they \ninadequate because they were underfunded and not a healthy place, there was \nno rehab or any type of help for my son. There were no daily meetings, there \nwere no activities, there was nothing going on. We definitely need to pass \nS.B. 92, because there needs to be more oversight. There were social workers \nthat did not pay attention to what was going on in the homes. It was a bad \nsituation I would not send my worst enemy to one of those homes. I could give \nyou 50 stories of bad things that happened. I hope you pass this bill.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 20, 2019 \nPage 10 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI want to remind everyone S.B. 92 is just one of several bills covering this topic. \nI appreciate your engagement and helping us to make good decisions.  \n \nThis meeting is adjourned at 4:53 p.m. \n \n \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nMichelle Hamilton, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 20, 2019 \nPage 11 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nExhibit / \nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \n# of pages \n  A  1    Agenda \n  B  5    Attendance Roster \nMason VanHouwelling / \nS.B. 77  C  2  Written Testimony \nUniversity Medical Center \nSarah Adler / National \nS.B. 92  D  2  Written Testimony \nAlliance on Mental Illness \nAllison Schnitzer / Nevada \nS.B. 95  E  1  Academy of Nutrition and  Written Testimony \nDietetics \nMadeline Belaustegui / \nS.B. 95  F  1  Nevada Academy of  Written Testimony \nNutrition and Dietetics \nKristina LaBouff / Nevada \nS.B. 95  G  2  Academy of Nutrition and  Written Testimony \nDietetics \nAurora Buffington / \nS.B. 95  H  1  Southern Nevada Food  Written Testimony \nCouncil \nAurora Buffington / \nS.B. 95  I  2   Southern Nevada Food  Handout Support Letter \nCouncil  \n ", "14": "\nMINUTES OF THE  \nSENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n \nEightieth Session \nFebruary 25, 2019 \n \n \nThe Senate Committee on Health and Human Services was called to order by \nChair Julia Ratti at 3:01 p.m. on Monday, February 25, 2019, in Room 2149 of \nthe  Legislative  Building,  Carson City,  Nevada.

(BDR 40-292) \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 3 \n \nSENATOR DAVID R. PARKS (Senatorial District No. 7): \nI will read the preamble to S.B. 165 found on pages 3 and 4 of the bill. \n \nWHEREAS,  A  patient  should  have  the  right  to  self-determination \nconcerning  his  or  her  health  care  decisions  based  on \ncommunications with his or her physician; and \n \nWHEREAS, Principles of law having their roots in common law and \nthe  United  States  Constitution  that  date  back  to  the  late  19th \ncentury establish the right of every person to the possession and \ncontrol of his or her own body, free from restraint or interference \nby others; and \n \nWHEREAS, It is necessary to promote awareness and discussion of \nhealth care issues in preparation for decisions concerning the end \nof the life of a person; and \n \nWHEREAS,  A  person  should  have  the  right  to  self-determination \nconcerning medically assisted, informed, voluntary decisions about \ndying with dignity and avoiding unnecessary suffering; and \n \nWHEREAS, A person who suffers from a terminal condition should \nhave the right to determine whether to fight for his or her life using \nall reasonable care until life's end, to enroll in hospice care, to seek \npalliative care, to ingest a drug to end his or her life or to take any \ncombination of those actions. \n \nSenate Bill 165 is our third, and hopefully, last and successful attempt to enact \nthis  legislation.  I  have  been  asked  by  people  from  across  Nevada  in  many \ndifferent legislative districts to pass this legislation. Some are cancer patients \nwho want to have the peace of mind knowing they can control their final days. \nOthers are Nevadans who are healthy now, but want to know that if they are \ndiagnosed with a terminal illness, and after exploring all traditional options, a \nlegal, safe and peaceful option is available to them to control the end of their \nlife on their own terms.  \n \nThere are some who will quote one of the several versions of the Hippocratic \nOath in opposition to this measure. There are other portions of this Oath they \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 4 \n \nseem to have forgotten. For those who actually abide by the Oath, and many \ndoctors no longer take it, I remind them of this portion of the Oath. \n \nI  will  apply  for  the  benefit  of  the  sick,  all  measures  [that]  are \nrequired,  avoiding  those  twin  traps  of  overtreatment  and \ntherapeutic nihilism. I will remember that there is no art to medicine \nas well as science, and that warmth, sympathy, and understanding \nmay outweigh the surgeon's knife or the chemist's drug.  \n \nWhat this means is they take an oath to realize they must consider the patient \nand what is best for them.  \n \nWhen the patient says, \"enough is enough, I am done,\" a good physician who \nswears by the Hippocratic Oath should respect that. We are fortunate in this \nCountry to have many good physicians and I consider my colleague, Dr. Hardy, \nto be in that company.  \n \nI invite other supporters to present their testimony to the Committee. I would \nlike Dr. Peg Sandeen of the National Death with Dignity organization to walk \nyou through S.B. 165 and answer any questions you may have concerning the \nlanguage and the process as it stands. \n \nDR. PEG SANDEEN (Executive Director, Death with Dignity): \nI am going to review each section of S.B. 165 and attempt to be as brief as \npossible, highlighting the important sections. \n \nSection  1  deals  with  details  of  the  medical  certificate  of  death  listing  the \nunderlying cause of death as the disease.  \n \nSections  3  through  10  provide  important  definitions  I  will  refer  to  as  I  go \nthrough each section. \n \nSection 11 is a legislative justification for end of life options. \n \nSection 12 is an important section as it identifies what must happen for a \npatient to be eligible and qualify for assistance in dying. There are six points \nabout qualification. They must be an adult 18 years of age or older and a State \nresident. They must be diagnosed with a terminal disease by two physicians; \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 5 \n \nthe  attending  physician  and  one  consulting  physician.  The  definition  from \nsection 10 states a person has a 6 month prognosis.  \n \nThe  patient  must  have  an  informed  voluntary  decision,  informed  consent \nessential to the process. The patient must be mentally competent, meaning they \nhave the ability to make and understand the nature of the decision. The concept \nof competence is set forth in this statute in section 5. No coercion or undue \ninfluence can be present for a patient to qualify for a prescription to hasten \ndeath. \n \nThere are safeguards that are related to the requests; the waiting periods and \nthe witnesses that are set forth in section 13 of S.B. 165. The patient must \nmake 2 verbal requests to the attending physician and there is a waiting period \nof 15 days. The second verbal request needs to be made at least 15 days after \nthe  first  request.  A  written  request  must  also  be  made  to  the  attending \nphysician. The written request must be signed by two witnesses. One of the \nwitnesses cannot be a person related to the patient, nor standing to benefit \nfrom their death in a will.  \n \nSection 14 codifies the form of the written request; all states have a codified \nform of the written request. Nevada is in line with all states that have this type \nof legislation. \n \nSection  15  is  the  medical  standard  of  care.  It  sets  forth,  in  the  terms  of \nresponsibilities of the physician, all steps a physician must follow if a patient \nrequests a hastened death. The physician must inform the patient they may \nrevoke the request at any time during the process. The physician must verify \nthe patient understands both the diagnosis and the prognosis, and verify the \npatient understands the entire process he or she must undergo to qualify. The \nphysician must review all available means of treating or managing the patient's \nterminal condition; comfort care, hospice and pain control. The physician must \ndescribe the probable effects of the prescribed substance. The physician must \nmeet alone with the patient, or if an interpreter is necessary, they may attend to \ndetermine there is no evidence of coercion and the patient is acting voluntarily. \nThe physician must discuss the importance of having another person present \nwhen the patient self-administers or ingests the medication. The physician must \nrefer the patient for a second opinion with a consulting physician to confirm the \ndiagnosis and the prognosis. The physician must instruct the patient against \nadministering the prescription in a public place. The physician must recommend \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 6 \n \nthe patient notify the next of kin about their decision and reconfirm the patient \nis competent and acting without coercion before writing the prescription. \n \nSection 16 deals with mental competence, the patient's ability to make and \ncommunicate health care decisions. In this section it spells out if either the \nphysician,  the  attending  physician  or  the  consulting  physician  have  any \nconcerns the patient may not be competent. The attending physician shall refer \nthe patient for a consultation by a psychiatrist or psychologist and must not \nwrite  the  prescription  until  after  the  competency  status  is  determined.  The \nprocess must stop until a psychologist or psychiatrist determines the patient is \ncompetent to make health care decisions.  \n \nSection 17 regards the process of writing and dispensing the prescription. This \nsection allows the physician to write a prescription for the medication to hasten \ndeath if the safeguards in sections 12 through  14 are  met, as well as the \nstandard  of  care  set  out  in  sections  15  and  16  have  been  followed.  The \nphysician must notify the pharmacist of the prescription and transmit it directly \nto the pharmacist either electronically or in person. The drug may be dispensed \ndirectly only to the patient, the prescribing physician or an agent of the patient \nidentified to the pharmacist as such. This medication cannot be dispensed by \nmail. \n \nSection 18 provides a physician shall not prescribe the controlled substance \ndesigned to end the life of a patient based solely on age or disability of the \npatient.  \n \nSection 19 refers to medical record and charting requirements and spells out the \nattending physician and consulting physician. If the mental health consultation \noccurred, all three must document in the patient record all steps described in \nthe sections above. If the patient requests a change of physician, the attending \nphysician must transmit or forward the medical records of the patient to the \nnew physician on the request of the patient. \n \nSection 20 clarifies the patient's right to revoke their decision at any time and \nrevocation is effective immediately.  \n \nSection  21  spells  out  only  the  patient  who  receives  the  prescription  may \nself-administer the drug. If the substance is not self-administered, it must be \ndisposed of in accordance with Nevada law.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 7 \n \nSection 22 refers to reporting requirements for the physician and pharmacist. \nThe attending physician who prescribes the drug must report to the Health and \nHuman Services Division of Public and Behavioral Health the name and amount \nof  the  substance  prescribed.  The  pharmacist  must  also  report  the  same \ninformation. After the death of the patient, within 30 days, the physician must \nreport  to  the  same  Division  non-personal  identification  demographics.  The \nDivision may adopt regulations to require the physician or pharmacist to report \nother  information,  as  long  as  it  is  not  personally  identifiable.  All  such \ninformation submitted is deemed confidential. \n \nSection 23 states the responsibilities of the Division, including compiling an \nannual report with the number of patients for whom a prescription is written, \nthe number who self-administer the drug, the drugs prescribed, the frequency \neach  drug  was  prescribed,  aggregate  patient  demographics  and  the  rate  of \ndeath per 10,000 deaths. The Division must report on the internet and submit \nto  the  Legislative  Counsel  Bureau,  which  will  be  transmitted  to  the  Interim \nHealth Committee or to the Legislature, depending on the year. \n \nSection 24 states physicians, psychologists and pharmacists who participate in \nthe process described in S.B. 165 are not subject to professional discipline and \ndo not violate applicable standards of care if they adhere to the safeguards and \nthe standards of care set out in the law. \n \nSection  25  states  the  death  of  a  patient,  under  the  protocol  described  in \nS.B. 165, is not a suicide or homicide and may not be reported as such.  \n \nSection 26 prohibits any person from requiring a patient to make or revoke a \nrequest for the prescription as a condition of receiving health care.  \n \nSection  27  states  it  is  unlawful  for  any  person  to  forge  a  request  for  a \nprescription described in this piece of legislation, exert undue influence on an ill \nperson  to  request  such  a  prescription  or  encourage  an  ill  person  to \nself-administer the life-ending drug. \n \nSection  28  provides  important  protections  of  conscience  for  attending \nphysicians  and  consulting  physicians  who  are  not  required  to  provide  such \nprescriptions to their patients.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 8 \n \nSection 29 provides the same protections to the owners and operators of health \ncare facilities. It provides details about health care facilities and how they may \nopt out and the steps to follow in order to do so. \n \nSection  30  includes  the  dispensing  of  a  controlled  substance  within  the \ndefinition of medical treatment. \n \nSection 31 excludes the activities set forth in S.B. 165 from drug trafficking \nstatutes. \n \nSection 32 allows a person to self-administer and possess the drug pursuant to \nSection 21. \n \nSection 33 provides that on the effective date of S.B. 165, a will requiring a \nperson to request, or prohibiting a person from requesting, a prescription as \ndescribed in this bill, is unenforceable and is void. \n \nSection 34 provides a person is not deemed to need a guardian based solely on \ntheir request for, or revocation of, a request for a prescription designed to end \ntheir life. \n \nSection  35  excludes  these  records  from  public  record  laws,  ensuring \nconfidentiality.  \n \nSection  36  limits  the  provisions  of  this  bill  to  attending  physicians  only, \nalthough there are other health care providers who may prescribe controlled \nsubstances under other circumstances. \n \nSection 37 reinforces that prescriptions are not public records and must not be \ndivulged  by  pharmacists  except  under  certain  circumstances,  including  the \nreport  to  the  Nevada  Division  of  Public  and  Behavioral  Health  described  in \nsection 22. \n \nSections 38-40 deal with insurance and provide insurers writing life insurance, \nor  group  life  insurance,  may  not  deny  a  claim,  cancel  a  policy  or  impose \nadditional charges. They may not refuse to sell or issue a policy or charge a \nhigher  rate  to  cover  a  person  solely  because  the  insured  has  requested  or \nrevoked a request for a prescription designed to end their life.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 9 \n \nSection  41  specifies  legislative  reports  submitted  pursuant  to  this  act  are \nexempt from the requirements in Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 218D.380. \n \nSection 42, the final section, states the act becomes effective upon passage \nand approval. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWe are concerned as to what \"competent\" means in section 5. We all know \nthat competence may vary depending on the circumstance. In section 12, the \n15  days  required  for  written  requests,  can  this  be  accomplished  through \ntelemedicine? \n \nDR. SANDEEN: \nA written request must be delivered to the attending physician, which would \nmean in person. I am unsure what Nevada telehealth statutes state.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIn  our  opioid  laws,  we  have  a  genuine  relationship  with  the  doctor.  This \nlegislation does not elaborate on this. Not that this would happen in Oregon, but \nobviously some people in Nevada may be going to Oregon and seeking out a \ndoctor who will allow them to die the way they would like. I suspect some of \nthat tourism effect may come to us if we do not have that relationship with a \nperson. The person wanting to participate in physician-assisted suicide would \nnot be face to face, as a written request is first required, followed by another \nwritten request 15 days later. The same written request requires two witnesses; \none who is not a relative to the person, meaning one interested person, and \none disinterested person. Am I understanding that correctly? \n \nDR. SANDEEN: \nThat is correct, one disinterested person. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nOne  of  them  could  well  be  interested  or  have  that  conflict  of  interest.  In \nsection 13, subsection 2:  \n \nIf a patient resides in a facility for long-term care or a facility for \nhospice  care  at  the  time  the  patient  makes  a  written  request \npursuant  to  this  section,  one  of  the  witnesses  described  in \nparagraph (b) of subsection 1 must be designated to serve as a \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 10 \n \nwitness  by  the  facility  and  may  include,  without  limitation,  an \nombudsman, a chaplain or a social worker.  \n \nThe patient receives 120 days of skilled care coverage from Medicare. When \nthat  runs  out,  the  facility  also  cares  for  that  patient  financially.  Could  that \nfacility  wishing  to  facilitate  this  patient  in  ending  their  life  be  one  of  the \nwitnesses, or would that be a conflict of interest? \n \nDR. SANDEEN: \nOne of the reasons this bill requires a witness from a facility is due to the \nunderlying  principle  that  this  is  voluntary  for  everyone  involved,  including  a \nhealth care institution. We are mandating that a health care institution has one \nof  the  persons  as  a  witness,  so  they  know  that  it  is  taking  place  in  their \nproperty.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIf this is happening in a facility, would you be able to say they must notify the \nperson, as opposed to one of the witnesses, because it is a direct conflict of \ninterest as the facility has a vested interest in having that person move on?  \n \nDR. SANDEEN: \nThe reason this is in the bill is because it provides the facility the opportunity to \nbe informed.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIn  section  15,  when  a  person  revokes  their  request,  what  happens  to  the \nmedication they currently have that will allegedly by law be destroyed? I am \nunsure what the law is that states we must destroy this medication. Is there a \nlaw in Nevada that states the medication must be returned after the request is \nrevoked? We do not want a patient revoking their request and have a person \nwith a conflict of interest obtaining the medication and inadvertently giving it to \nanother person.  \n \nDR. SANDEEN: \nWe are very concerned about controlled substances available to the general \npopulation. In states and jurisdictions providing death with dignity, people do \nnot  fill  the  prescription  until  they  intend  to  use  them,  as  it  is  exceedingly \nexpensive. We do not have the prescriptions available to the general public. In \nthe event that someone is fortunate enough to be able to afford the medication, \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 11 \n \nas they feel the prescription gives them peace of mind, and they unfortunately \ndie of their underlying condition before having the opportunity to ingest the \nmedication, the prescription must be destroyed according to Nevada law.  \n \nI  have  met  with  individuals  stating  there  are  take  back  situations  where \nmedications can be returned to be destroyed where legal. It is legal under their \nfederal  guidelines  related  to  destruction  and  who  can  possess  controlled \nsubstances. I have been told Nevada law has the ability to authorize this and it \ndoes happen in your towns and communities. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWith  regard  to  my  comment  on  competency,  have  you  an  answer  for  that \ncomment about the varying periods of competency? How do you handle this in \nOregon? \n \nDR. SANDEEN: \nCompetence is a multi-faceted issue. The way we have addressed this issue in \nthe  piece  of  legislation  before  you  is  to  ask  two  physicians  to  determine \ncompetence.  If  they  have  any  question  whether  there  is  concern  with \ncompetence, the patient must be referred to a psychiatrist or psychologist for \nevaluation. Before the physician may write the prescription, he or she again \nmust  determine  competence.  At  the  end  of  the  two  waiting  periods,  the \nphysician  must  again  determine  competence  before  the  prescription  can  be \nwritten.  This  is  what  we  have  done  statutorily  to  address  the  issue  of \ncompetence.  \n \nWhat happens in Oregon and Washington demonstrates about 90 percent of \npatients requesting and ingesting medications through death with dignity are \nalso enrolled in hospice; they are receiving health care. When enrolled in hospice \nyou have entire teams addressing all of your health issues. We know these \npatients are receiving quality health care as an indicator their mental health \nissues are being addressed through that vector. There are indications we are \nlooking at competence in the implementation happening after the structure of \nthe policy you have in front of you. \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nSection 1 states the person who signs the death certificate specifies the cause \nof death as the primary disease. I am wondering if Nevada may run afoul of \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 12 \n \nfederal laws where Medicare is asking for specific language, due to Medicare \nfraud. I want to make sure that is not happening. \n \nDR. SANDEEN: \nThis does not run afoul of any federal legislation. We have had this law in \nOregon with the same standards for 20 years and not encountered this. In \nWashington,  they  have  had  this  legislation  since  2008,  and  have  not \nencountered this. A patient is hastening an already impending death, already \ngoing to pass from this condition. What goes on the death certificate is the \nunderlying condition leading to the person's death.  \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nSection 12, subsection 6, speaks to coercion and undue influence. \n \nThere is a court case out of Oregon involving a Kate Cheney. She had early \nonset dementia, and although she was of sound mind, her daughter asked her \nmother to see a physician for medication to end her life. They contacted a \ndifferent physician for a second opinion who ordered a psychiatric evaluation. In \nour law, she lacked the high level capacity required to weigh the options. The \nrequest was denied and her daughter became angry. Another evaluation took \nplace,  and  the  psychiatrist  deemed  her  mother  competent  while  noting  her \nchoices might be influenced by her family's wishes and the daughter's coercion. \nShe took the medications prescribed and passed away.  \n \nSafeguards are what I am worried about. Senate Bill 165 states we are going to \nmake sure there is no coercion or undue influence, which is hard to determine. \nAre we sure we are stringent enough in these safeguards? \n \nDR. SANDEEN: \nThe case of Ms. Cheney is well-documented; it is not a case of which I have \npersonal knowledge. I can only share my knowledge from the documentation I \nhave  read.  The  conclusions  have  always  been  that  in  the  end,  she  was \ncompetent to make the decision and there was no report to the medical board. \nThere were no difficulties associated with any court cases, and this case has \nbeen examined very carefully in Oregon as is set out in the law. Some consider \nthis a failure of the Oregon law; I consider this a success. Competency was \nevaluated very closely, it was looked at in several venues and vetted as a case \nstudy  in  a  peer  review  medical  journal.  It  was  determined  there  was  an \nappropriate prescription given. We consider this the way Oregon and Nevada \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 13 \n \nlaws would shine a light on this process and require when difficult issues of \ncompetency arise there are multiple steps that are followed.  \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nI  would  ultimately  like  to  see  the  coercion  issues  addressed.  Section  12, \nsubsection 3 states you must be a resident of the State. I understand residency \nto be living in the State for a month.  \n \nThe bill also states if someone knows they are within six months of their life \nending, they can request the medication to end their life. If Nevada's residency \nrequirement is only one month, I am worried we are going to have more people \nrelocating  to  Nevada,  coining  suicide  tourism  and  requesting  end  of  life \nmedications. Perhaps we need to say residents need to be here for six months \nin order to make that request. \n \nSENATOR PARKS: \nIt  is  my  understanding  in  most  other  states  the  residency  requirement  of \n30 days is the standard. This being our legislation, I believe we could take that \ninto consideration as to whether we may want to do things differently.  \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nMy  question  is  regarding  palliative  care.  Can  you  describe  this  and  what \nmedications are used in palliative care? \n \nDR. SANDEEN: \nPalliative care is an area of medicine that has arisen to address quality of life, \nmostly at the end of life. It is meant to ensure someone's quality of life is \nvalued as much as treatment, especially at the end of life, to ensure people's \npain is fully controlled. We consider unaddressed pain as a medical emergency, \nensuring people's pain is controlled, or making sure someone's anxiety at the \nend  of  life  is  addressed.  We  think  of  palliative  medicine  as  comfort  care, \nensuring quality of life is provided at the end of life. The big provider in palliative \ncare is hospice, a Medicare beneficiary-specific type of palliative medicine. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nSo this care is given at the request of the family or patient? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 14 \n \nDR. SANDEEN: \nYes, that is correct. Palliative medicine would be given voluntarily at the request \nof the patient. If a patient is unable to make a request, and they have someone \nmaking  decisions  for  them,  that  person  would  request  the  palliative  care. \nPalliative medicine would also be available on request, as it would be a standard \nof care to ensure the quality of life is administered if he or she cannot make \ndecisions. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nIs a psychiatrist required to determine they are competent at that time? \n \nDR. SANDEEN: \nNo that is not required. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nMy questions are around the extent to which this process has been used in \nother states. I want to ensure we are not opening Pandora's box and those who \ndeserve care will not get care, as this will be an option. I need to understand the \nnumbers we are talking about, the scope and scale.  \n \nDR. SANDEEN: \nThe Oregon Health Department statistics show 90 percent of those involved \nwith the process are enrolled in hospice. We know they are receiving solid \nmedical care; this is not a group of individuals not receiving medical care. A \nvery high number, between 90 percent and 95 percent in Oregon, have health \ninsurance.  This  is  before  the  Affordable  Care  Act.  These  are  numbers  that \nextend to before we were attempting to cover health care for everyone. These \nfolks have health insurance, access to physicians and have access to good \nquality end of life care. They are not seeking death with dignity as an alternative \nto care, it is running in tandem with care. Death with dignity is part of an end of \nlife option, not an alternative to treatment at the end of life.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDo we have a sense of numbers? \n \nDR. SANDEEN: \nIn Oregon, just over 1,000 people over 20 years have used the law. This is a \nvery low number of individuals every year seeking to use death with dignity. \nThis is a rarely used option at the end of life. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 15 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nHow do you do your prescription monitoring program as we have ICD-10 codes \nin  which  we  state  what  the  controlled  substance  is  for.  What  are  your \nrequirements for prescribing and filling prescriptions? \n \nDR. SANDEEN: \nMy knowledge of this is cursory. I am reluctant to go into details that I am not \naware of.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nSection 25 shows the act does not constitute suicide or homicide. Did you have \nto change your death certificate forms to include the reason for the death and \nlist the diagnoses leading to the ultimate cause of death?  \n \nDR. SANDEEN: \nOur forms were not changed. The patient dies from the underlying condition. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe patient did not die from the underlying condition; they died from taking the \nmedication prescribed to end their life, which would technically be an overdose. \n \nDR. SANDEEN: \nThe way Oregon looks at this, and the way Nevada would look at this, is the \npatient dies from the underlying condition. The death was hastened, but the \nunderlying condition brought about the death. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nSection 29 protects the facility or owner of the  facility from prohibiting an \nemployee  from  participating.  This  gives  them  the  same  protection  as  the \nphysician, nurse or pharmacist, so they are not mandated to participate in the \nprocess, is this correct? \n \nDR. SANDEEN: \nYes, that is correct. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWhen we use the word advanced practice nurses; is this intended to go beyond \nthe physician, physician assistant, medical assistant, we know as in NRS 630 \nand NRS 633?  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 16 \n \nDR. SANDEEN: \nSection  36  of  the  bill  states  NRS  639.1375  is  amended  to  the  advanced \npractice registered nurse, not limiting the provisions of the bill to the attending \nphysician only. \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nYou mentioned what the laws were in Oregon. I have found statistics reporting \nin  the  last  15  years  the  suicide  rate,  according  to  the  Centers  for  Disease \nControl and Prevention, has gone up about 23 percent here in the United States. \nIn that same time frame in Oregon, it has gone up about 48 percent. How many \npeople have been denied the medication once it has been requested? \n \nDR. SANDEEN: \nOregon does not track denials of those that do not qualify for the medication. \nSuicide  is  a  complicated  thing,  and  I  will  assert  the  rise  since  Oregon  has \nenacted death with dignity, and the increased number of suicides, is a spurious \ncorrelation. There is no relationship; the numbers did go up at the same time, \nbut there is no evidence there is a relationship. There was a journal article \npublished  that looked at this  relationship statistically and it was  determined \nthere is no statistical relationship between death with dignity in Oregon and the \nrise in the number of suicides in our state. This number is not borne out as a \nstatistical relationship; there is no evidence that one caused the other.  \n \nA national organization that looks at suicide has come to the conclusion that \ndeath with dignity does not lead to suicide. It is not part of the increase in \nsuicide.  \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nNot having read all the journals you have spoken about, I am going to vote on \npolicy for those who live in this State. My underlying worry is coercion and \nundue influence. When you talk about verbal requests, nowhere does it state \nthe person requesting must be there in person. Do they have to be there in \nperson or can they call in a request, for example, telemedicine? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe spoke about this earlier and I believe the answer was Dr. Sandeen was not \nfamiliar with telehealth laws in our State, so I will ask legal counsel to look into \nthat question for us. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 17 \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nCan I ask him to look into whether there is intention to allow someone to call in \nversus in person, or is it the intention they be there in person? \n \nDR. SANDEEN: \nThe Nevada law was based on the Oregon law which was written 20 years ago, \nand there was no telemedicine at that time, so the request has to be made in \nperson. \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nYou mentioned that of the two witnesses, one could not be related to the \npatient. Does that mean one could be related to the person and have financial \ngain? \n \nCHAIR RATTI:  \nI believe this question was asked by Senator Hardy. \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nThis issue is also being addressed in the New Mexico Legislature, stating if a \npatient is looking at an illness that could terminate their life within six months \nthey would be able to start the procedure. They used a different term, in the \n\"foreseeable future.\" I want to make sure this is not step one to later looking at \nremoving language stating six months for someone looking at a terminal illness \nin the \"foreseeable future.\"  \n \nDR. SANDEEN: \nThis concerns me as well. I am interested in this being a limited option available \nto a limited number of people. My organization has fought diligently to maintain \nthe six months as a standard. To the point of the New Mexico legislation, we \nrecommended and could not go on record as supporting this legislation until \nthey amended it to have a six month diagnosis. \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nIf a physician refers a patient for psychiatric review, it only asks the psychiatrist \nhave one visit with the patient. Is this correct? \n \nDR. SANDEEN: \nThe psychiatrist or psychologist must follow his or her standard of care for \nestablishing competence as they have been trained, and what Nevada requires. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 18 \n \nThe number is not up to us to put in statute. Therefore, we left it to those two \ngroups of individuals as this is what they do in practice. \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nThe  other  safeguard  that  is  worrisome  is  insurance.  If  a  patient  makes  the \ndecision they want assisted suicide through this method, I am worried insurance \ncompanies  are  going  to  deny  insurance.  It  will  be  established,  in  certain \ncategories, the patient is terminal and there is nothing that can be done, even \nthough  the  insurance  company  could  give  them  the  coverage  to  help  them \novercome or extend their life. Are there additional safeguards we could look at \nto ensure insurance companies do not deny coverage? \n \nDR. SANDEEN: \nThis bill does codify the steps that are inherent in medicine. Going to see a \nphysician  for  a  second  opinion  is  part  of  medicine,  as  is  a  referral  to  a \npsychiatrist is part of medicine. There are things written in this bill that dictate \nthose  pieces  we  are  already  familiar  with  in  medicine.  We  also  depend  on \nmedicine to do its job well. Nevada has a strong statute about medicine and a \nstrong medical board.  \n \nWe currently have no health care system where people can be denied for their \nterminal illness. When we think about insurance companies denying insurance \ncoverage because of death with dignity, these people no longer want health \ncare.  \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nSection 28 has the physician or pharmacist \"escape clause.\" Nurses were not \nincluded there. Is this needed? \n \nDR. SANDEEN: \nNurses are not technically involved in this process. We do know that nurses \nprovide support to doctors, but in terms of the details of this process there is \nnot a nurse involved. \n \nERIC ROBBINS (Committee Counsel): \nI am unable to locate any specific Nevada law on how pharmaceuticals are to be \ndisposed.  I  believe  that  provision  is  primarily  aimed  at  saying  the  laws \nconcerning  controlled  substances  and  hazardous  materials  would  apply  if \nsomeone was found to be in possession of these materials. The executors of \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 19 \n \nthe estate would have to find a way to dispose of the drugs in a manner that no \none  was  in  unauthorized  possession  of  them  and  did  not  create  an \nenvironmental hazard.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWould this apply if a patient was to pass and they had a significant supply of \nopioids that had been prescribed, or any other controlled substance prescribed? \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nYes. I would like to point out that NRS 453.333 states it is murder if someone \nwas to furnish a controlled substance that is then used in someone's death.  \n \nTelehealth issues do not contain any expressed limitations on services that can \nbe  provided  through  telehealth.  As  long  as  the  service  does  not  require  a \nphysician to be physically present, it could be provided via telehealth. Medical \nethics and scope of practice limitations would apply. If the services in this bill \ncould be ethically provided via telehealth, there is nothing that would limit that. \nIf the intent was they must be provided in person, I would advise amending the \nbill to include a specific provision to that effect. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThere is language you could add to this bill to make it an exception to add \ntelehealth in NRS? \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nExactly. \n \nDR. ROBERT RABKIN: \nI will read from my written testimony in favor of S.B. 165 (Exhibit C).  \n \nDR. CHARLES HELD: \nI will read from my written testimony in favor of S.B. 165 (Exhibit D). \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN:  \nI have a question about morphine and palliative care. What does morphine do \nother than calm the pain? Does it have any other effect on the body? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 20 \n \nDR. HELD: \nMorphine  helps  with  pain  relief,  is  sedating  and  has  a  secondary  effect  of \nsuppressing respirations. It has been long accepted, including by the Catholic \nChurch. The secondary effect, which might, in fact, hasten death, is allowed in \nthe context of relieving suffering.  \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nMorphine not only calms pain, but a secondary effect would be respiratory? \n \nDR. HELD: \nYes, it suppresses breathing. It has a direct suppressive effect on the central \nrespiratory centers in the brain. Given enough morphine, any of us would stop \nbreathing. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nIs there something in place for the person who is in hospice and has requested \npalliative care? \n \nDR. HELD: \nYes, although I am not a hospice physician, I did have experience with my \nfather  in  hospice.  They  gave  him  the  necessary  amounts  of  medication  to \nalleviate  his  pain,  even  though  near  the  end  of  his  life,  it  more  than  likely \ncontributed to his death by making his breathing shallow and ultimately, he \nstopped breathing. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nPalliative care, in a roundabout way, relieves the pain some of these people are \ntrying to get out of.  \n \nDR. HELD: \nMy distinction between death with dignity and palliative care is that palliative \ncare is ongoing until the patient dies of their underlying disease. The Death with \nDignity Act allows someone, at a point in time once they have been determined \nto be within six months of death, to stop all care, take the medication and pass \nat that point in time. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nAs  a  pulmonologist,  you  understand  the  concept  of  air  hunger  that  people \nexperience  as  they  are  dying.  Morphine  relieves  air  hunger  and  leads  to \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 21 \n \nrespiratory depression. That air hunger is well-alleviated in a palliative way in \norder to facilitate the stopping of their breathing.  \n \nDR. HELD:  \nYes, that is true. \n \nDEBBIE BLACK: \nI testified in favor of S.B. 165 in 2017 and am in support of it today. I have \nbeen living with metastatic breast cancer for nine years and am blessed to say I \nhave no evidence of the disease. I want to be able to spend my last days and \nhours with my family and friends able to celebrate life, and when I feel the time \nhas come, I should be able to make the choice of how I end my life, rather than \nlet the cancer take me. I want to leave this life knowing I was in peace with \nsuffering  and  died  with  some  dignity,  not  only  for  myself,  but  also  for  my \nfamily. I hope you will consider what I have said and make this possible for \nothers living with a terminal disease. \n \nASHLEY CARDENAS (Compassion & Choices): \nI am here representing Compassion & Choices in support of S.B. 165 and will \nread from my written testimony (Exhibit E). \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nWe  heard  previously  there  was  no  correlation  between  the  numbers  in \nphysician-assisted  suicide  and  suicide  in  the  United  States.  I  have  found \ninformation on a new study stating there is a correlation. Controlling various \nsocio-economic factors unobservable in the State in specific linear trends, we \nfind  that  legalizing  physician-assisted  suicide  was  associated  with  the \n6.3 percent increase in total suicides. There is some evidence that suggests it \ndoes increase. You have stated you can easily refute that evidence. We may be \njumping to the conclusion there is no alternative.  \n \nDAN DIAZ (Compassion & Choices): \nI am the husband of Brittany Maynard. Brittany died on November 1, 2014 in \nPortland, Oregon. We are Californians, but had to move to Oregon so Brittany \nwould have access to medical aid in dying, in order to ensure her dying process \nwas  gentle  should  it  become  necessary  for  her.  On  New  Year's  Day  we \ndiscovered her brain tumor. The tumor was very large and there was no cure. \nThe  eight  hour  surgery  she  endured  at  the  University  of  California,  San \nFrancisco Medical Center was able to remove only 35 percent of the tumor. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 22 \n \nThere are areas of the brain that cannot be operated on. We researched every \ntreatment option that was available, but the tumor was growing aggressively, \nand had we stayed in California, the tumor would have ended Brittany's life in a \nhorrific manner.  \n \nTo be clear, the terminally ill person who applies for this option is not deciding \nbetween living and dying. This is not a right to life or right to choose issue. The \noption of living was no longer on the table for Brittany. Her option was between \ntwo different methods of dying. One  would be  gentle; the other filled with \nunrelenting pain. The assertion by any physician that in 100 percent of the \ncases we can control an individual's pain and suffering at the end of life is not \ntrue. That would be irresponsible. I will line up scores of physicians to refute \nany such arrogant claim. My wife, Brittany, refused to accept the paternalistic \nview of a physician telling the patient when they have suffered enough and \nhooking them up to a morphine drip to potentially die a frightening death. \n \nNationwide, 72 percent of the population agrees that a terminally ill individual \nshould have this option at the end of life. The support here in Nevada is slightly \nhigher than that. Nationwide support among Catholics is 70 percent; I say that \nas  a  Catholic.  While  the  church  leadership  may  have  a  position  of  being \nopposed, the congregants agreed with Brittany that a terminally ill individual \nshould have this option at the end of life. I am here testifying for this legislation, \nbecause it is a promise I made to my wife before she died. No one in Nevada \nshould have to leave their home and move to another state as we did in order to \nhave this option.  \n \nThere were a few questions that were asked where you were not provided with \na satisfactory answer. Regarding the terminology, a person pursuing the option \nof physician-assisted suicide is not suicidal. Brittany wanted to live; a suicidal \nperson wants to die. A person who is suicidal is depressed, despondent and \nmaking irrational decisions. Brittany was none of those things. She was safely \ntaking the control back from her brain tumor so she could have a say in how her \nfinal days would play out.  \n \nThis legislation for the first time protects the most vulnerable in our society, the \nelderly and disabled, because their voices are heard. This legislation requires the \nconversation be had. Only the terminally ill individual can sit across from their \nphysician and request this. It cannot be done by proxy or by power of attorney. \nSecobarbital is a medication that is primarily used; it is a sleeping medicine. It \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 23 \n \nhas been around for over 80 years. In Brittany's case, the prescription was for \n100 capsules which had to be opened, the powder emptied into a glass mixed \nwith 4-5 ounces of water, and Brittany had to be able to consume that on her \nown. It was not administered to her.  \n \nIn the absence of this legislation, we had in our possession dilaudid, which is \nfour  times  stronger  than  morphine.  Fifty  secobarbital  would  be  200  mg  of \ndilaudid, the equivalent of 800 mg of morphine. I am 190 pounds, which is \nenough to put me to sleep for good. Why stop there? There are 240 in the \nbottle so I could certainly get the job done. For the terminally ill individual or \nanyone to qualify for this, they simply have to be in pain. There is no process, \nno  two  physicians  scrutinizing  the  individual  establishing  their  mental \ncompetency,  making  sure  they  are  not  simply  going  through  a  bout  of \ndepression. They determine the patient has qualified for the secobarbital.  \n \nWhen Brittany received her prescription, she put it away and focused on living \nher life. The goal is always to live as long as you possibly can. This program \nsimply allowed Brittany to ensure she did not have to suffer what the brain \ntumor was already doing to her; pain not even dilaudid could alleviate. The \nseizures were increasingly more frequent and severe. She was unable to sleep \nfor days on end, and the nausea and vomiting were getting worse. Coming \nnext, as the tumor would continue to grow, it would put pressure on other parts \nof the brain and she would lose her eyesight or eventually go blind. If she were \nto suffer a stroke, depending on what part of the brain is damaged due to lack \nof oxygen, she would be partially paralyzed and die a suffering mass in bed. \nBrittany said no, I refuse to die that way. She would rather live as long as she \npossibly can, and if and when she gets to a point where modern medicine is \nunable to keep her comfortable, she can say I love you to the people in the \nroom and pass away gently.  \n \nUnfortunately  in  the  last  four  years,  as  I  have  testified  in  support  of  this \nlegislation, I am unsure of how many family members I have had come to me \nand  tell  me  they  did  not  do  it  by  hoarding  medications.  I  was  just  in \nNew Mexico and a woman provided testimony that her mother, who had never \nhandled  a  gun,  simply  got  the  shotgun  belonging  to  her  husband  and  shot \nherself. That is not health care. This legislation for the first time will protect \npatients as it allows physicians to address whatever portion of that individual's \ncare is not being addressed. Because it forces the conversation, the physician \nnow has the opportunity to say I need to speak with my colleagues, you do not \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 24 \n \nqualify for medical aid to die and are nowhere near six months end of life. There \nare parts of your care that are not being addressed and let us take care of those \nso a person does not reach the level of thinking they need to get a firearm.  \n \nThe  law  in  New  Mexico  states  there  must  be  a  six  month  prognosis.  The \nlanguage you mentioned earlier was in the bill initially and we requested it be \nchanged to a six month prognosis and the bill was amended to do so. \n \nThe idea that insurance will withhold treatment and instead offer the \"bait and \nswitch\"; there has not been a documented case where someone has said we \nare going to withhold this treatment.  \n \nThe only option available to any terminally ill individual, in any state across the \nCountry, is that of terminal sedation. That is the medical practice of putting a \nperson  into  sedation,  withholding  food  and  water  until  that  person  dies  of \ndehydration and the effects of the underlying disease. I have seen that play out \nfirst hand.  \n \nThere  was  a  question  on  the  use  of  morphine.  Unfortunately,  that  is  what \nsometimes happens behind closed doors, utilizing medication like secobarbital \nwhere a family member may say we have the medication, why not increase the \ndosage. That is unfortunately what can happen right now, versus once this \nlegislation is passed, that terminally ill patient is in control. \n \nJOHN  FUDENBERG  (Coroner,  Office  of  the  Coroner/Medical  Examiner,  Clark \nCounty): \nI am presenting and will review (Exhibit F) a proposed amendment to S.B. 165. \n \nThe intent of the language added to section 22, subsection 4, was to make sure \nwhen we as law enforcement or the coroner's jurisdictions respond to a death \nscene, we would have access to the database to determine whether or not the \ndecedent did, in fact, get prescribed the medication. \n \nThe language added to section 24, subsection 4, after speaking with our civil \ndistrict  attorney  representative,  was  added  because  there  are  3  sections \npreceding that have some protection for different folks.  \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nAre you saying that is going to be subsection 4 of section 24? \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 25 \n \nMR. FUDENBERG: \nThat is correct, subsection 4 is a new subsection. \n \nThe purpose for that protection is that we have other legislation that requires us \nto take jurisdiction over these types of deaths, and rule those suicides. We want \nto ensure when we are following the law and not ruling them suicides, we have \nsome  protection  against  other  family  members  not  supporting  the  assisted \nsuicide and bringing action against the county or the coroner with that county. \n \nWe are having a difficult time understanding how section 25, subsection 1, \nwould  happen  in  reality.  If  we  respond  to  a  death  scene  with  a  decedent, \nwhether  accompanied  by  a  family  member  or  friend,  we  have  no  way  of \nverifying they did, in fact, die from the ingestion of that prescription. We want \nto make it clear, although we may respond to the scene, we will not take \njurisdiction and will not be held to certifying the death.  \n \nOne of the issues we have with death with dignity folks is ensuring these types \nof deaths are not ruled suicides and do not fall under the jurisdiction of a county \ncoroner,  putting the family through an  autopsy.  We feel this section  would \nminimize that and take care of the Coroner's Office not handling the certification \nof death and ruling them suicides. \n \nJAIME RODRIGUEZ (Office of the County Manager, Washoe County): \nOur medical examiner has the same concerns Mr. Fudenberg covered. We are \nhere in support of Clark County's amendment to the bill. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWith 20 years of experience in Oregon, how does their process work? \n \nMR. FUDENBERG: \nI am unaware of how their process works. I have heard from different offices in \nOregon and have been told these deaths are not reported to the coroner and \nmedical examiner's office in Oregon, so they are not involved. In Clark County, \nif it is an unattended death and it happens in a residence and the decedent is \nnot on hospice care, we do respond to the death. I am also unaware if the \npolice have a way of verifying the decedent was someone prescribed the end of \nlife prescription and not call us. We want to make sure if we are called, we are \nat least covered and not have to certify the death. Under our other statutes, we \nhave to certify these deaths as suicides and that defeats the purpose of this bill.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 26 \n \nHOLLY WELBORN (American Civil Liberties Union, Nevada): \nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada strongly supports the right of an \nindividual who is terminally ill to make the deeply personal decision to end his or \nher life, and how that person will face those final days. This includes support for \nthe patient's right to ask a physician for help in carrying out their decision. The \nright of individual autonomy protects all people and the right to control their \nbodies during the course of their lives.  \n \nThere is also legal and transparent value in having aid in dying. States have \ncreated  and  tolerated  gray  markets  for  people  with  recourses  to  find \nsympathetic doctors to help them die peacefully. Other desperate patients try \nself-induced and sometimes unsuccessful methods for ending their lives.  \n \nBringing aid in dying out of the shadows creates an open process and gives \npatients with terminal diseases peace of mind knowing they can choose the \ntiming  of  their  own  death.  End  of  life  choice  is  already  recognized  as  an \naccepted legal principle. A competent adult's unqualified legal right to decline \nmedical care, even when the result is certain death, is universally accepted \nwhere clear and convincing evidence exists that the patient wished to end life \nsupport, such as through an advanced directive.  \n \nFinally,  aid  in  dying  laws  open  up  communication  between  the  doctor  and \npatient that promote the right of the patient to choose life. For example, in \nOregon only 1 in 25 patients who ask a physician about aid in dying actually \nrequest the medication. One third of the people who request the medication \nactually take it. This allows patients the freedom to discuss their fears openly \nand physicians can offer information on alternative forms of care. \n \nMACKENZIE BAYSINGER (Human Services Network): \nThe Human Services Network would like to express our support for S.B. 165 on \nthe basis of the National Association of Social Workers code of ethics. This \nincludes  the  obligation  to  give  particular  attention  to  the  needs  and \nempowerment of people who are vulnerable or oppressed. \n \nJASON HENKLE (Nevada Death with Dignity Action Project): \nAs far as the telehealth issue is concerned, I would say that as you have to be \neligible and receive a diagnosis as a terminally ill patient with a follow up, I am \nunsure this could be handled through strictly telemedicine. Moving beyond that \nprocess, perhaps the telemedicine statutes come into play.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 27 \n \nAs to Chairwoman Ratti's scope and scale argument, I have put together the \ndata from Oregon and Washington from the Nevada Death with Dignity Action \nProject and created a linear projection (Exhibit G) showing the kind of boundary \nanalysis we would see if this became law. According to the data from 1999 to \n2015,  on  average  we  would  see  146  Nevadans  participating  in  death  with \ndignity if it became enacted. \n \nI would like to clarify the latest data out of Oregon from 1998 to 2017 showing \n1,265 Oregonians participating in death with dignity. In Washington from 1995 \nto 2017 there were 926 participating. This makes a total of 2,191 participating \nin death with dignity. These statistics are updated every year with the latest \ninformation. Oregon, at the end of this week or early next week, will have a \nreport for 2017.  \n \nAs far as the medical examiner's concerns, we know when the prescriptions are \nissued there is going to be a return of unconsumed medications. This leads to \nthe statistics on why they chose to participate in death with dignity. I believe \nthat  return  process  will  help  address  some  of  the  concerns  of  the  medical \nexaminers. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThere are over 146 Nevadans participating per day, per year, for 20 years? \n \nMR. HENKLE: \nThis projection is 146 annually on average over 5 years. \n \nFRED VOLTZ: \nI believe terminally ill people who have been determined competent should be \nable to decide how they are going to live the rest of their lives. I strongly \nsupport S.B. 165.  \n \nI believe some of the objections that have been brought up can be overcome. I \nhave  three  issues  I  would  like  to  bring  up  to  enhance  the  bill  further.  In \nsection 14, page 7, there should be an affirmative understanding statement by \nthe  person  signing  this  about  their  own  life;  that  they  understand  the \nimplications their choice might have about life insurance coverage or annuities \nthey have. It could be a disclosure statement showing the implications that go \nalong with the form they are given. They may be referred to the State Insurance \nCommissioner to have the implications explained to them.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 28 \n \nIn section 38, subsection 2, most people with a terminal illness are not going to \nbe  issued  an  insurance  policy.  No  insurance  company  will  issue  one.  That \nparticular section may need to be removed. We may need a section added for \nthe  individual  with  a  life  insurance  policy  that  is  paid  for  and  no  renewal \nhappening and the policy is in force; hence a need for extra language covering \nthat eventuality.  \n \nSAM TOLL (Libertarian Party of Nevada): \nI am here representing the Libertarian Party of Nevada in support of S.B. 165. \nThis subject touches on one of the core principles of our party we hold very \ndear, the notion of self-ownership. Within the context of our lives, we believe \nthere is no more superior moral arbiter of what happens to us as individuals than \nourselves. We feel by depriving or having this option not on the table for people \nwho face troubling and very personal life ending situations, they may resort to \nless compassionate and comfortable means to end their lives.  \n \nKRISTEN HANSON (Patients' Rights Action Fund): \nI  am  here  representing  the  Patients'  Rights  Action  Fund  in  opposition  of \nS.B. 165 and will read from my written testimony (Exhibit H). \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nIn your estimation, do you feel the safeguards we have in this legislation that \npatients can be referred out of the psychological evaluation are adequate? \n \nMS. HANSON: \nOne of the reasons my husband felt so strongly he needed to speak out against \nassisted  suicide  was  he  saw  patients  as  vulnerable  as  he  was.  You  can \nexperience depression at any point following your diagnosis, not just when you \nrequest the lethal medication. In Oregon, less than 4 percent of patients are \nreferred out for psychological evaluation and we will never know how many of \nthem are actually depressed when they take the medication.  \n \nDR. T. BRIAN CALLISTER (Compassion & Choices): \nI am here representing Compassion & Choices in opposition to S.B. 165 and will \ncomment on portions of my written testimony I have submitted (Exhibit I).  \n \nThis is not about freedom, choice and autonomy. I am here as an interested \nphysician as I have experienced this. I am a past President of the State Medical \nAssociation and the Governor-Elect of the American College of Physicians. I had \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 29 \n \nno idea what this was about until this happened to me. My colleagues asked \nwhy I was so surprised, they did nothing illegal. They did not, but it is unethical \nin my mind.  \n \nUnending pain and suffering comes up time and again. In 20 years of Oregon \ndata, 20 percent of patients refer to pain, or the future concern of pain, as the \nreason  for  requesting  assisted  suicide.  I  would  also  point  out  that  the  top \nreasons,  burden  to  family,  loss  of  enjoyment,  usual  activities  and  loss  of \nautonomy are sad social issues. These are not a good reason to end your life \nprematurely,  especially  when  the  ability  to  predict  life  expectancy,  giving  a \nterminal diagnosis has an average error of 50 percent to 70 percent. \n \nMARILYN GOLDEN (Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund): \nI  am  here  representing  the  Disability  Rights  Education  and  Defense  Fund  in \nopposition to S.B. 165. I will read from my written testimony and reference the \nhandouts I have submitted (Exhibit J) and (Exhibit K). \n \nCONCETTA TEDESCO (Catholic Daughters of the Americas): \nI am here today in opposition to S.B. 165. What does it actually mean when a \nperson requests physician-assisted suicide? It is not only the physical pain, it \ncan mean other things such as loneliness or concern for being a burden to \nothers. I have an issue with a statement Dr. Sandeen made about patients being \nreferred to a psychiatrist or psychologist for competency only. I believe the bill \nshould include the patient be referred to a psychiatrist or psychologist as soon \nas medical staff notices a patient is depressed and requesting physician-assisted \nsuicide, not only for competency.  \n \nBELEN GABATO (Philippine Nurses Association of Nevada): \nI am here representing the Philippine Nurses Association of Nevada in opposition \nto S.B. 165. Our members believe we become arbiters of life and death in the \ncontinuum of life. We do not know the unintended consequences of this bill. We \npractice by the old dictum in the Hippocratic Oath, \"do no harm.\" We believe \nthis is the ultimate harm done to the patient. Until the issues raised today are \naddressed, you should have a public hearing the next time so all issues are \naddressed. We cannot support this bill in its present form. \n \nDR. WILLIAM FRANKELL: \nIf a person prior to becoming terminal has put in writing, such as in a will, their \ndesire to no longer receive treatment and pass away, that should be honored. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 30 \n \nAfter  someone  is  sick  or  terminal  their  mental  capacity  has  changed.  Their \nthinking  processes  have  altered.  This  issue  is  not  addressed  anywhere  in \nS.B. 165.  \n \nI  am  a  severely  disabled  person  who  is  on  numerous  medications  and  am \nconcerned if this bill passes there will be a financial issue with insurances, like \nMedicare  and  Medicaid,  to  slowly  begin  denying  medications.  I  have  had \nmedications denied due to cost. No one should be denied medication due to \ncost, especially when they are terminal. \n \nThe thought process of those who are terminal can change. If someone prior to \nbeing sick has stated in a will their desire for assisted suicide, that desire should \nbe  honored.  A  will  being  written  prior  to  one  being  sick  should  not  be \ninvalidated as stated in the bill.  \n \nI  believe  the  actual  cause  of  death  must  be  included  somewhere  in  the \npaperwork, not the underlying illness, but stating there was an assisted suicide. \n \nKATHLEEN ROSSI: \nI am opposed to S.B. 165 and will read from my written testimony (Exhibit L). \n \nDR. KIRK BRONANDER: \nI practice hospital medicine where I see patients on a daily basis and have \nconversations about end of life on at least a weekly basis. It is very difficult to \ngive a patient a terminal diagnosis and predict the prognosis of an illness. We \nare  often  wrong  in  this  prognosis.  It  is  extremely  difficult  to  give  someone \nsix months when you really do not know. It is a guess, and yet this law will \nmake you eligible to terminate your life if a doctor says you have six months left \nto live. It is a total guess on most occasions. Even cancer, which is probably the \neasiest, is quite difficult.  \n \nIt was stated in the law, we should depend on medicine to do well; we cannot \nalways depend on this. I trust most of my colleagues. I do not trust every \ndoctor in Nevada. You, as legislators, have had to deal with the opioid epidemic, \nas  have  we.  Opioids  are  the  most  regulated  medications  we  can  prescribe; \nhowever, the medications prescribed for death with dignity are not regulated by \nthe federal government. We will not know who is prescribing these medications, \nand it will not be stated on the death certificate.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 31 \n \nIt was also said patients need to seek hospice care. There are large parts of \nNevada where there is no hospice care. I spoke with a provider today in Eureka, \nNevada, and there is no hospice there. If we pass this law, they will not have \nhospice, but there will be the chance to kill yourself. I am in opposition to \nS.B. 165. \n \nDR. TIMOTHY DOYLE: \nI am a neurologist in Carson City and am opposed to S.B. 165 for several \nreasons. It certainly harms the practice of medicine itself. The American Medical \nAssociation  states  \"physician-assisted  suicide  is  fundamentally  incompatible \nwith  the  physician's  role  as  a  healer.  It  would  be  difficult  or  impossible  to \ncontrol and would pose societal risks.\"  \n \nIs it not ironic doctors who traditionally refuse to participate in the execution of \nconvicted prisoners are not being recruited to help kill the innocent? This bill \nestablishes a double standard of medical care for suicidal patients by targeting \nthose who are most vulnerable with terminal illnesses.  \n \nThe  University  of  California,  Irvine,  Professor  of  Psychiatry  Aaron  Kheriaty \nreports that 80 percent to 90 percent of suicides are associated with depression \nor other treatable mental illnesses. Yet only 1 in 20 who have died by assisted \nsuicide in Oregon were referred for psychiatric consultation before their deaths. \n\"This lack of basic psychological evaluation and treatment constitutes medical \nnegligence.\"  In  Nevada,  medical  license  renewal  for  psychiatrists  requires \nsuicide  prevention  and  awareness  education.  This  bill  promotes  suicide; \npsychiatrists promote suicide prevention. The reason psychiatrists do not see \nthese  patients  is  because  it  would  undermine  the  role  of  what  this  bill  is \npromoting. It is promoting suicide. \n \nROWENA HARRISON: \nI am a practicing hospice nurse in Washoe County and I oppose S.B. 165 and \nwill read from my written testimony (Exhibit M). \n \nFor a patient to be put on hospice, there has to be two doctors agreeing on the \nterminal diagnosis of six months. They have to be recertified multiple times and \nhave face to face visits by the physician, ensuring they are meeting criteria \nMedicare requires to maintain hospice care. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 32 \n \nAs was stated by Ms. Maynard's husband, there is terminal sedation available \nfor patients that have any kind of intractable symptoms. They can be admitted \nto the hospital and receive acute care.  \n \nWe are there for the patients. We are with patients and families when they are \ndying. We provide emotional, physical, spiritual and psychological support from \nsocial workers and chaplains as we are treating more than the patient; we are \ntreating the family.  \n \nTOM BAKER: \nI  will  read  from  my  written  testimony  submitted  in  opposition  to  S.B.  165 \n(Exhibit N). \n \nMARGARET DORE: \nI am an attorney from Washington State where assisted suicide and euthanasia \nare legal under a similar law. I am in opposition to S.B. 165 and have submitted \nwritten testimony (Exhibit O).  \n \nThe legislation you are considering allows euthanasia due to many reasons, one \nbeing the definition of self-administer. I want to make it clear we are talking \nabout people who have years or decades to live. I have a friend who was talked \nout  of  assisted  suicide  18  years  ago.  The  definition  of  self-administer  in \nS.B. 165 is not defined. It is defined in the Washington State bill as the act of \ningesting. The preamble to the bill also refers to ingesting a lethal dose.  \n \nThe death certificate creates the perfect crime. A person dies with a lethal dose, \nperhaps not voluntarily. They may be getting better and a family member knows \nthe medication is available in the home in case the illness worsens and they \ndecide to use the medication. The death certificate is going to show a natural \ndeath and the family inherits from the will. Senate Bill 165 is very explicit to \nallow insurance coverage in the event assisted suicide is the choice taken. This \nbill would allow legal murder. The death certificate is a get out of jail free card. \nThere will be a complete lack of transparency. \n \nDAVID WALKER: \nI am here in opposition to S.B. 165. I believe the bill sends the wrong message. \nNevada has a high teen suicide rate and I am afraid it degrades the dignity we \nshould have for life and the sacredness of life.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 33 \n \nI  have  not  heard  any  breakdown  on  the  assisted  suicides  for  men  versus \nwomen. I would suspect that it takes advantage of the vulnerable in our society, \npossibly  elderly  women.  I  would  be  disappointed  if  this  bill  would  cause  a \ndisproportionate amount of women taking their lives.  \n \nI show the concern Nevada would, like in the past, become the divorce refuge \nof the Nation. I would not like to see people coming to Nevada making an \nindustry out of it like we have a tendency to do throughout the Country. My \noverall concern is the dignity of living in Nevada and reducing the suicide rate \nand making people appreciate life and living, no matter how tough it gets. \n \nCATHERINE O'MARA (Nevada State Medical Association): \nI am here representing the Nevada State Medical Association. We are neutral on \nS.B. 165.  Our  neutral  testimony  should  not  reflect  we  have  a  divided \ndisagreement  in  our  membership.  This  is  a  very  difficult  issue  for  Nevada \nphysicians to deal with primarily because it is against the American Medical \nAssociation (AMA) Code of Ethics. When we try to balance the autonomy of the \npatient with ethics that have been endorsed by our Association, it is difficult to \nmarry those two, which is why we are neutral. \n \nPhysician-assisted  suicide  is  fundamentally  incompatible  with  the  physician's \nrole as healers. It would be difficult or impossible to control or would propose \nserious societal risks; this from the Code of Ethics. I am waiting for a letter from \nthe AMA to allow me to introduce copyrighted material in order to submit it for \nthe record.  \n \nEven though we are neutral, we have comments on issues brought up during \nthe  presentation.  We  would  be  opposed  to  any  use  of  telemedicine  in  this \nregard, and would like to be involved in conversations on this topic. We had \nconcerns about section 16 speaking to competency. Many physicians in Nevada \nbelieve  they  are  tasked  with  capacity  determinations,  not  competency \ndeterminations. For example, when someone is being designated as competent \nto  stand  trial,  it  is  not  only  a  psychiatrist,  it  is  a  super  specialty  within \npsychiatry. I alerted the proponents of the bill about this concern and we would \nbe happy to work with them on the language. That does seem to differ from our \ncurrent understanding of the physician's role relative to competency.  \n \nA comment was made stating this should follow the standard of care. It is not \ncurrently the standard of care. What you are doing is creating a new statutory \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 34 \n \nstructure to follow when patients are requesting physician-assisted suicide. We \nwould not want this to become the standard of care for all patients who are \nstruggling with terminal illness. We are neutral because this does not mandate \nphysicians do this; it is up to the physician's individual choice. As I mentioned, \nit is unethical under the AMA Code of Ethics, which we have adopted. We \nwould not want this to create a standard of care in the statute that later must \napply to all physicians treating all terminal patients.  \n \nDR. PETER FENWICK: \nAs a physician and having practiced medicine for over 50 years, 40 in Nevada, I \nam opposed to S.B. 165. I have had many patients die from many ailments, \nincluding Lou Gehrig's disease. I have patients die in the intensive care unit, in \nthe emergency room and I cannot live with the idea of actually killing a patient. I \nhave never had to do that and have never let a patient suffer. I have gone to \ntheir homes, gone to see them in the hospital and I have never let a patient \nsignificantly suffer. I do not see why we should pass this legislation. We have \nhospice care, palliative care, and if we have good physician care, patients do \nnot  have  to  suffer.  You  treat  the  families  as  well;  if  a  patient  suffers,  the \nfamilies suffer. \n \nI have never lied on a death certificate. If you do, that is a crime in my view. \nWe are told we cannot show suicide on a death certificate. If a patient takes \nmedication in order to die, they did not die of their underlying condition, they \ndied of suicide which should be on the death certificate to keep the statistics \ncorrect. \n \nHERB SANTOS, JR.: \nI am here to testify in opposition to S.B. 165 and will read from my submitted \nwritten testimony (Exhibit P). \n \nI hope there will not be a rush to vote on this, giving us the opportunity to \nprovide you with information about the effects of insurance in other states in \norder to make an informed decision. \n \nLISA BEDOTTO LAUGHLIN: \nI am here to testify in opposition to S.B. 165, and have submitted written \ntestimony (Exhibit Q). \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 35 \n \nTHERESA DEGRAFFENREID: \nI am here to testify in opposition to S.B. 165, and have submitted my written \ntestimony (Exhibit R). \n \nSection 38, subsection 3 of this bill seeks to go back in time and void provisions \nin life insurance contracts that may have been in place for many years. It is \nhighly  inappropriate  for  the  government  to  interfere  in  existing  business \ncontracts. \n \nBOB RUSSO: \nI would like to put on the record that I oppose S.B. 165. In my opinion, this bill \ngreatly diminishes the value that many of us have placed on human life. I have \nsome concerns that once assisted suicide becomes a medical treatment option, \ninsurance companies will favor this less costly option denying patients more \nexpensive and potentially life-saving preferences. This is a hardship for many \nwho cannot afford to purchase their own medical treatment choices. This could \nresult in inequality in treatment.  \n \nI also fear this bill will easily target other vulnerable members of our community \nsuch as the elderly, disabled, the depressed and those with controllable terminal \nconditions such as diabetes. Our aging elders are particularly vulnerable due to \ntheir declining health and mental capacity to make clear personal decisions. \nSome may choose doctor-prescribed suicide out of emotion, such as guilt, or \nconsidering themselves a burden to others.  \n \nLastly, to my knowledge, there are no provisions in this bill to ensure the patient \nis competent at the time the lethal drug is taken or that he or she knowingly and \nwillfully  took  the  drugs.  Due  to  this  lack  of  protection,  the  bill  would  put \npatients at an enormous risk.  \n \nMARY FECHNER: \nThe report from Oregon shows in 2017 there were 143 reported suicide deaths. \nOf those cases where a doctor was present, there were 24. The no provider \npresent number was 6 and of those, where it was unknown whether a provider \nwas present, was 89. The number of cases where the prescribing doctor was \npresent at the time of death was 23. Other provider present was 19 and other \ncare provider present was 101. We do not know who these other care providers \nwere. The psychiatric evaluations in 2017 in Oregon were 3.5 percent.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 36 \n \nJEAN SOKOL (Right to Life): \nI am here to testify in opposition to S.B. 165. It is well spelled out to help a \nperson take his or her own life. Would it not be a joy if there was a bill that \nspelled out the wonders of living life to its fullest until he or she is called home \nto God? I looked at the first few pages of the Declaration of Independence and \nthe Constitution of the United States. As paraphrased here, all men are created \nequal, they are endowed by their Creator with certain rights; life, liberty and \nhappiness. Everything I read was positive. Not so with S.B. 165, helping a \nperson to take his or her life is not positive. This is not a good bill for us or our \nNation. \n \nLYNN CHAPMAN (American Independent Party): \nI am representing the American Independent Party in opposition to S.B. 165. My \nmother died at home and her entire family was with her; she did not die alone. I \ncannot  imagine  her  dying  alone  because  she  was  in  pain.  I  did  search  the \ninternet and found an interesting item. There was a person with a sign stating \n\"Suicide does not end the chances of life getting worse. Suicide eliminates the \npossibility of it ever getting better.\" \n \nJANINE HANSEN (Nevada Families for Freedom): \nI am here representing Nevada Families for Freedom in opposition to S.B. 165. \nThis bill creates a culture of death, rather than one of compassion and care. We \nbelieve in the sanctity of human life. The Federalist Papers state: \n \nIf angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls \non  government  would  be  necessary.  In  framing  a  government \nwhich is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty \nlies in this; you must first enable the government to control the \ngoverned; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.  \n \nThis particular law will give, through government, an opportunity for abuse for \nthose who are vulnerable. It will also create a culture of death.  \n \nWhen my father was dying in the hospital, I was in charge of making decisions \nfor him. Every day I brought my children with me. It was one of the most \nvaluable educations they could have. As he was in intensive care, I told him I \nloved him, and he said I love you, the last words I heard from my father as it \ntook a couple of weeks for him to actually die. Those hours were very valuable \nto me and my children. Even though many are afraid of what happens in that \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 37 \n \nprocess, it is an important process to learn with compassion, that we can still \nlove  and  support  and  care  about  our  loved  one,  even  in  these  difficult \ncircumstances. \n \nDON NELSON (Pro-Life League of Nevada) \nI represent the Pro-Life League of Nevada and we are in opposition to S.B. 165. \nWe support life from conception to natural death. \n \nI had a family member who attempted at 18. I remember how devastating that \nwas. The medical people did everything they could to ensure that person would \nsurvive. We have all kinds of suicide prevention services in our Country because \nwe believe people's lives are valuable.  \n \nLanguage in the bill that states, \"those who have only six months to live,\" is \nmost concerning to me. These people may have a terminal illness. We have to \nsay they have lives worth living; we have to consent to that. We would not \nallow that to happen without providing resources if we did not believe this.  \n \nI believe the State has a duty to oppose a class of human beings who do not \nhave a life worth living. It stigmatizes that class and I fear it will create a duty \nto die or a duty to help people die. We need to look at this from a civil rights \nperspective. This stigmatizes a certain class of people who have less than six \nmonths  to  live  who  may  have  a  terminal  illness,  and  that  we  think  it  is \nappropriate they would want to take their own lives.  \n \nMELISSA CLEMENT (Nevada Right to Life): \nI have nothing to add to this incredible testimony. I would just like to register \nNevada Right to Life is opposed to S.B. 165. \n \nSENATOR PARKS: \nThis is not a partisan issue, it is an issue of personal choice for too many of our \nconstituents  when  faced  with  few  other  options.  This  is  an  issue  of \ncompassion, love and personal options for those who want to have control of \nthe last few months and moments of their lives.  \n \nThere are several things I would like for you to remember as you consider this \nlegislation. First, the patient is in control from the very first request, which the \npatient must make through the many steps and repeated requests up to the \ntime when the patient must self-administer the drug. These safeguards ensure \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 25, 2019 \nPage 38 \n \nthe  patient  is  in  charge  and  have  been  proven  successful  for  more  than \ntwo decades, ensuring the patient is not in any way forced into making this \ndecision.  \n \nThis law is not for everyone. The definition of terminal disease does not include \nthose with disabilities or suffering from mental illness, nor individuals who are \nsuicidal. The patient must be diagnosed within six months of death, which is \nthe same standard of care used to qualify a patient for hospice care and one \nthat is well known to physicians.  \n \nYou have heard much about the evil insurance companies today. This law does \nnot allow insurance companies to suggest this option in lieu of other treatment. \nThey  may  not  cancel,  change  or  invalidate  either  health  or  life  insurance \npolicies. In most cases, they will not know the patient has chosen the option of \nassisted  suicide.  We  have  strict  controls  in  the  bill  to  ensure  insurance \ncompanies are not involved in the process. No one is forced to participate. \nDoctors, pharmacists, hospital systems may all choose to opt out and never \nhave this conversation with their patients.  \n \nI would like to leave you with one final thought. This legislation includes many \nsafeguards,  as  well  as  the  fact  that  medical  aid  in  dying  has  been  safely \npracticed in those states that have enacted this for a combination of 40 years. \nNot a single case of abuse or coercion, nor any criminal or disciplinary charges \nhave ever been filed.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe have testimony (Exhibit S) in support of S.B. 165 from Sandy Coyle.

(BDR 38-199) \n \nNOVA  MURRAY  (Deputy  Administrator,  Division  of  Welfare  and  Supportive \nServices, Department of Health and Human Services): \nThe  Division  of  Welfare  and  Supportive  Services  (DWSS)  currently \nserves 89,000 child support cases, of those, 50,000 are in arrears. Last year, \nDWSS  collected  $221  million  for  Nevada's  families.  We  provide  five  basic \nservices:  locate  parents,  establish  paternity,  establish  financial  and  medical \nsupport, provide enforcement, and collect and distribute payments. This bill is \npart  of  a  collaborative  effort  through  strategic  planning  of  State  staff  and \nnine participating counties. They have been working towards the passage of this \nlegislation for the past three years. It will help provide support for families in \nNevada to achieve safe, stable and healthy lives. These efforts have moved the \nchild support program from 52nd in the Nation to 13th in the Nation.  \n \nThe DWSS has the authority to withhold child support payments from insurance \nsettlements. This authority has existed in Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 31A \nsince 1997. The DWSS currently receives pending bodily injury and workers \ncompensation  claim  data  from  approximately  70  percent  of  the  insurance \ncarriers  through  voluntary  agreements;  however,  the  other  insurers  do  not \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 27, 2019 \nPage 3 \n \nparticipate.  This  leaves  Nevada's  families  without  the  court-ordered  support \nthey are due. To strengthen the efficiency and efficacy of our program, S.B. 33 \nseeks  to  require  insurers  doing  business  in  Nevada  to  provide  the  DWSS \nclaimant  information  prior  to  issuing  a  payment  for  a  tort  liability,  workers \ncompensation or life insurance benefit. Existing State and federal law authorizes \nthe DWSS to attach certain insurance settlements and benefits due to claimants \nwho owe court-ordered child support arrearages.  \n \nThe bill requires insurers to withhold past-due child support from an insurance \npayment upon notification from the child support program that would come in \nthe form a lien. A child support lien gives priority to attorney fees, medical \nexpenses and property damage and it exempts claims made under first party \ncoverage. The lien provides an upfront process for claimants to understand that \ntheir claims may be attached if child support arrears exist. It gets the attention \nof  the  nonpayer  and  it  may  help  encourage  regular  payments.  This  should \nincrease  child  support  collections  for  Nevada's  families,  and  reduce  the \ndependency on public assistance programs. It will improve opportunities for the \nchild support program to compete for federal financial incentives. The State gets \nincentives Nationwide by its performance and can spend them on innovative \nways to improve its child support collection process.  \n \nThe process is fairly simple. Most of the major insurance companies already \nparticipate with child support programs and there are ten states that mandate \nparticipation. Most of those states use what is called the Insurance Services \nOffice (ISO). The ISO provides statistical, actuarial and underwriting services for \nthe insurance industry. The insurance claims are part of that database. The \nDWSS  would  sign  an  agreement  to  see  the  data  that  has  already  been \nsubmitted. The DWSS would do a data-match with the child support side of the \nprogram. If there was a match, the DWSS would look at whether or not it \nwould be eligible to take that money. If eligible, DWSS would send a lien to that \ninsurer and let them know DWSS has some rights to that money. It really is \nseamless.  \n \nThe  DWSS  has  a  proposed  amendment  (Exhibit  C)  making  some  language \nchanges to S.B. 33. We took out the self-insured language. There are very few \nself-insured  groups  in  Nevada  and  we  did  not  want  to  delay  the  bill.  Even \nthough they are exempt, most self-insured companies have come forward and \nasked to voluntarily participate.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 27, 2019 \nPage 4 \n \nThe Nevada Justice Association (NJA) requested some additional changes to \nS.B. 33 that are included in the proposed amendment Exhibit C. I will go over \nthese changes. In section 1 changes \"not less than five days\" to \"within five \ndays\" of opening a claim. The intent of the change was to avoid any potential \ndelay  in  claims  payments.  Additionally,  the  minimum  claim  amount  was \neliminated. The insurer's obligation language was added with the intent to make \nsure the insurance carriers understand that their obligation is met when they \nsubmit their claimant data to the ISO.  \n \nIn  section  2  we  added  NRS  language  to  repeat  existing  statutory  rights \nregarding the right to contest the arrearage for persons affected.  \n \nIn section 3 we added language to notify the claimant's attorney when the \ninsurer first receives a child support lien rather than at the time of settlement. \nThe increased transparency of informing claimants will help prevent settlement \ndelays.  Seriously  injured  claimants  might  need  to  have  their  child  support \nadjusted because they no longer can pay it. This might be an opportunity for the \nattorney to get together with that person and have their child support payments \nadjusted to a new amount. This way they would not have a big arrearage at the \nend of this process. Additionally, the attorney should be notified of any money \nwithheld from a settlement to confirm that all funds are accounted for in the \nprocess. \n \nIn section 4 we added language pointing back to section 1. It reiterates these \nallowable expenses are specific to the provisions in section 1. As of yesterday, I \ndid receive some additional information NJA wants to include in that section. \nWe will work with them.  \n \nIn section 6 we added cleanup language. Originally it was written if an initial \npayment was made, the obligation was fulfilled; however, in some cases there \nis more than one payment. If there are additional payments to follow and you \nreceived  a  child  support  lien  before  the  payments  are  made,  there  is  an \nexpectation  that  you  would  take  that  money  and  pay  the  child  support \narrearage.  \n \nIn section 9 we removed the definition of \"self-insurer\" and all the references.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 27, 2019 \nPage 5 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDo we have any questions? Seeing none, let us open the meeting for those who \nwish to testify in support of S.B. 33. \n \nJEANETTE BELZ (American Property Casualty Insurance Association): \nI am here representing the American Property Casualty Insurance Association. \nWe are in support of S.B. 33.  \n \nJOHN JONES (Nevada District Attorneys Association): \nI am here on behalf of the Nevada District Attorneys Association. We are in \nsupport of S.B. 33. I believe we are close to a good resolution.  \n \nJEFF WITTHUN (Director, Family Support Division, Clark County District Attorney): \nI  am  the  Director  of  the  District  Attorney  Family  Support  Division.  This  is \nsomething we have talked about for at least three years. I support S.B. 33 as it \nwas presented today. I would like to remind the Committee, Clark County has \napproximately 60 percent of the child support caseload. Currently, insurance \ncompanies are self-reporting and insurance collections have raised $1.4 million \nin child support. With mandatory reporting, we feel confident that we may be \nable to double that amount. The purpose of our program is to get child support \ninto the homes of what are mostly low to medium income children and families. \nThis  is  a  tool,  and  this  bill  will  strengthen  this  tool  and  help  us  fulfill  that \nmission.  \n \nANDY MACKAY (Nevada Franchised Auto Dealers Association): \nI am the Executive Director of the Nevada Franchised Auto Dealers Association. \nI wanted to express my support for S.B. 33. \n \nJARON HILDEBRAND (Nevada Trucking Association): \nI am here on behalf of the Nevada Trucking Association. I want to express my \nsupport for S.B. 33.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe have a letter of support (Exhibit D) for S.B. 33 submitted by the American \nProperty Casualty Insurance Association. It is available on the Nevada Electronic \nLegislative Information System (NELIS). Do we have anyone in opposition?  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 27, 2019 \nPage 6 \n \nMARK WENZEL (Nevada Justice Association): \nI am here on behalf of the NJA. We are about 95 percent in support and about \n5 percent opposed. There is one small piece that we are still working on to \nalleviate  concerns  from  some  of  our  members.  The  purpose  of  this  bill  has \n100 percent support. We worry about some unintended consequences that may \ncome up. When we get the last small piece worked out, we will testify in \nsupport.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWhat is this small piece?  \n \nMR. WENZEL: \nIt  has  to  do  with  the  way  the  claims  are  processed  through  worker's \ncompensation. I do not practice specifically in that field, but I know there is \nsome  discrepancy  between  whether  they  do  or  do  not  have  lien  rights  by \nstatute. There needs to be an assurance they will have an ability to represent \npeople who have worker's compensation injuries. We have to make sure those \nclaims  are  still  allowed  to  proceed  forward  in  the  worker's  compensation \ncontext.  It  has  to  do  with  their  costs  and  their  expenses  and  paying  back \nmedical bills in the worker's compensation context as opposed to the general \ntort, wrongful death or property context.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe  are  going  to  close  the  hearing  for  S.B.  33  and  transition  to  our  work \nsession. We will start with Senate Bill 17.  \n \nSENATE  BILL  17:  Makes  various  changes  relating  to  enforcement  of  child \nsupport obligations. (BDR 38-200) \n \nMEGAN COMLOSSY (Policy Analyst): \nSenate Bill 17 was sponsored by this Committee on behalf of the Division of \nWelfare and Supportive Services. It was heard on February 13, 2019. I will read \nthe S.B. 17 work session document (Exhibit E).  \n \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 27, 2019 \nPage 7 \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN MOVED TO DO PASS S.B. 17. \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUMSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI would like to move to the work session for Senate Bill 93. \n \nSENATE BILL 93: Revises provisions relating to the Nevada Commission for \nPersons Who Are Deaf, Hard of Hearing or Speech Impaired. (BDR 38-\n449) \n \nMS. COMLOSSY: \nSenate Bill 93 was sponsored by the Interim Committee on Health Care. It was \nheard by this Committee on February 18, 2019.

We will now hear Senate Bill 194. \n \nSENATE BILL 194: Establishes programs for certain persons of low-income and \npersons in foster care. (BDR 38-780) \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 27, 2019 \nPage 8 \n \nSENATOR PAT SPEARMAN (Senatorial District No.1): \nI am here to present S.B. 194 for your consideration. According to Prosperity \nNow, which is a national think tank, 13 percent of households in Nevada have \nincome  below  the  federal  poverty  level,  which  in  2019,  is  $12,490  for  an \nindividual or $25,750 for a family of 4. While the State has one of the lowest \nrates of households that fall behind on bills, credit and debt are a significant \nproblem. Nearly 1 in 3 consumers with credit card debt borrows more than \n75 percent of his or her total credit card limit, and more than 1 in 4 Nevadans \nhas an account in collections. Less than 1 in 2 consumers, about 45 percent in \nthe State, has prime credit.  \n \nSuch credit and debt issues can lead to other harmful financial decisions, such \nas  relying  too  heavily  on  alternative—often  predatory—financial  products. \nApproximately  one  in  four  Nevada  households  is  considered  “underbanked,” \nwhich  means  despite  having  a  checking  or  savings  account,  they  rely  on \nnonbank alternative financial services like check cashers, payday lenders, or \npawn shops to make ends meet.  \n \nSenate  Bill  194  is  a  great  leap  forward  to  helping  low-income  Nevadans \naccumulate  assets,  become  more  financially  literate,  and  achieve  specific \nfinancial  goals.  This  legislation  seeks  to  bring  hope  and  opportunity  to \nlow-income Nevadans. By creating the Individual Development Account (IDA) \nProgram, qualifying residents will be able to save and grow their money through \nmatching funds to enhance their financial security. The IDA Program will provide \nfor those who need the most help, the opportunity to complete postsecondary \neducation,  start  a  new  business,  buy  a  home,  or  invest  in  various  other \ncategories.  Enhanced  financial  capabilities  will  enable  IDA  participants  to \nimprove  their  overall  financial  well-being,  build  a  foundation  for  continued \neconomic growth, and realize a new level of security to fall back on in difficult \ntimes. \n  \nBefore I walk through the bill, I would like to note that I do have a proposed \namendment (Exhibit G). It is available on NELIS, and I will discuss the changes \nwhen I get to those sections.  \n \nThere are two major pieces in S.B. 194. First and foremost, it establishes the  \nIDA Program. Secondly, it creates the Nevada Statewide Council on Financial \nIndependence.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 27, 2019 \nPage 9 \n \nThe  IDA  Program  is  modeled  after  a  similar  program  in  Oregon  that  allows \nqualifying, low-income residents to establish an IDA to deposit and save money \nto use for certain purposes later on. In Oregon, a fiduciary organization manages \nthe  program  and  provides  matching  funds  to  those  deposited  by  account \nholders. For Nevada, that fiduciary organization will be the Office of the State \nTreasurer (OST).  \n \nThere are various aspects to this bill, so I will walk through the major provisions \nreferring to specific sections. Because of how it is drafted, I will begin with  \nsection 19 and jump around a bit. \n \nSection 19 requires the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to \nestablish  the  IDA  Program,  and  it  authorizes  DHHS  to  select  one  or  more \nfiduciary organizations to administer the money in the Program. \n \nSection 20 outlines the criteria people must meet to qualify for establishing an \nIDA. In order to open an account, a person must be a resident of Nevada, \n12 years  of  age  or  older,  a  tenant  of  certain  housing  projects,  a  Medicaid \nrecipient, and/or a foster care provider who establishes an account for a child in \nhis or her care.  \n \nSubsection  3  of  section  20  requires  the  account  holder  and  a  fiduciary \norganization to enter into an agreement, in which the account holder deposits \nfunds into a financial institution and the fiduciary organization deposits matching \nfunds.  \n \nSubsection 4 of section 20 further requires account holders, with the help of \nthe fiduciary organization, to develop a personal development plan in which they \nspecify the purpose for which the money in their IDA will be used. \n \nSection 21 lists the purposes for which a person can use the funds in an IDA, \nincluding:  acquiring  postsecondary  education  or  job  training,  payment  of  a \nminor’s extracurricular activities, establishment of a small business, purchase or \nrepair of a vehicle, saving for retirement, paying debts, creating or improving a \ncredit  score,  paying  medical  expenses  and  purchase  or  rental  of  and \nimprovement or repair to a primary residence.   \n \nSection 22 requires a fiduciary organization to accept donations from taxpayers \nand to solicit and accept gifts and grants. This money must be used to provide a \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 27, 2019 \nPage 10 \n \nmatch of between $1 and $5 for each $1 deposited by account holders—up to \na total of $3,000 in matching funds in any 12-month period.  \n \nSection 23 outlines the factors DHHS must consider in selecting one or more \nfiduciary organizations to administer the program.  \n \nSection  24  provides  that  the  fiduciary  organization  is  responsible \nfor: administering the IDA accounts, marketing participants, soliciting matching \nfunds, counseling account holders, providing instruction in financial literacy and \nensuring account holder compliance with various requirements. \n \nThese organizations must submit an annual report to DHHS concerning each \nIDA.  \n \nIndividuals who donate matching funds receive a tax credit. Sections 44 and 45 \nof the bill establish a tax credit in an amount approved by the Department of \nTaxation (DOT). The DOT must approve or deny applications for the tax credit \nuntil  the  maximum  amount  of  tax  credit  authorized  for  the  fiscal  year  is \nreached—$5 million in fiscal year 2019–2020. This amount increases each year \nat a rate of 110 percent of the amount authorized for the preceding fiscal year.  \n \nAnother provision defines if a Medicaid recipient deposits money in an IDA, \nsections 2 and 3 prohibit DHHS from considering these funds as income when \ndetermining Medicaid eligibility. These sections also require DHHS to ensure \nfinancial literacy instruction is provided to such individuals. \n \nIf a foster care provider establishes an IDA for a child in their care, section 26 \ndefines the money in the account is the property of the child, and the child shall \nhave access to it upon reaching 18 years of age. As previously noted, I have \nsubmitted an amendment Exhibit G to this section, proposing that such a child \nwho is emancipated can access the money in the account upon emancipation. \nThe purpose is for children who have sought emancipation and been granted it, \nbecause of difficult situations in their home. We want to make sure they have \naccess to these funds so they can start off on a secure financial footing.  \n \nSection 27 of the bill requires the licensing authority to ensure that instruction \nin financial literacy is provided to a foster child for whom an IDA is established, \nand  my  proposed  amendment  extends  this  requirement  to  a  child  who  is \nemancipated.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 27, 2019 \nPage 11 \n \nFor housing project tenants, sections 34 and 36 prohibit housing authorities \nfrom  considering  money  in  the  IDA  to  be  income  during  eligibility \ndeterminations, and sections 35 and 37 require them to ensure that financial \nliteracy instruction is provided to tenants who deposit money in an IDA. In \naddition, section 31 requires the OST to ensure that instruction and training in \nbusiness opportunities are provided to these tenants.  \n \nA complementary, yet a distinct part of the bill, takes us back to sections 5 \nthrough  13,  which  creates  the  Nevada  Statewide  Council  on  Financial \nIndependence  (NSCFI).  The  NSCFI  is  responsible  for:  developing  Statewide \npriorities  and  strategies  for  helping  people  who  receive  public  assistance  or \nsocial  services  to  achieve  financial  independence,  coordinating  with  State \nagencies  that  work  with  these  individuals  toward  increasing  financial \nindependence and overseeing the IDA Program.  \n \nStaff assistance is provided to the NSCFI by DHHS and DHHS must submit an \nannual  report  to  the  Governor,  the  Legislative  Counsel  Bureau  (LCB)  or  the \nLegislative Commission. \n \nFinally, section 46 of the bill authorizes the Board of Regents of the University \nof  Nevada  to  waive  registration  and  laboratory  fees  for  foster  children  or \nchildren in the custody of a child welfare agency, including children sent to an \nout of state mental health facility.  \n \nSection 46 does not require the Board of Regents to waive such fees, but rather \nit authorizes the Board of Regents to do so. This is not a mandate, it simply \nclarifies they do have the authority to do this. Section 46 allows the Board of \nRegents to use its discretion to determine whether or not to waive the fees for \nthese children. Section 46 is similar to other statutes in which legislation has \nauthorized the Board of Regents to waive fees for certain people. For example, \nin NRS 396.5442, the Legislature authorized the Board of Regents to waive \nfees for a child, a widow, or a widower of a person who was killed while \nperforming his or her duties as a member of the Nevada National Guard. Further, \nNRS 396.5445 authorized the Board of Regents to waive fees for a spouse or a \nchild of a person who was identified as a prisoner of war or missing in action \nwhile performing his or her duties as a member of the Armed Forces of the \nUnited  States.  Thus,  section  46  is  similar  to  existing  law  with  respect  to \nauthorizing the Board of Regents to waive fees for certain people. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 27, 2019 \nPage 12 \n \nThis bill seeks to make sure that people who are in poverty or impoverished \nsituations, have a way up and out. The current programs for these individuals \ndo not give them a way out of poverty, but rather are kept in poverty. For \nexample, if you could only have a certain amount in a savings account, how do \nyou ever get to a place where you can pay your rent and other bills, purchase a \nhome, or a small business, or be able to attend college? What is there for foster \ncare kids when they reach the age of 18? This is an opportunity for the foster \ncare parents to establish an IDA account so that upon reaching 18, they have \nsome type of financial security.  \n \nThis  will  be  something  that  will  be  empowering  for  our  citizens  who  are \nstruggling to achieve some level of financial independence. It will also help us to \nbuild on situations and services that are already provided by DHHS and we can \ncapitalize on leveraging some of those programs. Senate Bill 194 is not just \nabout money, it provides financial literacy. It is an opportunity for people to \nlearn how to manage money, how to budget and how to save.  \n \nSTEVE  FISHER  (Administrator,  Division  of  Welfare  and  Supportive  Services, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nThe DHHS is neutral on S.B. 194. The Welfare and Supportive Services (DWSS) \nserves over 736,000 low income individuals in our  program. We administer \nsix programs that support and help lift those individuals out of poverty. Those \nsix programs provide different needs, and together have a positive impact for \nfamilies. For example, a mother with two children, who is working part-time, \nmaking  approximately  $12,000  a  year  would  be  eligible  for  Temporary \nAssistance  for  Needy  Families  (TANF),  which  would  provide  about  $368  a \nmonth. Since she is eligible for TANF, she is also eligible for our employment \nand training programs which provide work support services, vehicle repair, work \nand vocational training. She would also be eligible for childcare, which pays for \nher children to be taken care of while she is working. She would also be eligible \nfor Medicaid, so that she and her children have their healthcare taken care of.  \n \nThe DWSS realized there is a piece missing. We have stabilized the family and \nworked  with  the  mother  to  get  a  better  job.  What  we  have  discovered  is \nfinancial literacy is the missing piece. Continuing with our example, we have \nstabilized the family and now the mother is working full-time, making $24,000 a \nyear. She is no longer eligible for the TANF program, and she is no longer \ngetting employment support services. What happens, in this example, is without  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 27, 2019 \nPage 13 \n \nthe financial literacy education about the importance of savings and warnings \nagainst  the  high  interest  payday  loans,  she  may  not  be  prepared  for  an \nemergency. Her vehicle breaks down, and all of a sudden she needs to make an \nemergency payment and she does not have the money set aside. She goes to a \npayday loan center and gets a high interest loan and all of the sudden things \nstart spiraling out of control and she finds herself back in the TANF program \nagain.  \n \nFinancial literacy is important for the individuals that we serve and this bill does \nthat. It provides financial education for individuals who are low-income that are \neligible for Medicaid. Once you go through the education program and you learn \nhow to save money, you have an opportunity to open an IDA account and start \nsaving. Those savings can be used for fixing and repairing your car. The DWSS \nmanages  the  Medicaid  program  and  participants  who  are  in  the  Medicaid \nprogram,  who  are  age  12  and  older  and  are  eligible  to  participate  in  this \nprogram. The DWSS has over 472,000 Medicaid recipients who are age 12 and \nover and can participate in this program.  \n \nERIK JIMENEZ (Senior Deputy Treasurer, Office of the State Treasurer):  \nWe are excited to see this bill come forward. I would say that throughout the \nCountry, states that have enacted IDA programs have seen a great deal of \nsuccess  and  have  encouraged  more  people  to  start  saving  for  the  future. \nCurrently, the OST operates a similar program called the Achieving a Better Life \nExperience (ABLE) accounts. The ABLE accounts allow people with disabilities \nto save and not lose access to benefits. We see this bill offering those same \nopportunities  to  foster  children,  low-income  families,  and  Medicaid  eligible \npeople. The OST is in support of section 31, which would give us authority to \nprovide instruction and training to tenants of a housing project, operated by \nlocal housing authorities to start their own business. The OST has been working \nthrough the college savings and financial aspects on a navigator model. We \nwould  like  to  use  a  similar  navigator  model  and  encourage  people  in  these \nlow-income housing developments to start a business. We are supportive of \nS.B. 194.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs there anyone here to talk about the tax credits? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 27, 2019 \nPage 14 \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nWhen I talked to the OST, we decided to use the same model as the ABLE \naccount to put together the IDA accounts for S.B. 194. The tax credits and \noperations would be done through the OST.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDoes the ABLE account have a tax credit component? \n \nMR. JIMENEZ: \nIt does not have a tax credit component. The way I read S.B. 194, I do not see \nauthority  for  us  to  offer  a  tax  credit,  but  I  am  willing  to  work  with \nSenator Spearman. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThe  tax  credit  provides  tax  breaks  to  businesses  that  want  to  contribute. \nIndividuals can contribute and grant funding is available. The technical aspects \nwill go through the OST similar to the ABLE account. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nPlease walk me through the tax credit component. A business can contribute \nand in exchange for the contribution, they get a deduction on their modified \nbusiness taxes. How much is that deduction? \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI believe it is up to $5,000 per year. It is $1 for a $5 deduction. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nA business donates $1 and gets a $5 tax break? \n \nMR. JIMENEZ: \nThe way it is written in the bill, it is at least a $1 match up to a $5 match. \nThere is a limit of a $3,000 a year match per IDA. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI just want to make sure I understand this. I am a business and I put $1 in the \naccount and take $5 off the tax bill that I owe?  \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nUp to that amount. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 27, 2019 \nPage 15 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDo we have any other tax credits that are that generous? \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI do not believe that we do. \n \nMR. JIMENEZ: \nThe OST will look into this and get back to you. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI need more information about how the tax credit part works. We will close the \npresentation and are looking for anyone in support of S.B. 194. \n \nCECELIA COLLING (Nevada Women's Lobby): \nI am the Northern Co-Chair for the Nevada Women's Lobby. For a long time, we \nhave been working on policy directives that help people rise out of poverty. One \nof  the  primary  obstacles  is  the  inability  to  understand  and  manage  their \nfinances. We think this is a good way to assist people to learn how to manage \ntheir finances and move out of poverty.  \n \nMARLENE LOCKARD (Nevada Women's Lobby): \nI am here to represent the Nevada Women's Lobby, but I wear another hat, I sit \non the board for the Domestic Violence Resource Center in northern Nevada. \nWe  have  gone  from  a  shelter  presence  to  transitional  housing.  We  have \ntwo transitional housing facilities in northern Nevada. As of last April, we have \ninstituted a mandatory policy that our shelter housing recipients go  through \nfinancial  literacy  training  and  coaching.  We  have  16  transitional  housing \nresidences and among them are 24 children, and each resident has received \ntraining on how to create and monitor monthly budgets, savings for safe and \nsecure housing and learning about how to establish, build and use credit. Over \nthe past 10 months: 5 payday loans have been paid in full; 3 residents have \nchecking  and  savings  accounts  for  the  first  time;  1  client  has  saved  about \n$2,000; 2 residents have purchased cars; 65 percent have increased their credit \nscore and 2 residents have successfully moved out of transitional housing and \nmoved  into  market-rate  apartments  within  the  Reno  area.  These  same  2 \nresidents are off any subsidies including receiving food stamps. We support the \nmodel that Senator Spearman is proposing.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 27, 2019 \nPage 16 \n \nALEX ORTIZ (Clark County): \nWe are proposing an amendment (Exhibit H) that has been accepted by the \nsponsor of S.B. 194. Essentially some of these account holders are in our foster \ncare system. We are proposing to have a representative from our child welfare \nagency  in  Clark  County  be  a  member  of  the  Nevada  Statewide  Council  on \nFinancial  Independence.  Page  2  of  Exhibit  H  proposes  the  specific  changes \nwithin the amendment. It changes the term \"social services\" to \"child welfare \nagency\" in a county whose population is 700,000 or more. These changes \napply only to Clark County.  \n \nBARBARA PAULSEN (Nevadans for the Common Good):  \nNevadans  for  the  Common  Good  (NCG)  has  consistently  advocated  for \nprograms and legislation that provide support to vulnerable populations. I would \nlike to read NCG testimony (Exhibit I) in support of S.B. 194.  \n \nKIMBERLY MULL (Kimberly Mull Advocacy and Consulting): \nI am a victims' rights advocate. I will read my testimony (Exhibit J) in support of \nS.B. 194. \n \nCONNER CAIN (Nevada Bankers Association): \nWe are in support of S.B. 194. We were supportive of S.B. No. 249 of the \n79th Legislative Session. It provided for financial literacy education for Nevada \nstudents. During the Interim, we helped to launch SaverLife Nevada, which is an \nonline savings community. Those who join SaverLife receive weekly savings tips \nfrom a financial coach and matching funds for certain amounts of money saved. \nI mention this program to emphasize the importance of financial literacy to the \nNevada Bankers Association. We believe it can make a difference.  \n \nOn a personal note, I do volunteer work with families that I believe this bill will \nreally help. I particularly like that the money deposited in the IDA would not \nnegatively  impact  some  of  the  support  that  these  families  would  otherwise \nreceive from the State.  \n \nKELLY CROMPTON (City of Las Vegas): \nWe are in support of S.B. 194. We believe this could be a great tool for some of \nthe people that we serve within the homeless corridor. We can point individuals \nin the right direction to get financial literacy. We see a lot of aged-out foster \nchildren and think this could help them.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 27, 2019 \nPage 17 \n \nANDRÉ WADE (State Director, Silver State Equality): \nI am the State Director of Silver State Equality, which is Nevada's Statewide \nlesbian, gay, bi-sexual, transgender, queer or questioning (LGBTQ) Organization. \nWe are here in support of S.B. 194. Our organization has passed over 150 bills \nin California and looks forward to continuing its work in Nevada.  \n \nUnfortunately, LGBTQ youth are disproportionately represented in foster care \nrelated and unrelated to their orientation and gender identity. The American Bar \nAssociation identifies more than 4 to 10 percent of youth in state care identify \nas  LGBTQ.  Often  these  young  people  have  a  difficult  time  with  family \nreunification as part of permanency planning; because their natural parents do \nnot accept their identity. These young people age out of foster care with little to \nno  support.  The  LGBTQ  youth  face  higher  rates  of  homelessness  and  the \nprobability of being trafficked. The creation of a foster youth savings account \nwould  help  provide  a  savings  account  for  foster  youth.  For  some  of  these \nyouths, it would help them obtain their higher education goals with certain fees \nand tuitions waived.  \n \nSUSAN MEUSCHKE (Executive Director, Nevada Coalition to END Domestic and \nSexual Violence): \nI am here in support of S.B. 194. Lack of financial resources is key in trapping \nsomeone into an abusive relationship. Access to resources may provide a way \nout.  According  to  the  National  Network  to  End  Domestic  Violence,  when \nsurvivors  have  stable  access  to  resources  that  help  them  build  economic \nresiliency,  they  and  their  families  are  much  more  likely  to  remain  safe  and \nsecure. The establishment of the IDA, access to financial education and the \nprohibition in considering these assets or income in determining eligibility for \ncritical services are important steps in building financial resiliency. We also see \nthat the creation of the NSCFI will move Nevada forward in developing more \nstrategies to help individuals increase their financial independence.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe have testimony (Exhibit K) in support for S.B. 194 from Jake Wiskerchen, \nDirector of Zephyr Wellness. It is available on NELIS. Is there anyone who would \nlike to testify neutral? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 27, 2019 \nPage 18 \n \nJULIA  PEEK  (Deputy  Director,  Programs,  Department  of  Health  and  Human \nServices  \nWe are neutral on S.B. 194. We will be will be working offline with the DOT \nand the OST to address the questions you asked earlier.  \n \nMICHAEL FLORES (Nevada System of Higher Education):  \nWe are neutral on S.B. 194. During the Interim, Senator Cancela met with the \nChancellor of the Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE). They worked \ntogether to create a tuition and fee waiver for foster care. We had the waiver \npassed by the Board of Regents in September. That waiver allowed anyone in a \nfoster care system by the age of 13, who graduates from a Nevada high school, \nto fill out a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and go to any \nNSHE institution. They would have a mentor once they got there, and have the \nsupport they needed to finish their college education. Our concerns with the bill \nis the eligibility for students. There is a difference between eligibility in the bill \nand the eligibility that the Board of Regents put in policy. We just ask that our \nlegal counsel work with the LCB to clarify that offline.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nFor clarification, Senator Spearman noted that there were three sections in NRS \nwhere NSHE is authorized to grant a waiver of tuition. From what I understand, \nNSHE has no problem with the authorizing language; however, is the eligibility \ncriteria where the difference lies?  \n \nERIC ROBBINS (Committee Counsel): \nThe statutes I am familiar with allow the Board of Regents to grant a waiver of \nregistration fees and laboratory fees for a child, widow or widower of a person \nkilled while performing duties as a member of the National Guard or a child or \nspouse of a member of the Armed Forces who is identified as a prisoner of war \nor missing in action. Those statutes have the exact same eligibility criteria as \nthe one in S.B. 194, which amends NRS 396 and adds subsection 3. \n  \nUnder  section  26  a  person  is  eligible  for  a  waiver  pursuant  to \nsubsection 1 if the person maintains at least a 2.0 grade point \naverage, on a 4.0 grading scale, each semester or the equivalent of \na 2.0 grade point average if a different scale is used.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 27, 2019 \nPage 19 \n \nAlso S.B. 194 amends NRS 396 and adds subsection 4 to section 46.  \n \nA person may use a waiver granted pursuant to this section for 10 \nyears after the person attains the age of 18 years or, if the person \nenrolls in the System before the age of 18 years, for 10 years after \nthe date of such enrollment.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs this the criteria that NSHE is concerned with? Does this criteria match the \ncriteria that was established by the Board of Regents? \n \nMR. FLORES: \nIn our policy, NSHE does not have a GPA requirement, and the 10 years is \ndifferent than our policy. Yes, these are the two areas of concern.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs there any reason why the eligibility criteria for this waiver would need to \nmatch the criteria for the other programs? \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nI  cannot  think  of  one,  since  these  would  be  two  separate  programs.  The \nLegislature  would  be  free  to  establish  whatever  eligibility  criteria  it  felt \nappropriate.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWould it be possible to not put in any eligibility criteria and leave it to the Board \nof Regents to determine what criteria they wanted? \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nYes, the Board of Regents under the constitution would have the freedom to \nestablish eligibility criteria for such a program. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIf we are not specific about the criteria; NSHE could establish the criteria. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI believe there may be some confusion. The amendment proposed by S.B. 194 \nto NRS 396, subsection 1, states, the Board of Regents \"may\" grant a waiver \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 27, 2019 \nPage 20 \n \nof registration fees and laboratory fees. This is why LCB said there is no conflict \nbecause the Board of Regents was not mandated.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI  want  to  make  sure  this  is  clear.  If  we  look  at  S.B.  194  section  46, \nsubsection 1  authorizes  the  Board  of  Regents  to  waive  fees;  however,  the \nsubsections below that require, if they are going to waive those fees, they \nfollow this eligibility criteria. Is that correct? \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nI will check into this. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe have narrowed this down to this issue that needs to be resolved, then we \ncan get NSHE in full support of S.B. 194. Is that right? \n \nMR. FLORES: \nYes,  and  we  plan  to  be  in  support  and  look  forward  to  working  with \nSenator Spearman on this issue. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nTo wrap this up, the OST, the DHHS, the DOT and Senator Spearman are going \nto  get  together  and  talk  about  the  tax  credit  issue.  What  I  am  trying  to \nunderstand, is if I am a business and I donate $1, do I only get a $1 tax credit \nand it does not cost us anything? Or if I donate $1 and I get a $2 tax credit, \nthen it would cost us $1. This is the question I am trying to get answered. I \nsuggest we include LCB Fiscal in this process. They are the experts on tax \ncredits. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI would like to close by saying, we are going to do this now and 20 years from \nnow, there will be people who will benefit from this. We may not know their \nnames.  We  only  know  today  we  are  making  a  valuable  contribution  to  the \ncommunity.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI would like to open the meeting up for public comment. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 27, 2019 \nPage 21 \n \nTOM WELLMAN (Nevada State Education Association-Retired): \nI live in Senate District No. 1. I am President of the Nevada State Education \nAssociation-Retired (NSEAR). I retired from the Clark County School  District \nafter 32 years of employment. I am one of the fortunate school employees that \nhas access to health insurance in my retirement. We have learned that many of \nour members and other public employees have no access to health insurance \nwhen they retire. We have found that members in four of our counties may \nmaintain their current health insurance, but must pay the full premium without \nany assistance or subsidy, which could be anywhere from $800 to $1,000 per \nmonth. This issue must be addressed with other State employees that do not \nhave access to quality affordable health insurance. These outrageous premiums \ntake a significant bite out of their pension checks.  \n \nMany of my peers and colleagues across the State have no access to quality \naffordable healthcare when they retire. They are confronted with the decision to \nretire  or  continue  working  until  they  are  65,  when  they  may  qualify  for \nMedicare.  We  have  learned  the  only  access  some  of  our  members  have  is \nthrough COBRA. After 25, 30 or even 35 years in public education, many have \nto make the hard decision that may impact their health and their quality of life. \nDo they continue to work until they are eligible for Medicare or retire without \nhealth insurance? It just does not seem right and certainly does not seem fair. \nWe are turning to our elected leaders and asking you to find a solution to this \nproblem. Nevada has members that were employed before 1986 that never paid \ninto the Medicare program and will never qualify or have their own access to \nthe program. Yes, they can pay for it, but they do not have access to it. Many \nof our insurance programs will age them out at 65. They then fall into the hole \nthat will leave them with no insurance. We need your help; we want your help; \nwe want to fix these problems. \n \nSTEVEN HORNER (Nevada State Education Association-Retired): \nMy name is Steve Horner, I am the Vice President of the Clark Retired Education \nAssociation and NSEAR.  \n \nTwo of my passions are traveling rural Nevada and playing golf on the courses \nin rural Nevada. During the summer of 2015, while playing in a tournament in \nEly, Nevada, I fell and broke my concentrator. With a breathing disability, at \nclose to 7,000 feet above sea level, the need for oxygen is important. I was not \ntraveling with back-up oxygen, so I needed help. I called the hospital because I \nwas not yet eligible for Medicare I would have to pay full-fare. I could not get \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 27, 2019 \nPage 22 \n \nany oxygen. I am a very lucky person. My wife was able to drive from Las \nVegas to Ely and bring back-up oxygen. However, during that time to keep my \noxygen at safe levels all I had was albuterol and my nebulizer. Thankfully, my \nbreathing disability had not yet progressed to the point of hospitalization. At \nthat point, I realized that we needed some kind of affordable health coverage for \nthose educators and State workers that either had to retire or could retire before \nMedicare eligibility.  \n \nAs this Legislative Session proceeds, we urge you to work with us to find a \nsolution to this important issue. Teachers, educators and other State workers \nhave given their lives to our State. They deserve the best we can give them in \nretirement.

We will open the hearing on \nSenate Bill (S.B.) 60. \n \nSENATE BILL 60: Revises provisions relating to health care. (BDR 40-414) \n \nANDREW SCHULKE (Supervising Senior Deputy Attorney General, Medicaid Fraud \nControl Unit): \nI am here today, with my colleague Linda Anderson, to present S.B. 60 and will \nread  from  my  written  testimony  (Exhibit  C),  and  present  the  proposed \namendments to S.B. 60 (Exhibit D). \n \nCHAIR RATTI:  \nWe see a number of bills moving forward during this Legislative Session to \naddress Community Based Living Arrangements (CBLA). There are others that \nmove CBLA into Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 449. If we see that happen in \nanother vehicle, is this acceptable to you if that does not happen here? \n \nMR. SCHULKE: \nThat is our understanding as well. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI would also like to make clear that your bill suggests specific penalties for \nMedicaid fraud, but not the intent of your bill to have that specifically be the \npenalty, but rather align those penalties with those similar to theft. Therefore, if \nwe  make  changes  to  similar  penalties  for  theft  we  would  be  seeking  an \namendment, is that correct? \n \nMR. SCHULKE: \nThat is correct. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 4, 2019 \nPage 3 \n \nJOHN PIRO (Public Defender, Legislative Liaison, Office of the Clark County Public \nDefender): \nOur  issue  with  S.B.  60  deals  with  section  15  and  those  criminal  penalties \nwithout looking at the potential for things to change. This will raise the penalty \nto  a  Category  B,  punishable  by  1  to  10  years.  We  recognize  the  Attorney \nGeneral's Office has said should any similar criminal justice reform bills pass \nduring the session, they will align their penalties.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs it fair to say if reform moves forward during this Session and reduces the \npenalty for theft, and this bill aligns with that reform, that might change your \nposition? \n \nMR. PIRO: \nYes it would. That would be data-backed criminal justice reform. This is just \nupping penalties in our opinion.  \n \nKENDRA BERTSCHY (Washoe County Public Defender's Office): \nI echo the statements of Mr. Piro. Our objection is regarding sections 15 and 16 \nfor the reasons he stated. It is increasing penalties, as well as information we \nreceived through the data-driven studies. It also indicates the monetary amount \nshould be increased. \n \nJOE HECK (Nevada Osteopathic Medical Association): \nThe  Nevada  Osteopathic  Medical  Association  (NOMA)  fully  supports  the \nCommittee and the Attorney General's efforts to regulate the CBLA and combat \nMedicaid fraud for the provisions outlined in the legislation.  \n \nWe do have concerns with the requirements for fingerprints and background \nchecks as currently proposed in section 14. We do not oppose the need for \nfingerprints and background checks in principle. The vast majority of health care \nproviders in Nevada already undergo fingerprinting and background checks as \nrequired by statute as a condition of professional licensing.  \n \nSenate  Bill  60  does  not  clearly  provide  an  exception  to  what  would  be  a \nduplicative action for those health care providers who have previously submitted \nfingerprints, and undergone a background check by their respective licensing \nboard. Section 14, subsection 1, paragraph (b), subparagraph (2), provides for \nthe submission of a written verification from the provider that fingerprints were \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 4, 2019 \nPage 4 \n \nobtained and directly forwarded to the central repository for the purposes of \ncompleting a background check. It is not clear this includes the fingerprints and \nbackground checks completed by the licensing boards.  \n \nWhile the Attorney General's Office recently submitted amendment changes, \nthe requirement from \"must\" to \"may\" makes me wonder who, as a provider, \nwould  voluntarily  submit  the  fingerprints.  NOMA  respectfully  requests  the \nCommittee  consider  amending  S.B.  60  to  clearly  and  definitively  state  that \nhealth  care  providers,  who  have  submitted  fingerprints  and  undergone \nbackground checks as a condition of professional licensure, are exempt from the \nprovisions of section 14.  \n \nLINDA ANDERSON (Chief Deputy Attorney General, Attorney General's Office): \nThe purpose of the amendment as a \"may\" as he suggested is to allow much \nmore flexibility as to when Medicaid would request background checks. It is not \nthe  intent  to  have  duplication  when  background  checks  have  been  done. \nHowever, in order to ensure reimbursement from Medicaid, background checks \nare often required. The purpose of the amendment to S.B. 60 was to allow \nMedicaid to have the opportunity to perform the background check if there was \nno other background check in place.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWhen the bill was presented, and as I understood the expansion, the focus was \non CBLA and Medicaid fraud. When we talk about the background check being \nexpanded to all provider types, I was thinking all congregate living provider \ntypes. Is the intent to include all provider types that bill Medicaid? \n \nMS. ANDERSON: \nThe purpose of S.B. 60 was to give Medicaid the ability to conduct background \nchecks. The reason for putting \"may\" in place of \"must\" was in the event a \nbackground check had not been done for any other health care provider. We \nagree with Dr. Heck that in most cases health care providers who would be \nseeking  Medicaid  reimbursement  will  already  have  had  a  background  check. \nThere is no intent to create any type of duplication. If an individual had not had \na background check and wanted to seek Medicaid reimbursement, and we see \nan extension in the behavioral health area of more providers wanting to onboard \nto seek Medicaid reimbursement, we wanted to give Medicaid the option of \nproviding background checks. In order to do that they need a statutory authority \nto conduct. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 4, 2019 \nPage 5 \n \nMR. SCHULKE: \nI believe Ms. Anderson has explained the intent behind the background section. \nThis bill gives the ability for Nevada Medicaid to have access to, and screen, the \nrecords of the providers that might not necessarily be covered under NRS449, \nor those not specifically covered by a professional background check. \n  \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWould it be fair to say your intent of the \"may\" is to allow Medicaid, through \nregulatory authority, to decide there may be other categories of providers they \nwould like to add background checks for? \n \nMR. SCHULKE: \nThat  is  correct.  The  \"may\"  would  allow  Medicaid  the  ability  to  get  the \ninformation for the providers not necessarily covered statutorily by NRS 449, \nbut could be Medicaid providers and those providing those services. \n \nCHAIR RATTI:  \nIf Medicaid identified a category of providers they felt should have a background \ncheck, once they put that into the regulatory process, an individual provider \nwould not be able to opt in or out, the \"may\" does not apply to them. \n \nMS. ANDERSON: \nIf that provider wanted to seek Medicaid assistance, yes, they would have to \nhave a background check completed. The \"may\" allows the statutory authority \nfor Medicaid to conduct background checks as the federal government will not \naccept regulation as an authority for seeking a background check. It has to be in \nstatute. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI am going to ask our legal counsel if they feel the way the bill is crafted now is \nmatching the intent, or if there is still work to be done on the amendment. \n \nERIC ROBBINS (Committee Counsel) \nWe would, knowing the intent behind the amendment, more than likely draft it \ndifferently. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe will close the hearing on S.B. 60 and open the hearing on S.B. 222. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 4, 2019 \nPage 6 \n \nSENATE  BILL  222:  Revises  provisions  relating  to  persons  with  disabilities. \n(BDR 38-74) \n \nSENATOR JOSEPH P. HARDY (Senatorial District No. 12): \nSenate Bill 222 had its genesis when I visited one of my high school students \nfrom Moapa Valley, Nevada, who is married and has a family. I realized the \nhearing deficit his children experience was shared congenitally.  \n \nIt became apparent people of limited income will have a difficult time obtaining \nhearing devices to help them in their process. This bill is designed to perhaps \nfocus on the already existing law that is a surcharge for not more than 8 cents \nper month on each access line, for each customer of a local exchange of a \ntelephone company.  \n \nIn as much as children take priority in life, what can be done to grant such a \npriority? Senate Bill 222, section 1 speaks to providing hearing aids for children \nwho are hard of hearing. The remainder of the bill conforms to this priority.  \n \nSection 3, subsection 2, requests the Aging and Disability Services Division to \ndevelop  and  administer  a  program  whereby  any  child  whom  the  Division \ndetermines is hard of hearing, may apply to obtain a hearing aid at no charge if \nthe  child  resides  in  a  home  in  which  the  household  income  is  at  or  below \n205 percent of the federally designated level signifying poverty.  \n \nJared Busker provided a graph showing a family of four at 200 percent federal \npoverty level; you would be making $50,200 a year in order to qualify. I have \nasked the Cox family from Nevada to speak as to the need for S.B. 222 and \nwhy we would like to do something for children with hearing disabilities. \n \nBRADEN COX: \nToday I have with me our son, Case, he is three years old and wears hearing \naids. My wife Lauren and my youngest son Miles are also with me today. I wear \nhearing devices myself and remember as a child my mother talking about how \nexpensive my hearing aids were. I come from a family of nine, so it was a \nchallenge for me to get hearing aids, and they cost my family quite a bit of \nmoney. I later found when my son tested with a significant hearing loss, I had \nthe same concerns my parents had. How are we going to afford hearing aids?  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 4, 2019 \nPage 7 \n \nFortunately, we were able to find the resources to obtain hearing aids for our \nson. Once we were able to accomplish this, it significantly improved his ability \nto hear us, benefiting his safety, learning and various other things. I have to \nwork, so fortunately my wife is able to stay at home with the children. Given \nCase's health issues and various needs, she has been tenacious about meeting \nwith different people and making the connections possible to get him the help \nhe needs.  \n \nI have met and had conversations with other families who are not as lucky. \nThey do not have the same connections, the same resources available to them. \nUltimately,  what  we  have  found  is  there  is  a  significant  gap  between  the \nresponsibility of a government being able to help their citizens and families, and \nreceiving that help when it comes to the youngest members of Nevada. I was \nborn  here,  am  raising  my  family  here,  and  it  was  frustrating  moving  from \nColorado to Nevada in order to take care of my family and seeing this gap.  \n \nI  am  grateful  to  reconnect  with  Senator  Hardy  and  grateful  for  his  efforts \npresenting this bill to correct the issue. This bill will help children obtain hearing \naids  ensuring  there  is  more  access  to community  programs  which  can  help \nthese families. My wife found the assistance and guidance we received from the \nDeaf Centers of Nevada. Having had conversations with the previous director of \nthat organization, I found there was a lot of difficulty in permanently obtaining \nfunding for help. It is one thing giving children hearing aids; it is another to \nallow an organization to have the tools to grant language and teach parents and \nsiblings American Sign Language (ASL).  \n \nIt has been exceptionally challenging for us to juggle the responsibilities of being \nparents, along with learning a new language in order to communicate with our \nson. Trying to be the best parents we can requires us to constantly learn new \nthings. We found we were on the bottom of a waiting list of 80 people looking \nfor  assistance.  Fortunately,  because  of  my  wife's  ability  to  make  the \nconnections she did, we were able to cut in line and get services through the \nDeaf Centers of Nevada. We know there are those who are still waiting, and it \nhas been heartbreaking to see other families struggle through that. We know \nthis bill can help rectify that.  \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nYour wife explained to me, when I was fortunate to have met her, that before \nCase is 10 years old he will lose most of his hearing, is that correct? \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 4, 2019 \nPage 8 \n \nLAUREN COX: \nThat is correct. The hearing loss he has is genetic and progressive. From our \nexperience  with  the  genetic  side,  it  does  change  with  each  member  of  the \nfamily. As far as we can tell, in Case's situation his hearing loss is worse than \nhis father's loss was at his age. He is losing his hearing a little faster than his \nfather.  \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nWithout this legislation or similar legislation, what might be the outcome for \nyour family? \n \nMS. COX: \nBecause of the wonderful help we have received from the Deaf Centers of \nNevada, we have been able to learn ASL in order to communicate with Case \nand others in the deaf community. Without the Deaf Centers of Nevada we \nwould be on our own to learn about the deaf community, which is a whole new \ngame for us. It is not easy to pay for extra schooling in order to learn these new \nthings, which is why the Deaf Centers of Nevada is so valuable for our family. It \nis important for them to have the funding they need so they can continue to be \na support for families such as ours.  \n \nMR. COX: \nIt is one thing to provide hearing aids for children and assistance to the families; \nit is another to put them on the path to successful communication, whatever \nthose needs may be. I believe S.B. 222 will greatly expand the ability of the \nState to help our youngest members, to give them every opportunity they can \nto succeed. I was fortunate to receive the help I did when I was young, and I \nhope to be as successful as my parents were to provide the best for my son. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nYou have identified a funding source in this bill. As is with all funding sources, \nthis one is paying for other things at this time. What is it currently paying for; \nare we giving up anything else to get this support? \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe fiscal note is $8 million for a biennium. I do not know how much of that is \navailable, or not available, for other things. I would defer to the fiscal group to \nanswer that question.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 4, 2019 \nPage 9 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSection 3, subsection 2, states the Division shall establish by regulation the \nmanner in which a person may apply to receive a hearing aid, and applications \nmust be approved to the extent money is available in the order in which the \napplications are received. It appears the direction the Division has given is each \nyear they will set an amount. There will be the line of folks who apply and we \nwill award service until the money is gone, and others will wait until the next \nyear to apply. Is the $8 million what it would cost to fund everyone in that \nincome range? \n \nRIQUE ROBB (Deputy Administrator, Aging and Disability Services): \nBased on the fiscal note for how the current bill is written, this is for birth to \n18 years of age and would be within the Telecommunication Device for the \nDeaf (TDD) surcharge, which is where we were directed to review. Depending \non funding, because there is a cap of 8 cents, this is where the limitations could \npotentially come; we are currently at 6 cents. The challenge with the budgeting \npiece on the TDD surcharge is that we are always two years in arrears. We are \nwaiting for the 2019 budget from our February 1st submission. The funding, if \nutilized through the TDD surcharge, is based on the availability of funds. \n \nCHAIR RATTI:  \nMy understanding is that if you qualify for Medicaid, you have a hearing aid \ncovered. The 205 percent poverty limit on this bill is taking that next level \nabove qualifying for Medicaid up to 205 percent, costing $8 million to cover the \ngap from birth to 18 years of age. \n \nMS. ROBB:  \nYes, that is correct. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThis does not mean we will jump right to $8 million. As it is written, each year \nyou would work to establish the numbers. Who is on the Telecommunications \nCommittee, how do they set their funding and how is it allocated? \n \nMS. ROBB:  \nWith the 8 cent cap, our budget is submitted to the Deaf Centers of Nevada, or \na grantee of a similar sort, to provide those deaf and hard of hearing services it \nsubmitted to the Public Utilities Commission (PUC). The PUC sets the rate based \non the budget requested for all services. We have the relay contract directed by \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 4, 2019 \nPage 10 \n \nNRS 427A. That is how the amount is determined. We are currently at 6 cents. \nWe have not received confirmation from the PUC to determine whether it will be \nup to 7 cents, or remain at 6 cents for this year's budget. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nRight now you are using 6 cents and you have put in a budget for all of the \nqualifying services for the following year. They will come back with whether \nthey will stay with 6 cents or bump it up to 7 cents. If you add this into the \nnext year's planning process, they could come back and say that will take us to \n8 cents and still may not be able to meet the entire need. Is the 8 cent cap set \nin statute? \n \nMS. ROBB: \nYes that is all correct. The 8 cent cap is set in NRS 427A. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nWe have heard there are other bills proposed to pay for the Executive Director \nposition for the Commission for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing. How would those \ntwo bills either interact or impact each other? \n \nMS. ROBB: \nThey would be competing for the same funding based on how both bills are \ncurrently written. \n \nJARED BUSKER (Children's Advocacy Alliance): \nDuring the interim we worked with advocates and families to look at the high \ncost of hearing devices and the financial burden these devices place on those \nfamilies.  The  Children's  Advocacy  Alliance  has  proposed  two  conceptually \nfriendly  amendments  (Exhibit  E)  to  S.B.  222.  I  have  a  handout  (Exhibit  F) \noutlining the reasoning behind the amendments. \n \nPENNI ECHOLS: \nI am here in support of S.B. 222. My daughter is four years old and she is deaf \nand  blind.  She  benefits  from  the  use  of  hearing  aids.  She  receives  Nevada \nMedicaid as a participant in the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act income \nwaiver  program  (TEFRA)/Katie  Beckett  as  she  has  additional  medical  needs \nbeyond her vision impairment and hearing disability. This bill could potentially \nopen access to another handful of families to make use of hearing aids for their \nchildren, including steps for language acquisition. Not all children benefit solely \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 4, 2019 \nPage 11 \n \nfrom the use of hearing aids; alone they do not provide equal access to spoken \nEnglish.  My  daughter  requires  American  Sign  Language  to  understand  what \nhappens around her. This legislative term has huge potential to change the lives \nof the deaf and hard of hearing individuals in Nevada.  \n \nMIKE EIFERT (Executive Director, Nevada Telecommunications Association): \nThe Nevada Telecommunications Association (NTA) rises in the neutral position \nas its members do not oppose hearing aids for children of low-income families. \nThe NTA does oppose diversion of the TDD funds for purposes the funds were \nnot established to support. The NTA believes legislative intent is unequivocally \nclear that any funding generated by the TDD surcharge can only be used for \ntelecommunications equipment and related services. This position is supported, \ngiven the requirement to fund the TDD which appears within the sole statute \nunder  the  subheading  entitled  Program  to  Provide  Devices  for \nTelecommunications to Persons with Impaired Speech and Hearing. It appears \nNevada has turned to telecommunication surcharges to fund things that divert \nthe funds.  \n \nLast Session we dealt with a diversion of 911 surcharges that now has us on a \nlist of six states the Federal Communications Commission is monitoring to divert \n911 surcharges for things they were not intended to do. This Session we have \ntwo new bills that are asking for more money from the 911 surcharge. Diverting \nfunds for any other reason is simply bad policy, lacks transparency, undermines \npublic competence in elected officials and was not the legislative intent when \nthe Nevada Legislature codified the TDD program in 1985.  \n \nI would also like to clarify items mentioned earlier. Last Friday, the PUC ruled on \nthe TDD surcharge  for State Fiscal Year 2020.  They kept the surcharge at \n6 cents.  \n \nI heard discussion about the cap and what can be done inside the cap. Clearly, \nif this was not capped, we would be looking at a significant tax increase. If I \nwere to apply the revenues generated by one cent to the $8,123,000, we are \ntalking  about  an  additional  20  cent  TDD  surcharge.  I  am  unsure  if  the \n$8,123,000  was  derived  using  the  205  percent  above  the  poverty  level;  I \nsuspect it was. If we apply the 400 percent above the poverty level, I also \nsuspect the $8,123,000 will go up significantly. If we are looking at a tax \nincrease, I believe this bill should be looked at as requiring a two-thirds majority \nto pass in both houses. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 4, 2019 \nPage 12 \n \nThe Commission for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing is dedicated to working for \nthe deaf community. It is comprised of the deaf, and they are working on a \nstrategic plan that has been developed by the deaf. That plan lays out the goals \nand  aspirations  of  the  deaf  over  the  next  five  years,  and  then  will  be \nperpetuated.  Hearing  aids  are  needed  for  children;  there  are  lots  of  things \nneeded for the deaf community. At this moment, the priorities set for the deaf \ncommunity do not include hearing aids for children. It is in the five year program \nunder advocacy for policy change in 2021. I only mention this, as to the best of \nmy knowledge, the Commission for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing was unaware \nthis bill was going to be brought forward. It is only respectful, that if we wish to \nmake changes for the deaf, we come to the Commission that was established \nfor  Nevada  and  let  them  know  what  we  would  like  to  do  with  their  TDD \nsurcharges. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWhat is the value of one cent of TTD money? \n \nMR. EIFERT: \nThat  fluctuates.  My  understanding  is  the  PUC  typically  looks  at  between \n$420,000 and $430,000 per cent. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nOne cent is less than $500,000? \n \nMr. Eifert: \nYes, that is correct. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAre you aware currently of the 6 cents we are collecting, and the way the \nfunding  is  awarded  in  the  plan  referenced  by  an  earlier  speaker?  Is  there \nanything  we  are  currently  doing  that  is  beyond  the  limited  scope  you  are \nsupporting, the telecommunication specific assistance? \n \nMR. EIFERT: \nWe had this discussion in  2015. At that time there was discussion around \nexpanding the program in the deaf centers. A number of court actions were \ntaking place and actually went to the Supreme Court. At that time the Supreme \nCourt saw deaf centers could use funds for what they deemed necessary for \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 4, 2019 \nPage 13 \n \nthe deaf. The industry entered into negotiations with the Legislature, in good \nfaith, and this is where the 8 cent cap was instituted.  \n \nTo the best of my knowledge, the previous speaker described the expenditures \nfairly well. There are centers in Las Vegas and in Reno providing an invaluable \nservice to the deaf. They are the focal point for the deaf in this State. The relay \nservice, an operator intercepted call, goes without saying, and are fully funded \nunder that 6 cents. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI want to be clear of your opposition. I heard you state your association is \nagainst  TDD  funds  being  used  for  anything  outside  of  telecommunications \nassistance.  Then  I  heard  you  say  in  the  negotiations  that  followed  the \n2015 legislation, you agreed as long as it stayed capped at 8 cents, use it for \nwhatever you want.  \n \nMR. EIFERT: \nWe are comfortable with the negotiated 8 cent cap and the centers use that \nmoney. We are not in opposition to the use of the 8 cents as it is being used \ntoday.

I will turn control of the \nmeeting to Vice Chair Spearman. \n \nSENATE BILL 235: Revises provisions relating to health insurance coverage. \n(BDR 57-734) \n \nSENATOR JULIA RATTI (Senatorial District No. 13): \nThis  bill  is  important  to  me  personally,  and  I  know  it  is  important  to  the \nconstituents who I serve. With the state of affairs at the national level, people \nare particularly concerned about their access to health care, especially if they \nhave a pre-existing condition. People are worried about being able to continue to \naccess the care they need to maintain their health and, in some cases, survive.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 6, 2019 \nPage 3 \n \nWhat S.B. 235 does is take the provision in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that \nprohibits  discrimination  based  on  health  status  and  puts  this  provision  into \nNevada  law.  Put  simply,  if  you  have  a  pre-existing  condition,  an  insurance \nprovider  cannot  discriminate  against  you,  charge  you  a  higher  rate  or  not \nprovide coverage at all, based on that health status. Many of us were here at a \ntime  before  the  ACA,  where  this  was  not  the  case.  If  we  should  lose  the \ncoverage that we currently have at the national level in Nevada, we should not \ndiscriminate against anyone based on their health status.  \n \nVIVIAN LEAL (Volunteer Advocate, Multiple Sclerosis Society): \nMy name is Vivian Leal. I am a patient with multiple sclerosis (MS) for 20 years. \nI am also a Volunteer Advocate for the Multiple Sclerosis Society and the Lead \nfor the Indivisibles Health Care Issue Team. This bill extends protections to \npatients with pre-existing conditions. Since we have the law in place at the \nfederal level, why do we need this bill? I will read my testimony (Exhibit C) \nwhich explains why we need S.B. 235.  \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nI want to add to her testimony with my own personal story. When I was in my \nlate  twenties,  I  was  the  Executive  Director  of  a  small  nonprofit  for  a  gang \nprevention and intervention program. I was working with kids in a leadership \nposition and it was a good time in my life. Unfortunately, at that time I was \ndiagnosed with cancerous tumors on my vocal cords. It lead to 9 surgeries and \n17 years of treatment to periodically remove the tumors. We could never get all \nthe cancer and I was never able to get to a period where I was in remission for \nmultiple years. Typically, the tumors came back every two years. Fortunately, it \nwas a minor outpatient surgery, but seven or eight surgeries later, you could see \nthat I may not be the ideal candidate for an insurance policy.  \n \nThis  was  before  ACA.  I  was  fortunate  not  because  I  had  a  spouse  with  a \nreliable job with insurance. I love my husband, but he is a musician and sound \nengineer, and that does not necessarily lend itself to strong insurance coverage. \nWhat  I  had  was  a  board  member,  who  worked  for  the  nonprofit  and  also \nworked in the insurance industry. When I decided to leave the gang alternative \npartnership and start my own business as a consultant to other nonprofits, he \npulled me aside and said, \"Do not ever let your coverage lapse. If you do, there \nis a good chance you will no longer be insurable\". With that serious warning in \nmind, my husband and I dug deep and purchased what is known as a Health \nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act, guaranteed policy. This was an \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 6, 2019 \nPage 4 \n \nacknowledgement that I had a pre-existing condition and I could get coverage, \nbut  I  would  pay  significantly  more  for  that  coverage.  At  that  time  as  an \nExecutive  Director  I  was  making  $28,000  a  year,  and  maybe  I  got  up  to \n$32,000, but I believe the policy cost me $1,200 a month. My husband, who \nwas healthy, paid for a catastrophic policy at a much lower rate. If that board \nmember had not pulled me aside at a time when I thought I was invincible, I \nwould probably have been one of those folks without insurance.  \n \nWe  do  not  want  to  go  back  to  that  time.  This  bill  just  ensures  that  the \nprotections that are currently in the ACA are extended to all Nevadans, even if \nwe lose those protections at the federal level.  \n \nERIC ROBBINS (Committee Counsel):  \nFor those not familiar with how Title 57 of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) is \nlaid out, there are separate chapters for each type of health insurance. For \nexample,  individual,  market,  group,  each  have  their  own  chapter.  There  are \nseveral sections of this bill that do essentially the same thing for each type of \nhealth insurance. Those are sections 1, 6, 9, 13, 14, 18, 23 and 24.  \n \nI will begin by discussing what the bill as drafted does, then I will go into the \namendments. Those sections require an insurer to offer and issue a health plan \nregardless of the health status of any person or any dependent of the person. \nThey prohibit insurers from denying, limiting or excluding a benefit based on \nhealth status, or requiring an insured to pay a higher premium, deductible, copay \nor coinsurance, based on health status or genetic information. To sum this up, \nthis bill prevents discrimination based on health status in three different areas: \nthe issuance of a plan, the benefits offered under a plan and the cost associated \nwith the plan.  \n \nI will go over the first proposed amendment (Exhibit D), which was submitted \nby Senator Ratti. This amendment does two things. The bill as drafted discusses \nthe different type of policies using the respective terms used in those chapters. \nThis amendment takes those respective terms out and replaces them with the \nterm \"health benefit plan\" to ensure uniformity of applicability across insurance \ntypes. The amendment defines the term \"health benefit plan\" in each of those \nchapters in the same manner as defined in NRS 687B.470. What this definition \ndoes is exclude all benefit types that are not subject to the requirements of the \nACA concerning pre-existing conditions.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 6, 2019 \nPage 5 \n \nThe second thing the amendment does is add subsection 4 to all the sections \nthat deal with group plans. What subsection 4 does is authorize group health \nplans  to  maintain  wellness  programs  under  the  same  conditions  as  such \nprograms are authorized under the ACA. Subsection 4 will not be added to \nsection  1  of  the  bill,  which  deals  with  individual  plans,  because  wellness \nprograms based on health status are not currently permitted under the ACA \nregulations for individual plans.  \n \nThere is an amendment from the Nevada Association of Health Plans (Exhibit E) \nthat would clarify that group health plans are issued to groups, not individuals. \nJust to note, NRS 0.039 defines the term \"person\", which is currently used in \nthose chapters to refer to individual people and any nongovernmental entity. \nThis change would be for clarification and not be a substantive change.  \n \nThe rest of S.B. 235 maintains conforming type changes. In sections 3-5, 7, \n10-12, 15-17, 20, 21 and 29, it removes partially duplicative or unnecessary \nprovisions  from  existing  law.  Sections  2  and  22  make  other  conforming \nchanges. In section 19, it makes this section applicable to Medicaid Managed \nCare  plans.  In  sections  25  and  26,  it  makes  those  changes  applicable  to \ninsurance plans provided by local government employers for their employees \nand also to the Public Employee Benefits Program, which provides coverage for \nState employees. Local governments can enter into a contract to have their \nemployees covered by this as well. Sections 8 and 22 make other changes to \nensure  the  applicability  to  all  intended  plans  for  which  the  ACA  currently \nprovides these protections. In section 27, it removes a provision of existing law \nthat allows a grandfathered group plan under the ACA to exclude claims for \ncertain pre-existing conditions. This is because grandfathered group plans are \nnow subject to all provisions of the ACA concerning pre-existing conditions. \nThis just conforms to federal changes.  \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nAll of these amendments are the result of meetings with stakeholders over the \npast several weeks to ensure that this bill conforms to, does no more than, but \nonly does what is in the ACA.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe federal government is participating in the cost of the ACA, what is the \nState's share now with the ACA and what will it be if the ACA goes away?  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 6, 2019 \nPage 6 \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nI want to make clear this is not a mandate to have a certain level of benefits. \nThis is not about adding benefits; the essential benefits do not change. All this \nstates is that you cannot discriminate against a person who is participating in a \nhealth plan based on their health status. I would make an argument this bill does \nnot add any significant cost to Nevada.  \n \nThe true cost to Nevada from the ACA came when we decided as a State to \nexpand coverage to a population. If we were to lose the ACA, we would need \nto react quickly, because the budget implications of losing the federal match \ndollars  that  allowed  us  to  expand  that  population  would  be  significant. \nCurrently, there is a scaling down of the federal match dollars. It started as \n100 percent and the percentage declines each year and what the State needs to \ncontribute grows a little each year. There is no direct relationship between that \nand what is proposed in this bill.  \n \nSENATOR WOODHOUSE: \nWe can take that issue to our fiscal staff to make sure there are no costs.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI heard S.B. 235 would allow every Nevadan to have coverage. Is that true?  \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nNo, that is not true. This bill protects against discrimination based on a pre-\nexisting condition. You cannot be denied coverage and your coverage cannot be \nmore expensive because of your health status. This does not open up coverage \nfor another class of beneficiaries; it does not add insurance for anyone who is \nnot  currently  covered.  If  you  have  a  pre-existing  condition,  you  cannot  be \ndiscriminated against in terms of being offered coverage or how expensive that \ncoverage will be.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nDoes that apply to group plans and individual plans? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nIt applies to everything to which the ACA applies. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 6, 2019 \nPage 7 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nDo we know what we are paying for the Medicaid expansion? What is the cost \nif the ACA goes away? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThis bill does not deal with the Medicaid expansion. That is one of the many \naspects of the ACA. Another aspect of the ACA is protections for people who \nhave pre-existing conditions. This bill does not touch any other aspect of the \nACA other than pre-existing conditions. We know that if the ACA was to go \naway, if this bill was in place, the folks who have a pre-existing condition would \nnot be affected.  \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nWe will ask for anyone to testify in support of S.B. 235. \n \nBARRY GOLD (AARP Nevada): \nI am the Director of Government Affairs for AARP Nevada. AARP is all about \naccess  to  quality  affordable  health  care.  I  forget  the  exact  statistic,  but \napproximately 50 percent of people over 50 years of age have a pre-existing \ncondition. If people cannot get insurance then they do not have access to health \ncare. If the health care does not cover what they need, then it is not quality and \nif providers can charge people more because they have a pre-existing condition \nthen it certainly is not affordable. On behalf of our 348,000 members across the \nState, we support this bill. \n \nTOM CLARK (Nevada Association of Health Plans): \nWe support S.B. 235 and look forward to working with Sentor Ratti as we \nresolve a few minor issues within this bill. \n \nBROOKE MAYLATH (Transgender Allies Group): \nI think it is important to look at who defines the term, pre-existing conditions. I \nwill give you a specific example as it relates to the transgender community. \nApproximately ten years ago there was a transgender woman who paid for her \nown  surgery  and  had  support  from  her  company  and  co-workers.  She  was \nplaying on the company's softball team in the women's league when she slid \ninto second base and broke her leg. She submitted a claim to her insurance \ncompany. The insurance company replied: \nYou  have  a  pre-existing  condition.  If  you  had  not  transitioned \nbecause  of  your  gender  dysphoria,  you  would  have  not  been \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 6, 2019 \nPage 8 \n \nplaying on the women's softball team, and you would not have slid \ninto  second  base  and  you  would  not  have  broken  your  leg. \nTherefore, your broken leg is not covered because it is the result of \na pre-existing condition.  \n \nThese  are  the  kinds  of  things  we  need  to  make  sure  do  not  happen  to \nNevadans. I would like to draw your attention to the number one pre-existing \ncondition used in the past to deny coverage, and that is pregnancy.  \n \nCATHERINE O'MARA (Nevada State Medical Association): \nWe support this bill. I want to share some information with the Committee. \nCurrently  27  percent  of  adults  ages  18–64  have  some  kind  of  pre-existing \ncondition. Before the ACA, they would likely be declined coverage. In Nevada \nthat number is 25 percent. The three main areas where coverage is denied is \npregnancy,  mental  health  and  substance  abuse.  However,  a  Kaiser  Family \nFoundation  Study  from  2015  looked  at  the  medical  underwriting  in  the \nindividual market prior to the ACA. It looked at the list of the most common \ndeclinable conditions: HIV\\AIDS, heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's, dementia, \nepilepsy, diabetes, hemophilia, hepatitis C, kidney disease, lupus, MS, obesity, \norgan transplant, Parkinson disease, and pending surgery or hospitalization. We \nare talking about a lot of conditions used to deny coverage. This impacts not \njust patient care, but continuity of care. For example, even if a treatment had \nbegun,  that  treatment  would  not  be  covered  if  a  person  changed  jobs  or \nobtained different insurance. This bill is important for Nevada patients. \n \nJOY VISELLI: \nI am speaking for my daughter and granddaughter (Exhibit F) written testimony \nin support of S.B. 235.  \n \nCHELSEA CAPURRO (Health Services Coalition): \nI am here on behalf of the Health Services Coalition. We are in support of this \nbill. \n \nAMANDA KHAN (Programs Director, Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada): \nI am the Programs Director of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada. As \nmany as one in every two people in this Country have had at least one pre-\nexisting medical condition. Many more will develop such conditions over the \ncourse of their lives. Supporting S.B. 235 means that no matter what happens \nat the federal level, no Nevadan will have to worry about being discriminated \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 6, 2019 \nPage 9 \n \nagainst because of health status. I take this issue personally, because I suffer \nfrom asthma, which is a pre-existing condition.  \n \nHEIDI PARKER (Executive Director, Immunize Nevada): \nWe are in support of S.B. 235, as there is a clear connection between health \ncoverage and being able to access life-saving vaccines. The current coverage \nunder the ACA recommends vaccines be covered with no copayments or cost \nsharing when provided by in-network providers in group and individual plans. \nThis has contributed to increased access to vaccines across Nevada. Insurance \ncoverage without barriers, such as restrictions on pre-existing conditions, is vital \nto keeping our communities protected from vaccine preventable diseases.  \n \nWILL PREGMAN (Battle Born Progress): \nWe are in support of S.B. 235. This is an essential bill to protect pre-existing \nconditions  and  prevent  discrimination  against  the  25  percent  of  the  folks \nmentioned  in  the  Kaiser  Family  Foundation  Study  who  have  a  pre-existing \ncondition  in  Nevada.  These  Nevadans  face  an  existential  risk  should  the \nTexas v. United States case fail its appeal and the ACA is struck down. Those \npre-existing conditions mentioned before are life or death scenarios and need to \nbe covered. In the current environment, there has been federal sabotage of the \nACA that makes those with pre-existing conditions vulnerable, particularly when \none  gets  suckered  into  short-term  junk  insurance  plans  that  do  not  cover \nessential conditions.  \n \nMICHAEL HILLERBY (Hometown Health): \nI am here on behalf of Hometown Health in support of S.B. 235. We also \nsupport the continuance of the wellness discounts.  \n \nMAYA HOLMES (Healthcare Research Manager, Culinary Health Fund): \nWe represent approximately 130,000 lives. We support S.B. 235.  \n \nLISA CADY:   \nMy  name  is  Lisa  Cady  and  I  am  reading  testimony  (Exhibit  G)  for  Lysa \nBuonanno, who could not be here because of health conditions.  \n \nTODD INGALSBEE (Professional Fire Fighters of Nevada): \nWe are here in support of S.B. 235. We had one outstanding issue as it relates \nto our retiree plans. Currently, our retiree plans are not subject to ACA and we \nare going to continue to work with Senator Ratti. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 6, 2019 \nPage 10 \n \nSHANE PICCININI (Food Bank of Northern Nevada): \nAccess to health care and the cost of health care are the single biggest threats \nto food security that our clients face. For this reason, we support S.B. 235. \n \nMARLENE  LOCKARD  (Retired  Public  Employees  of  Nevada;  Nevada  Women's \nLobby): \nI am here representing the Retired Public Employees of Nevada and the Nevada \nWomen's Lobby. Both entities support S.B. 235.  \n \nMICHAEL  HACKETT  (Nevada  Primary  Care  Association;  Nevada  Public  Health \nAssociation): \nI am here representing the Nevada Primary Care Association and the Nevada \nPublic Health Association. Both organizations are in support of S.B. 235.  \n \nELISA CAFFERATA (Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada): \nWe support S.B. 235 in the interest of public health benefits.  \n \nCAROLINE MELLO ROBERSON (State Director, NARAL Pro-Choice Nevada): \nI am the  State Director of NARAL Pro-Choice Nevada. I am here to testify \n(Exhibit H) in support of S.B. 235. I would like to note that before the ACA, \npregnancy was considered a pre-existing condition that would have prevented \nany expectant parent, male or female, from obtaining coverage in all but five \nstates.  Many  individual  health  insurance  carriers  considered  a  previous \ncaesarean section to be a reason to deny an application. We are glad those days \nare  over  and  this  legislation  is  part  of  protecting  a  right  that  all  Nevadans \ndeserve.  \n \nJARED BUSKER (Children's Advocacy Alliance): \nThe  Children's  Advocacy  Alliance  facilitates  Nevadans  Together  for  Health \nAccess, which is comprised of healthcare advocates working to increase access \nto  quality  health  care  for  the  benefit  of  all  Nevadans  by  protecting  and \nsupporting crucial elements of the ACA. This bill has been identified as one of \ntheir top priorities. \n \nLAURA HALE (Indivisible Northern Nevada): \nI  am  one  of  1,595  members  of  Indivisibles  Northern  Nevada  (Exhibit  I)  in \nsupport of S.B. 235. I have yet to see a survey that said people were not \nconcerned about coverage for pre-existing conditions. It seems like every year \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 6, 2019 \nPage 11 \n \nsince the ACA was introduced those numbers go up and more people want this \ncoverage.  \n \nMIKE RAMIREZ (Las Vegas Police Protective Association): \nI am here representing the Las Vegas Police Protective Association and I am \nalso a member of the Nevada Law Enforcement Coalition which has 10,000 \nmembers. We are here to support S.B. 235. \n \nHEIDI ENGLUND (Activist, National Multiple Sclerosis Society): \nI am an MS activist and a retired State of Nevada employee; medically retired \ndue to MS. I am here to testify (Exhibit J) in support of S.B. 235. \n  \nROBIN REEDY (Executive Director, National Alliance on Mental Illness): \nI am the Executive Director for the National Alliance on Mental Illness here in \nNevada. I think it is important to note that 50 percent of all chronic, serious \nmental health conditions begin by the age of 14 and 75 percent by the age of \n24. If we lose our pre-existing conditions it will be devastating for those people \nand their families. I am in support of S.B. 235 and I hope that a parity bill can \nfollow.  \n \nCHRISTINE NOELLERT (Group Leader, Reno Multiple Sclerosis Indivisibles): \nMy name is Christine Noellert and I have had MS for 16 years. I am the founder \nand have managed the Reno MS Indivisibles support group for the past seven \nyears (Exhibit K). I am here to support S.B. 235.  \n \nGWEN HUNTER: \nI want to share my experience working next to someone who is going through \ncancer treatment. I worked with Karen at the county. Soon after she started \nworking,  she  was  diagnosed  with  breast  cancer.  She  went  through  her \ntreatment while working, taking sick leave to get treatments and coming back \nto work so she would not lose her job and her insurance. To go through the \nthreat of not being able to have insurance cover her condition, if she had to get \ncoverage someplace else, is not okay. I support S.B. 235.  \n \nJOELLE GUTMAN (Washoe County Health District): \nI am here on behalf of the Washoe County Health District. Access to health care \nis  an  important  social  determinant,  and  it  affects  quality  of  life  and  life \nexpectancy. We support S.B. 235. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 6, 2019 \nPage 12 \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMEN: \nDo you have any closing remarks? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nI want to emphasize this bill is very narrow in scope. It does one important \nthing;  it  makes  sure  we  do  not  discriminate  against  people  who  have  a \npre-existing condition when offering them coverage or pricing that coverage. My \nsincere hope is that we protect the ACA and we protect all the elements that \ncome from the ACA, and that we improve it and make sure the other issues \nbrought up here today get addressed. At a minimum, if we lose the ACA, we \ncannot go back to a place where having a pre-existing condition means that you \ncan no longer access health care. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWhy do some subsections say \"shall offer\" and other subsections say \"that \noffers\"? \n \nMR. ROBBINS:  \nThe first subsection requires the insurer to offer and issue the plan regardless of \nhealth status. Any insurer that is required by the ACA to issue a health plan is \nalso required by the bill to issue a plan regardless of health status.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nDo all of those chapters deal with the insurer, who is already covered under the \nACA? \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nThat is correct. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWhy do they use different language when they get to the other subsections? \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nThe second and third subsections deal with an insurer who already has issued a \nplan  to  someone.  Once  they  issue  that  plan,  they  cannot  limit  someone's \nbenefits based on their health status or deny them a benefit under the covered \nplan that they have already purchased based on their health status. The third \nsubsection says that once you sell someone a plan and they are covered under \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 6, 2019 \nPage 13 \n \nthe plan, the insurer cannot increase the prices for someone who has bought \nthe plan based on their health status.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThis does not require any insurance company to do something they do not \nalready do? \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nThat is correct. The intent of this bill is to conform to the ACA. Everything \nunder the bill is congruent with the ACA and no one is required to do anything \nmore than they are required to do under the ACA.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI have heard it said, \"With this bill I will finally be able to get insurance\". Will \nsomebody new be able to get insurance through this bill? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nNo, this bill does not expand any categories of beneficiaries. All it does is say, if \na plan is being offered that is covered by the ACA, that person cannot be \ndiscriminated against by their health status. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThis is revenue neutral to the State now and will remain that way unless the \nACA goes away? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThat would be my understanding. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIs that why the fiscal note is zero? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThat is why the fiscal note is zero. I would like to add for the record, a large \nnumber of lawyers have looked at this. There are many folks who are in the \nbusiness of offering these plans. It has been their sincere intent that we are not \nsweeping in anything new that is not already covered by the ACA. You saw \nfrom the testimony today, none of them testified in opposition. We may have to \ncreate another modest amendment, just to make absolutely certain this remains. \nWhat this bill does is something important. If we lose the ACA and we are \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 6, 2019 \nPage 14 \n \nforced into a discussion of what is best for the State of Nevada to ensure \npeople have access to health care, it will not be done on the backs of people \nwho have pre-existing conditions.  \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nWe will close the hearing for S.B. 235. \n  \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe will open the hearing for Senate Bill 192. \n \nSENATE BILL 192: Revises provisions relating to health care. (BDR 53-781) \n \nSENATOR PATRICIA SPEARMAN (Senatorial District No. 1): \nThis bill does two things. First, it establishes the minimum level of healthcare \nbenefits an employer must offer in order to be able to pay the lower minimum \nwage under The Constitution of the State of Nevada. Second, it creates the \nOffice of the Ombudsman for hospital patients within the Aging and Disability \nServices Division of the Department of Health and Human Services to advocate \nfor  the  health,  safety,  welfare  and  rights  of  hospital  patients.  I  do  have  a \nconceptual amendment (Exhibit L) that I will discuss later. It should eliminate \nthe fiscal note.  \n \nThe Constitution of the State of Nevada created a two-tier minimum wage in \nNevada. The lower rate is the same as the federal minimum wage, currently \n$7.25 per hour; this rate applies if the employer provides health benefits. The \nhigher tier is $1 more per hour and applies if the employer does not offer health \nbenefits. The Constitution of the State of Nevada defines health benefits as, \n\"Health  insurance  available  to  the  employee  for  the  employee  and  the \nemployee's dependents at the total cost to the employee for premiums of not \nmore  than  10  percent  of  the  employee's  gross  taxable  income  from  the \nemployer\". However, in 2018 the Nevada Supreme Court was asked to clarify \nthe definition of \"health benefits\". In the case MDC Restaurants, LLC v. The \nEighth Judicial Dist. Court of the State of Nevada in and for County of Clark, \nthe  Supreme  Court  determined  The  Constitution  of  the  State  of  Nevada \nminimum wage amendment,  \n \nRequires an employer who pays one dollar per hour less in wages \nto  provide  a  benefit  in  the  form  of  health  insurance  at  least \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 6, 2019 \nPage 15 \n \nequivalent  to  the  one  dollar  per  hour  wages  that  the  employee \nwould otherwise receive.  \n \nSenate Bill 192 seeks to further clarify the definition of health benefits and to \nclearly  identify  what  an  employer  must  offer  in  order  to  provide  the  lower \nminimum wage.  \n \nIn section 1 of the bill, it outlines the specific requirements the health benefits \nmust meet in order to qualify as health benefits under Article 15, section 16 of \nThe Constitution of  the State of Nevada. It also clarifies hospital indemnity \ninsurance,  which  pays  while  you  are  in  the  hospital,  or  fixed  indemnity \ninsurance, which pays a set rate. For example, $50 if you need x-rays does not \nqualify as health benefits under The Constitution of the State of Nevada.  \n \nThese  changes  eliminate  any  question  regarding  what  qualifies  as  health \nbenefits  under  The  Constitution  of  the  State  of  Nevada  and  ensures  that \nNevadans who are paid the lowest minimum wage have access to appropriate, \naffordable, health insurance coverage.  \n \nI have heard from several of my constituents who work at a job and receive the \nlower wage, were offered a plan known as a \"skinny plan\". This plan has a low \npremium,  but  many  of  them  do  not  cover  prescriptions  or  any  pre-existing \nconditions.  Some  people  might  be  attracted  to  them,  but  when  they  need \ncoverage, they really do not have anything. What S.B. 192 intends to do is \nclarify what a health benefit plan should be.  \n \nJEREMEY  GLADSTONE  (Assistant  Chief  Examiner,  Division  of  Insurance, \nDepartment of Business and Industry): \nThe proposed bill specifies the minimum requirement for health benefits that \nmust  be  offered  to  an  employee  in  private  employment  for  the  purpose  of \ndetermining the minimum wage that may be paid per hour. The benefits offered \nmust match the essential health benefits for the ACA, including those required \nto be included in an individual or group health insurance plan pursuit to NRS \n688, NRS 689A and NRS 689B, and provide at least a 60 percent actual value, \nsuch as a bronze plan in the ACA. Employer group plans do not have to offer \nessential health benefits, specifically those large employer group plans for 50 or \nmore employees. This bill would require all employer plans utilizing the lower \nminimum wage to offer the essential health benefits of the ACA, which includes \npediatric, dental and orthodontia.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 6, 2019 \nPage 16 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \n Are you testifying neutral on this bill? \n \nMR. GLADSTONE: \nI am neutral on S.B. 192, I am here to provide information to the Committee \nmembers. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe essential health benefits as defined in the ACA, is this the standard used to \ndecide who can pay $7.25 per hour compared to $8.25 per hour? \n \nMR. GLADSTONE: \nThat is correct. Currently, individual and small group plans that fall under the \nACA have to adhere to the ACA; however, if you are a large employer and have \nover 50 employees, then you would not have to meet those same requirements. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThis does not mandate that large employers meet the essential health benefits; \nhowever, if you do not meet the essential health benefits, then you do not \nqualify for the lower minimum wage. Is that correct? \n \nMR. GLADSTONE: \nThat is my understanding of the bill.  \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThe health benefit plan is defined in NRS 687B.470. This is a bill to make sure \nthat people who are paying that lower wage have the parameters that must be \nmet. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIf a person is making minimum wage, would they not already be on Medicaid? \nWould this supplant the Medicaid coverage?  \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI am not an expert in that. I think the Medicaid threshold is 138 percent of \npoverty level. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 6, 2019 \nPage 17 \n \nDENA SCHMIDT (Administrator, Aging and Disability Services Division, Department \nof Health and Human Services):  \nMedicaid covers 138 percent of the poverty level in Nevada.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nHow much does a person make at $7.50 per hour working for a year full-time \nand has one child? Where do they fall in the Medicaid eligibility chart?  \n \nMS. SCHMIDT: \nI cannot answer your question; it has been a while since I have done eligibility.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nDoes Medicaid cover dental and all the other health benefits? \n \nMS. SCHMIDT: \nI feel uncomfortable speaking on behalf of my sister agency, but I will do my \nbest.  Medicaid  does  provide  dental  care  for  children,  not  for  adults.  Any \nmedically necessary service is covered under the Medicaid program. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWould this bring the minimum wage on par with Medicaid for medical coverage? \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nA person making $7.25 an hour would gross $15,080 per year.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIf they made this, would they be below the Medicaid threshold? \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI am not going to say \"yes\" or \"no\". I would defer to someone who actually \nadministers the Medicaid program.  \n \nMS. SCHMIDT: \nExhibit L is a conceptual amendment. It removes the creation of the Office of \nthe  Ombudsman  for  hospital  patients  and  instead  requires  the  hospitals  to \nprovide  patients  with  information  regarding  their  rights  and  responsibilities. \nWhat we have found is that people do not know their rights and who to call \nwhen they have a complaint.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 6, 2019 \nPage 18 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nDoes this apply to anyone who goes into the hospital? \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nOver the last year, I had four or five instances where a patient called about \nthings that were out of sorts. One instance was a transgender woman, who had \nbeen shot and was in a rehabilitation center. She had some wounds that needed \ntended to and they refused to treat her. Her mother, who lived out of State, \ncame so that she could change the bandages. This rehabilitation center did not \nstop some of their employees from rummaging through her personal things. She \nwitnessed one of the custodians rummaging through her purse and pushed the \nbutton for someone to come and no one came. The most egregious thing that \nhappened to her was instead of them listing her by her gender identity, which \nhad been legally changed, they had her listed by her previous name.  \n \nOne of the pastors went in to visit her and heard her story. He picked up the \nphone and called me. I spoke to her and asked to speak to the person in charge \nof the rehabilitation center. The staff really did not have the time to talk to me. I \npicked up the phone and called the Director of the Department of Health and \nHuman  Services.  It  is  really  surprising  how  people  react  when  they  are \nconfronted with the agency that administers their license. Looking further into \nthis  instance,  this  lady  was  not  the  only  one.  There  was  no  one  there  to \nadvocate for her. When I get these kinds of calls, and I have gotten about five \nor six, I wonder who else is out there. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to \nmake sure there is someone to advocate for the patient and make sure these \ntypes of things do not happen. I feel that if we are going to improve the hospital \ndelivery  system  in  Nevada,  we  have  to  make  sure  that  patients  have  an \nadvocate.  We  can  implement  S.B.  192  with  the  conceptual  amendment, \nExhibit L, and not have a fiscal note. \n \nMOLLY ROSE LEWIS (NARAL Pro-Choice Nevada): \nI am speaking on behalf of the 45,000 members of NARAL Pro-Choice Nevada \nin support of S.B. 192.  \n \nMS. MAYLATH: \nMy name is Brooke Maylath and I represent the Transgender Allies Group out of \nReno. We are in support of S.B. 192. The stories told by Senator Spearman are \nnot unusual. Every patient needs an advocate to work for them when they are \nhospitalized. Everyone needs support. I also receive weekly questions from my \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 6, 2019 \nPage 19 \n \ncommunity; where can I get care, who is going to treat me properly or how can \nI file a complaint? I am overwhelmed by these calls, because there is such a \nneed.  \n \nMS. CAFFERATA: \nMy name is Elisa Cafferata and I represent Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada. \nWe are here in support. I want to speak to the minimum wage policy. I think \nwhen  the  State  adopted  this  policy  there  was  an  expectation  of  a  level  of \ncoverage that would accompany the change in the minimum wage. I think this \nbrings the policy in line with everyone's expectations.  \n \nJEOFF CARLSON: \nMy name is Jeoff Carlson and I am here from Las Vegas representing myself \nand my neighbors. I am a veteran and my first experience with an Ombudsman \nwas in the service. I can tell you firsthand, as a patient or an individual with an \nissue, having one person you know you can go to who will advocate on your \nbehalf is invaluable. I support the Ombudsman portion of S.B. 192. I hope the \namendment will do enough for those patients.  \n \nMS. KHAN: \nMy name is Amanda Khan and I am the Programs Director for the Progressive \nLeadership Alliance. I am here to express support for S.B. 192. Nevada needs \nminimum qualifications that will ensure employees are able to take advantage of \nthe health insurance policies offered by their employers when they need them. \nPatients need to be certain that when they are receiving care, their health, \nsafety,  welfare  and  rights  are  being  protected.  Creating  the  Office  of  the \nOmbudsman  for  hospital  patients  ensures  that,  if  needed,  a  patient  has  an \nadvocate to look out for their quality of care. \n \nJESSE WADHAMS (Nevada Hospital Association): \nI am here representing the Nevada Hospital Association. I would like to speak to \nthe Ombudsman portion of the bill. With the conceptual amendment, Exhibit L, \nthe Nevada Hospital Association can support S.B. 192.  \n \nMR. HACKETT: \nI am here on behalf of Nevada Public Health Association. We are here in support \nof the bill with the conceptual amendment, Exhibit L. We support efforts that \nprotect essential health benefits and we appreciate the emphasis on wellness \nand prevention in this bill.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 6, 2019 \nPage 20 \n \nMR. PICCININI:  \nMy  name  is  Shane  Piccinini  and  I  am  here  to  represent  the  Food  Bank  of \nNorthern Nevada. We support the bill. \n \nMS. LOCKHARD: \nMy name is Marlene Lockard representing the Nevada Women's Lobby and the \nRetired Public Employees of Nevada. We also support this bill. \n \nMR. BUSKER: \nI  am  Jared  Busker  representing  the  Children's  Advocacy  Alliance  and  we \nsupport the bill. \n \nMACKENZIE BAYSINGER (Human Services Network): \nMy  name  is  Mackenzie  Baysinger  here  on  behalf  of  the  Human  Services \nNetwork. We support this bill.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs there anyone in opposition to S.B. 192? \n \nPAUL MORADKHAN (Las Vegas Metro Chamber of Commerce): \nWe have spoken with Senator Spearman; however, we have concerns with \nS.B. 192. Our concerns are rooted in section 1 of the bill. I do want to clarify \nthe Las Vegas Metro Chamber of Commerce does not advocate the use of a \n\"skinny  plan\".  We  would  recommend  S.B.  192  be  amended  to  state  that \ninsurance plans conform with Nevada insurance laws given that it would provide \nflexibility, instead of having to rewrite the essential health benefit provisions. \nWe would recommend tying this to NRS 689B. We believe this would give \ngreater flexibility to the State, the Legislature and the Insurance Commissioner.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDo you have any closing remarks? \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI sent Mr. Moradkhan's concerns to the Legislative Counsel Bureau. I spoke to \nthe  Division  of  Insurance  to  make  sure  what  we  had  in  the  bill  actually \ncomported  to  what  is  in  law  with  respect  to  the  essential  elements.  I  will \ncontinue to work with them.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 6, 2019 \nPage 21 \n \nI am a veteran. I was medically retired and I will have health insurance until the \nday I die. There are a lot of people who do not have health insurance and for \nthose people, a cold that turns into pneumonia can be fatal. This is especially \ntrue for those working one or more jobs, and we know this to be the case for \nmany Nevadans. I feel that it is appropriate to make sure that whatever health \nbenefits are offered, they are benefits these people can use. Many plans do not \nmake sense. This bill is an attempt to align with The Constitution of the State of \nNevada. When the two-tier system was put in The Constitution of the State of \nNevada  there  were  certain  expectations,  and  up  until  this  point  those \nexpectations have not been met. People who work for a living and are doing the \nbest they can need our help and health insurance should not be a privilege; it is \na right.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRemainder of page intently left blank; signature page to follow. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 6, 2019 \nPage 22 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe are going to close the hearing for S.B. 192.

(BDR 38-77) \n \nSENATOR PAT SPEARMAN (Senatorial District No. 1): \nI am here today to present (S.B.) 203.  \n \nThere is an amendment (Exhibit C) to S.B. 203. To cover both categories, it \ninserts \"blind or visually impaired\" to the places where \"deaf or hard of hearing\" \nappear. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2019 \nPage 3 \n \nThe 2014 Gallaudet University study estimates 38,000 individuals who are deaf \nor hard of hearing live in Nevada. According to the National Federation of the \nBlind, more than 100,000 Nevadans are blind or visually impaired. \n \nChildren who are blind, visually impaired, deaf or hard of hearing deserve an \neducation equal to that provided to other children. They deserve systems and \nservices that ensure they can participate equally in society, develop language \nand literacy skills at an early age and attend schools that provide the services \nthey need. Are we willing to bring this aspirational goal to fruition? \n \nThis bill addresses three broad areas that will help ensure children in Nevada \nwho are blind, visually impaired, deaf or hard of hearing have systems that are \ndesigned and work for them. \n \nSenate Bill 203 establishes an account in the State General Fund to pay for \ncertain services for such children. It creates an advisory committee charged \nwith recommending criteria to evaluate language and literacy skills for children \nwho are blind, visually impaired, deaf or hard of hearing. It requires the creation \nof  an  interim  committee  (or  subcommittee)  to  study  the  possibility  of \nestablishing a public school for young people who are blind, visually impaired, \ndeaf or hard of hearing in Nevada. \n \nSection 2 of the bill creates the Account to Provide Programs and Services to \nChildren Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired, Deaf or Hard of Hearing in the State \nGeneral Fund. Money in the Account will be used to pay for programs and \nservices for children who are blind, visually impaired, deaf or hard of hearing. \nThe  Director  of  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  (DHHS)  is \nrequired  to  apply  for  available  grants  and  may  accept  gifts,  grants,  and \ndonations to the Account. \n \nSection 9 of the bill, along with the proposed amendment, Exhibit C, requires \nthe Superintendent of Public Instruction to establish the Advisory Committee on \nLanguage Development for Children Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired, Deaf or \nHard  of  Hearing.  The  Committee  must  include  members  who  specialize  in \nteaching or providing services to children who are blind, visually impaired, deaf \nor hard of hearing, parents of such students, or who perform research in a field \nrelating to such children. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2019 \nPage 4 \n \nThe  Committee  duties  are  outlined  in  section  10  and  include  making \nrecommendations regarding the criteria used to evaluate the development of \nlanguage and literacy skills by children who are less than six years of age and \nare deaf or hard of hearing, among other things. \n \nSection 11 requires the State Board of Education to make necessary revisions \nso  the  criteria  recommended  by  the  Advisory  Committee  meet  certain \nrequirements, adopt those criteria and develop a resource for parents of children \nwho are blind, visually impaired, deaf or hard of hearing. This will be used in \nevaluating their children's language development and literacy skills. \n \nSections  3  and  14  require  a  team  to  develop  an  Individualized  Education \nProgram (IEP) prescribing special education, or an Individualized Family Service \nPlan  (IFSP)  prescribing  early  intervention  services  for  a  child  who  is  blind, \nvisually impaired, deaf or hard of hearing, to use the criteria adopted by the \nState  Board  of  Education  to  evaluate  the  child's  language  and  literary  skill \ndevelopment. \n \nSection 13 of the bill requires the Department of Education and the Aging and \nDisability Services Division (ADSD) of the DHHS to publish an annual report that \nincludes aggregated data comparing the development of language and literacy \nskills in children who are less than six years of age and who are deaf or hard of \nhearing with the development of these skills in children of the same age who do \nnot have a disability. \n \nSection  15  requires  the  Legislative  Commission  to  appoint  a  committee  or \nsubcommittee to conduct an interim study of the feasibility of establishing a \npublic school for pupils who are blind, visually impaired, deaf or hard of hearing. \nThe Committee must consult with, and solicit input from appropriate individuals \nand organizations; consider potential sources of funding for such a school; and \nsubmit  a  report  of  the  results  of  the  study  and  its  recommendations  for \nlegislation. \n \nA society that does not take care of its very young, or those who are seasoned \nin age, is a society that is void of humanity. This is one of the things in Nevada \nwe cannot brag about. We do not have a school for children who are blind or \nvisually impaired, or children who are deaf or hard of hearing. We barely have \nprograms to give parents the ability to help their children with the foundation \nthey need for success. If passed, this bill will give parents the resources needed \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2019 \nPage 5 \n \nto put their children on the path to academic success and an independent life \nwhen they become adults.  \n \nApproximately 70,000 adults who are blind or visually impaired are unemployed. \nThey lack the skills to gain employment. This is important not only to us, but to \nthe children and their families.  \n \nDENA SCHMIDT (Administrator, Aging and Disability Services Division, Department \nof Health and Human Services): \nWe have been working with Senator Spearman on a conceptual amendment \n(Exhibit D). This program is similar to other programs within the DHHS.  \n \nIn  order  to  align  the  Account  being  created  through  S.B.  203,  we  have \nsuggested some changes. In section 2, subsection 2 of the bill, we seek to \nchange the word \"shall\" to \"may\".  \n \nThe second change would be to include the ability to use a portion of the funds \nfor the administration of the Account, as the Account is not currently funded. \nOnce it is funded, it will allow the agency to have access to administrative \nfunds to operate the Account.  \n \nThe third change would limit the funds for services to local government entities \nand non-profit organizations based on the need for services for the blind, deaf \nand hard of hearing.  \n \nALEXIS JONES: \nI am 11 years old and representing myself and my younger brother. We are hard \nof hearing and would both like the option of having a school for the deaf and \nhard of hearing in Nevada. It is essential to have a school to meet others, such \nas  ourselves,  and  develop  language  and  literacy.  Thank  you  to  Senator \nSpearman  and  Senator  Hardy  for  meeting  with  me  today  and  sharing  my \nartwork. \n \nMARIE SASSMAN: \nI am the mother of a hard of hearing child, Evan, here with me today. I would \nlove the opportunity to have a school that would service the hard of hearing, \ndeaf and blind. It would be a wonderful way to give our children a head start; \ngiving them the teachers they need. There is a very good school in Pittsburgh, \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2019 \nPage 6 \n \nPennsylvania. My husband and I spoke about moving out of State when my son \nwas younger, as there were no schools in place in Nevada.  \n \nEVAN SASSMAN: \nI am from Las Vegas and am so happy to be here. I would love the chance to \nattend a school for the deaf and hard of hearing. \n \nTANESHA JORDON-ROBERTS: \nI am an interpreter and a criminal justice major. My daughter is 29 and had to \nmove to Phoenix, Arizona to attend a school for the deaf. She also went to \ncollege at the Texas Tech University for the Deaf. She is a deaf actress in \nHollywood and I am very proud of her. However, it is important for Nevada to \nhave a school for the deaf. This bill would give our children the ability to have a \nvoice in their own State without outsourcing. I support S.B. 203. \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nYou mentioned in your amendment, you wanted to be able to administer the \nprogram with the monies that would be granted. Do you have an idea of how \nmuch, or the percentage of money that could be used? \n \nMS. SCHMIDT: \nIn the similar program in the Division of Public and Behavioral Health we have \nthe family account, which is 10 percent. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThis bill creates the fund. It is not asking for an allocation for the fund, but to \nopen up the opportunity for the DHHS and ADSD to accept grant funds that can \nbe specifically designated for this reason. \n \nThe bill asks the Superintendent to create an educational advisory committee, \nspecifically  making  sure  criteria  is  established  which  can  be  disbursed \nthroughout our education system. This is to ensure the focus is on language \ndevelopment for children who are visually or hearing disabled. \n \nThe newly established Committee will develop the criteria and the Board of \nEducation will adopt the criteria. The criteria will be used in the IEPs for these \nstudents. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2019 \nPage 7 \n \nIt also states an annual report be produced for how that will take place. An \ninterim study  will  be conducted to determine the feasibility of  developing a \nschool for the deaf or blind. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThis bill grew out of an attempt to find what would be needed to establish a \nschool for deaf and blind children. It is economically unfeasible. This bill will \nprovide a good foundation to do so. \n \nNot only do we not have a school for children who are blind, visually impaired, \ndeaf or hard of hearing, we lack many of the coordinated resources throughout \nthe State. There are some organizations that help with this. Unfortunately, they \nare not large enough and do not have the sufficient funds necessary.  \n \nWhat we are attempting with this bill is to acknowledge these are our children. \nWe have an obligation to ensure we help parents set the academic foundation in \nplace, ensuring children like Alexa and her brother have an opportunity to grow \nup in an environment that is as normal as possible. I am ashamed to say all of \nthe aspects of this bill are not in place. However, I am hopeful with the passage \nof S.B. 203 we will be able to take a good step forward.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI:  \nSection 2, subsection 3 of S.B. 203 speaks to the services provided for children \nwho are blind, visually impaired, deaf or hard of hearing. There are other bills in \nplay in both this Committee and other  committees, about supplying  hearing \naids.  Is  it  specifically  your  intention  for  this  to  be  only  for  services  and \nprograms,  or  would  you  have  an  interest  in  this being  expanded  to  include \nequipment to assist in the provision of those services? \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThe irony is, if you are eligible for Medicaid, your child is eligible for hearing \nequipment. If you are not eligible for Medicaid, it is up to your health benefit \nplan as to whether it provides the equipment, and what the deductible, co-pay \nwould be. Right now, if a parent is unemployed and eligible for Medicaid, the \nchild who is blind or deaf or hearing impaired can obtain a hearing aid.  \n \nParents can spend upward of $13,000 for hearing aids for a child before the \nage of 6. That is a large amount of money, but somehow we need to figure out, \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2019 \nPage 8 \n \nas a State, how we are going to get there. For parents who cannot afford this \nexpense, their child is going without the foundational skills. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThere is other good work happening here, however limited the resources. If \nDHHS  and  the  ADSD  are  applying  for  grants,  and  there  is  a  grant  source \nallowing for spending on equipment, we should not be restricted from applying \nfor that grant source because the law limits us to just programs and services. \nWe should look at including equipment in this legislation. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nWe are looking at that as a possibility as a vehicle through another bill.  \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nYou stated section 15 creates an interim study, although it does not appear in \nblue ink associated with an addition to the bill. However, it does say in the \nLegislative Counsel Digest that section 15 does create the interim study for \nwhich we will have the feasibility to create a school for the deaf and blind. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI stated a study by a committee or subcommittee. We may have 20 studies we \nhave decided on, but the funds for all of these studies are not available. By \nusing that language it gives us the flexibility, if we do not have it for an interim \nstudy, it can be a subcommittee of a larger committee. \n \nDR. RUDY MANTHEI (President, Nevada Blind Children's Foundation): \nI am an ophthalmologist who has been practicing in Nevada for over 30 years. I \nam also the President of the Board for the Nevada Blind Children's Foundation \n(NBCF).  In  support  of  S.B.  203,  I  will  read  from  my  written  testimony \n(Exhibit E).  \n \nVisual  impairment  is  a  diagnosis,  not  a  disability.  The  Phoenix  school  is  an \nexample of empowering and educating children to feel capable of achievement. \nIt has a 90 percent high school graduation rate. The State will offer a Blind \nAccess CharlieCard to all children at the age of 18. We want to empower these \nchildren to create a life and become part of the community should they choose \nnot to accept this card. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2019 \nPage 9 \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nI visited your facility over the summer. Does that include the building across the \nstreet? \n \nDR. MANTHEI: \nThe facility you visited is the building we currently occupy. There is a pre-school \nacross the street which is not included, but we have the potential to obtain. \n \nHANNAH BROWN (President Emerita, Urban Chamber of Commerce): \nSenate  Bill  203  proposes  to  provide  equal  opportunities  for  children  with \ndisabilities, especially children who are blind, deaf and hard of hearing. It has \nbeen established that children who start behind, almost always remain behind. I \nalso believe these children and adults should have access to any equipment \navailable to assist in making their lives as normal as possible. I am not speaking \nfor myself or any member of my family. Even with higher education degrees, it \nis extremely difficult for this class of individuals to become successful.  \n \nBAILEY BORTOLIN (Outreach and Policy Director, Legal Aid Center of Southern \nNevada): \nThe  Legal  Aid  Center  of  Southern  Nevada  supports  any  additional  services \nprovided to these children. We have a department representing children and \nfamilies trying to access educational assistance.  \n \nSections  14  of  the  bill  speaks  to  strengthening  Individualized  Education \nPrograms (IEPs) for these children which is heartening to us. We often find the \nresources  and  attention  for  this  particular  demographic  can  be  difficult  for \nschools to manage.  \n \nA good example would be a case we had recently of a child who is hard of \nhearing. What attributed to his difficulty in school was his hearing loss. It took \nthe school many years to realize he was also autistic. He was not offered the \nassessment, though this disability was credited with holding him back in school. \nProviding any additional training and resources available for those assessments \nfor the younger children will have a positive impact. \n \nERIC WILCOX (President of the Board (Reno), Nevada Hands and Voices): \nNevada  Hands  and  Voices  supports  S.B.  203.  I  will  read  from  my  written \ntestimony (Exhibit F). \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2019 \nPage 10 \n \nDAVID DAVITON (President, Nevada Association Of The Deaf, interpreted by Kim \nJohnson): \nI am against S.B. 203, but in support of certain aspects. I am in support of the \ninterim research; however, that is taking quite some time. The needs of the deaf \nchildren are currently being put on hold.  \n \nLEAD-K, Language Equality and Acquisition for Deaf Kids, a campaign for deaf \nkids, influenced bills passed in California and other states. Deaf children require \nexposure to language at birth, and this often does not happen. When these \nchildren are exposed to language, it is often too late. I would like to see LEAD-K \nlanguage included in S.B. 203. \n \nIt does not cost to research resources for available funding. Adding a hearing \naid provision to the bill is unnecessary. There are other bills addressing this \nissue. The bill appears to be a last resort, yet funds are available from the \nTelecommunication  Device  for  the  Deaf  surcharge  collected  by  the  Public \nUtilities Commission of Nevada. \n \nMAUREEN FRATIANNI (interpreted by Kim Johnson): \nI moved from Boston, Massachusetts, 30 years ago. When I moved here I was a \nphone equipment distribution agent. I have also been an advocate for deaf and \nhard of hearing Nevadans for 24 years. I retired in 2013 and do volunteer work \nat Hidden Valley Elementary School, where the program for deaf and hard of \nhearing students is for students from age 3 to students in the 6th grade. \n \nI notice language of these students is very far behind from where they should \nbe. Typically by age 5, the time when children start school, they will have a \ncommand  of  2,500  words.  The  deaf  children  I  work  with  may  have  5  to \n20 signs by 5 years old. That obviously shows they are language deprived. They \nstruggle with learning English, so I volunteer once a week as a language model. \nI am in support of S.B. 203. \n \nPENNI ECHOLS: \nI have a 4 year old daughter who is deaf-blind. I support S.B. 203 and will read \nfrom my written testimony (Exhibit G). \n \nI would like to explain what being deaf-blind means for my daughter. She uses \nAmerican Sign Language and spoken English, at her choice. In order to receive \neffective communication, we have to present to her left side as her right eye is \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2019 \nPage 11 \n \nblind.  She  behaves  like  a  deaf  child,  but  requires  additional,  special \naccommodations with low visual noise in the classroom and additional contrast \nwhen she is reading or seeing the blackboard as she has monocular vision.  \n \nMy daughter receives services from NBCF of Nevada. We are connected with \nother families through Nevada Hands and Voices and she is thriving; she is a \nrock  star.  We  are  in  need  of  a  State  school  to  provide  security  for  these \nchildren. As families receive services from non-profit organizations, the services \nare  not  guaranteed.  They  are  dependent  on  funding  and  the  whims  of  the \nboards  of  those  organizations.  She  deserves  to  receive  these  services  as  a \nresident of Nevada.  \n \nHaving a State school that services birth to 21 years of age will allow us to \nhave security with written IFSPs and IEPs. It gives us recourse when services \nare no longer being met. We receive deaf mentorship from Deaf Centers of \nNevada. Because we do not have an IFSP for that service, we do not get to \nmake up the missed lessons when there is no provider. The time for her brain \ndevelopment is short.  \n \nJOANNA JACOB (Dignity Health - St. Rose Dominican Hospitals): \nDignity Health - St. Rose Dominican Hospitals supports S.B. 203 to help support \nthe community in accessing additional services. Specifically in section 2, the \nprogram is to be set up in the General Fund to build on the services available. \n \nMARLENE LOCKARD (Nevada Women's Lobby): \nI would like to commend Senator Spearman and the sponsors of this legislation. \nThey have done a wonderful service by bringing this issue forward and helping \nto educate all of us in Nevada. There are so many unmet needs of which many \nof us are not aware. We urge your support of S.B. 203. \n \nJARED  BUSKER  (Associate  Director/Government  Affairs  Manager,  Children's \nAdvocacy Alliance): \nThe Children's Advocacy Alliance supports S.B. 203. \n \nALEXANDRIA CANNITO: \nI support S.B. 203. I first learned about the issue facing our deaf and hard of \nhearing when I was a news reporter in Reno. I was excited when this bill was \nintroduced. Sergio Alexis, to my right, reached out to me a few months ago. He \nis a student at Carson High School and wanted help with his American Sign \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2019 \nPage 12 \n \nLanguage class. He was working on a project to get an interpreter on the news. \nDuring  our  time  together  I  told  him  about  S.B.  203  and  introduced  him  to \nSenator Spearman, bringing us here today. \n \nSERGIO ALEXIS: \nI support S.B. 203. Alexandria has been helpful in getting my project under \nway. I think it would be fair to have an interpreter on the news as we have a lot \nof deaf and hard of hearing students who use American Sign Language. We also \nhave students who need support to feel better about transitioning into society, \nand need the opportunity to feel equal to those of the hearing society. \n \nJEFF  BEARDSLEY:  (Nevada  Commission  for  Persons  Who  Are  Deaf,  Hard  of \nHearing or Speech Impaired, interpreted by Rick Jensen): \nI support S.B. 203. The children who are deaf, hard of hearing, visually impaired \nand blind need a vision of hope. They need deaf role models and deaf-blind role \nmodels. A school will allow these children to see the potential for their future \nand believe they will be successful. It is about the children being able to aspire \nto their dreams. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 203 and open the hearing on S.B. 198. \n \nSENATE  BILL  198:  Revises  provisions  governing  eligibility  for  Medicaid. \n(BDR 38-744) \n \nSENATOR MELANIE SCHEIBLE (Senatorial District No. 9): \nI  am  here  to  present  S.B.  198  and  the  proposed  amendment  to  the  bill, \n(Exhibit H).  This  bill  is  intended  to  help  some  of  the  children  in  Nevada.  It \nextends, or codifies, Medicaid eligibility and enrollment for a full 12 months \nfrom  the  time  a  child  is  first  enrolled  in  Medicaid,  when  their  parents  first \nqualify.  \n \nOver the course of 12 months a lot of things can happen. One thing that should \nnot happen is the lack of insurance coverage being a surprise when visiting the \ndoctor. This bill states that every child, once enrolled in Medicaid, will remain \nenrolled for 12 months. This applies, even if their parents may make a little \nmore  one  month,  or  a  little  less  one  month,  or  have  any  other  change  in \ncircumstances. For a full year, parents and their children will know they will be \nable to access their Medicaid benefits in Nevada.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2019 \nPage 13 \n \nI have been fortunate to work with the Children's Advocacy Alliance (CAA) on \nthis bill and will have Emma Rodriguez from the CAA explain the technicalities \nof the bill.  \n \nWe have submitted a proposed friendly amendment, Exhibit H. It was suggested \nby the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services and tightens up some of the \nlanguage in the bill, but does not alter the substance of the bill. \n \nEMMA  RODRIGUEZ (Children's  Health  Policy  Manager,  Children's  Advocacy \nAlliance): \nI am here to present S.B. 198 and share statistics from the Children's Advocacy \nAlliance  Policy  Brief  (Exhibit  I),  and  will  read  from  my  written  testimony \n(Exhibit J).  \n \nSENATOR HARDY:  \nIf the economic status of the parents change and their income increases and \nthey  get  different  insurance,  does  this  mean  the  child  must  terminate  their \nMedicaid coverage? Would it be the child or child's representative who makes \nthe request for voluntary termination? \n \nMS. RODRIGUEZ: \nIn  the  amendment,  it  allows  for  a  voluntary  termination  of  eligibility.  For \nexample, a parent now receives employer sponsored coverage and wants to \nmove their child from Medicaid to their new coverage. This bill allows them to \ndo so. Yes, the child or child's representative would make the request. \n \nMS. JACOB: \nDignity Health – St. Rose Dominican hospitals support S.B. 198 and thank the \nChildren's Advocacy Alliance and Senator Scheible for their work on the bill. We \nsupport continuing this coverage. Access to continuous care is important for \nhealth outcomes. \n \nHEIDI PARKER (Executive Director, Immunize Nevada): \nAs Nevada's only statewide non-profit dedicated to immunizations, Immunize \nNevada saves lives by preventing disease and promoting health. We support \nS.B. 198 as there is a clear connection between having health coverage and \nbeing able to access life-saving vaccines.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2019 \nPage 14 \n \nMedicaid currently covers all recommended childhood vaccines at no cost, when \nadministered  by  an  enrolled  Vaccines  for  Children  Program  provider.  This \ncoverage  has  contributed  to  increased  access  to  vaccines  across  Nevada. \nUnfortunately, we still see significant gaps in immunization rates among those \nliving  below  the  poverty  level  who  are  eligible  for  Medicaid,  or  may  be \nuninsured.  \n \nWith an estimated 50 to 60 percent of Nevada's children eligible for vaccines \nthrough this program, ensuring Medicaid coverage continues without barriers, \nsuch as a gap in eligibility, is vital to keeping our children and communities \nprotected from disease.  \n \nGEORGE ROSS (Hospital Corporation of America; Sunrise Hospital and Medical \nCenter): \nThe Hospital Corporation of America and Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center \nsupport S.B. 198. There is a segment of the population where parents may \ndiscontinue Medicaid due a change in their financial situation. Even if they are \nable  to  purchase  insurance  on  the  exchange,  with  the  high  deductible  their \npolicy might have, it may inhibit them from providing their child with necessary \nservices. This bill will enable them to continue to seek medical care for their \nchildren when it is needed. \n \nJESSICA WISE (Food Bank of Northern Nevada): \nThe Food Bank of Northern Nevada supports S.B. 198. \n \nMICHAEL HACKETT (Nevada Public Health Association): \nThe Nevada Public Health Association supports S.B.198. Improving access to \nhealth  care  has  been  one  of  our  long-standing  priorities,  as  is  insuring  and \nprotecting insurance coverage, particularly for those underserved populations. \n \nCECELIA LAMPLEY: \nI am a mental health counselor and retired from the DHHS. When I worked there \nwe handled Medicaid cases. The work we did for children was totally disruptive \nwhen  they  were  taken  off  Medicaid.  It  was  very  difficult  to  continue  the \nrelationship developed with these children and their families. When it is broken, \nthey may have problems coming back because of the loss of contact with those \nthey have developed a relationship. I support S.B. 198. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2019 \nPage 15 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nDoes the State share for Medicaid go on and the federal rate stays the same? \n \nMS. RODRIGUEZ: \nYes. The federal match rate stays the same.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDoes this work on a rolling calendar, so whenever the child is enrolled, it is \n12 months from the date of enrollment? \n \nMS. RODRIGUEZ: \nThat is correct. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 198. \n \nCYRUS HOJJATY: \nI would like to make some general comments about Medicaid. Was the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act supposed to solve these kinds of issues? If a \nperson turns 18, I am sure they can apply for Medicaid themselves. There are a \nlot of things I like about Medicaid, although there are flaws in Medicaid and \nother government programs; it creates dependency.  \n \nAccording to the Center for Immigration Studies, legal and unlawful immigrants \ntake Medicaid at a higher rate than native-born Americans. Some children may \nbe American citizens, but their parents are not. These are the things we need to \nconsider; this is a federal issue.  \n \nMedicaid encourages single-mother parenthood, along with other government \nwelfare  programs.  Nuclear  families  are  preferred.  Corporations  can  give  an \nexcuse to pay lower wages and lower benefits so they do not have to provide \nhealth insurance for their employees, and people can go on Medicaid. We have \nmany corporations and wealthy people who are paying less taxes than they \nshould. The middle class ends up subsidizing these government programs for \nlow-income employees, such as those who are employed at Walmart.  \n \nThere  are  reports  showing  high-income  people,  or  wealthy  people  with  no \nincome, getting Medicaid. Given the fact that Medicaid is such a large part of \nour budget, our national debt is growing; we should make it more efficient.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2019 \nPage 16 \n \n \nWhy do people need health care? What is causing people to get sick? We need \nto look to the root cause of the problems. The junk food sector and the car \ndependent lifestyle causes the need for health care. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRemainder of page intentionally left blank; signature page to follow. \n   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2019 \nPage 17 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAs there is no further business, we will adjourn this meeting at 5:19 p.m. \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nVickie Polzien, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2019 \nPage 18 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nExhibit / \nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \n# of pages \n  A  1    Agenda \n  B  8    Attendance Roster \nS.B.203  C  1  Senator Pat Spearman  Proposed Amendment \nDena Schmidt / \nAdministrator, Aging and \nS.B.203  D  1  Disability Services Division,  Proposed Amendment \nDepartment of Health and \nHuman Services \n \nDr. Rudy Manthei / Nevada \nS.B.203  E  8  Written Testimony \nBlind Children's Foundation \n \nEric Wilcox / Nevada Hands \nS.B.203  F  4  Testimony of Support \nand Voices \nS.B.203  G  1  Penni Echols  Written Testimony \nS.B.198  H  3  Senator Scheible  Proposed Amendment \nEmma Rodriguez / \nS.B.198  I  2  Children's Advocacy  CAA Policy Brief \nAlliance \n  Emma Rodriguez / \nS.B.198  J  1  Children's Advocacy  Written Testimony \n  Alliance \n ", "19": "\nMINUTES OF THE  \nSENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n \nEightieth Session \nMarch 13, 2019 \n \n \nThe Senate Committee on Health and Human Services was called to order by \nChair Julia Ratti at 4:07 p.m. on Wednesday, March 13, 2019, in Room 2149 \nof  the  Legislative  Building,  Carson City,  Nevada.

(BDR S-680) \n \nJAMES OHRENSCHALL (Senatorial District No. 21): \nApplied  behavior  analysis  (ABA)  is  an  evidence-based  treatment  commonly \nprovided to children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). This treatment helps \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 13, 2019 \nPage 3 \n \nrecipients improve social interactions, learn new skills and engage in positive \nbehaviors. Research shows that intensive, long-term ABA therapy can result in \nbetter  outcomes  for  many  children,  and  improve  intellectual  functioning, \nlanguage  development,  daily  living  skills  and  social  functioning.  For  many \nchildren with autism, this means between 25-40 hours of ABA therapy every \nweek for at least several years. \n \nIn Nevada, registered behavior technicians (RBTs) account for the vast majority \nof professionals who provide ABA therapy. The RBTs are required to work under \nthe supervision of a licensed psychologist, licensed behavior analyst (LBA) or \nlicensed  assistant  behavior  analyst.  Despite  the  growing  number  of  RBTs, \nNevada families continue to face challenges accessing ABA services. \n \nOne challenge for families of children with autism is the limited number of hours \nin  a  week  during  which  school-age  children  are  available  to  receive  RBT \nservices. There are other demands on a child's time, such as school and the \neven more limited number of out-of-school hours. Nevada simply does not have \nenough RBTs to meet the demand for services. \n \nIn addition to this issue, children who have health insurance coverage through \nMedicaid  face  another  hurdle  to  access  ABA  services  due  to  the  State's \nextremely low RBT reimbursement rate. Senate Bill 174 aims to address this \nproblem by increasing the reimbursement rate for RBTs to attract additional \npeople to the profession to serve children with autism.  \n \nSpecifically, section 1 of the bill requires the Department of Health and Human \nServices (DHHS) to submit a request to the federal government to amend the \nMedicaid State Plan, to increase the fee-for-service reimbursement rate for RBTs \nto at least $48 per hour. \n \nIf the federal government approves the Medicaid State Plan amendment, the \nAutism Treatment Assistance Program (ATAP) within the Aging and Disability \nServices Division (ADSD) would be required to reimburse RBTs at an equal or \ngreater  rate  beginning  January  1,  2020,  or  whenever  the  amendment  is \napproved if after that date.  \n \nThese changes would not only make the RBT profession more attractive, they \nwould also make Medicaid's reimbursement rates more competitive with private \nhealth insurance. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 13, 2019 \nPage 4 \n \nIn section 2 of the bill is a requirement for the Legislative Auditor to conduct an \naudit  during  the  2019-2021  biennium  of  the  State's  Medicaid  Program, \nincluding  Medicaid  managed  care  programs,  ATAP,  and  any  other  evidence \nbased programs or services DHHS provides for children with ASD. The audit \nmust include, but is not limited to: an analysis of the capacity of people who \nprovide  these  services  and  wait  times  to  receive  them;  identification  and \nassessment of factors that inhibit access to and delivery of such services; and \nan analysis of associated revenues and expenditures, as well as any unspent \nfunds that have been appropriated for these services since July 1, 2015. \n \nIn conclusion, I have had parents tell me the night and day results that ABA \ntherapy has made for their children. We have made a difference in the lives of \nthe kids in Nevada, but there are still a lot of kids in need of this therapy.  \n \nBAILEY BORTOLIN (Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada): \nI have laid out a seven page thorough history and argument (Exhibit C) detailing \nwhy this bill is important. Today I will touch on some of the highlights. There \nare two types of insurance for children with autism; one would be Medicaid and \nthe other is ATAP, which is the State assistance program that bridges the gap \nbetween private insurance and the needs of a family. The Governor included a \nbudget enhancement to ATAP to eliminate the waitlist for ATAP. Unfortunately, \nthis does not cover the children with Medicaid, which is a large population. My \nwritten  testimony  covers  both  types  of  insurance;  however,  I  will  focus \nprimarily on Medicaid.  \n \nIn June of 2014, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued \na directive to states that required states to offer ABA services through the \nmandatory Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment program.  \n \nAs  a  result,  Governor  Sandoval  requested,  and  the  2015  Legislature \nappropriated, roughly $14.2 million for fiscal year (FY) 2016 and $28.4 million \nfor FY 2017. This amount includes State and federal funds. The money would \nhave  provided  ABA  therapy  to  1,879  Medicaid  eligible  children  beginning \nJanuary 1, 2016. The estimate was based on an assumption that 30 percent of \nthe 6,000 children reported by the State Board of Education who had autism \nwould be eligible for Medicaid. Today that 6,000 number has grown to about \n8,500 children.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 13, 2019 \nPage 5 \n \nMost of that money appropriated by the 2015 Legislature went unspent on \nABA. For the biennium some $2.3 million of the appropriated $42 million was \nspent on fee-for-service Medicaid. The caseload was 186 kids in June of 2017, \nand  the  Division  of  Health  Care  Financing  and  Policy  (DHCFP)  provided  no \ninformation regarding Medicaid children served by managed care organizations. \nWe know children remain on waitlists and children went unserved. This was not \na case that the money could not be utilized to serve kids; there were plenty of \nchildren who went without services. That budget appropriation did not seem to \nfix the problem. This is why we are back here today. \n \nThere is a shortage of professionals qualified to administer the required tests \nthat lead to an autism diagnosis for children on Medicaid. This breakdown in \nassessments has led to a specialized court in Clark County in the Juvenile \nJustice Program, just for children with a suspected diagnosis of autism, who are \nbeing charged with petitions of juvenile delinquency. This really illustrates the \nneed to get services to these children. They need medical assessments to be \nserved by Medicaid, otherwise they are served by the juvenile justice system.  \n \nI will highlight why a performance audit is needed in Exhibit C. The bottom line \nis far too many Nevada children with autism are not being served in a timely \nmanner  despite  available  funding.  The  delay  and  lack  of  services  greatly \ndiminish  their  quality  of  life  over  the  years  and  increase  expenses  for  the \nchildren's  parents  and  the Nevada  taxpayers.  The  cost  for  these  delays  in \nproviding  intensive  service  to  younger  children  is  covered  in  the  written \ntestimony from Dan Unumb, of the Autism Legal Resource Center (Exhibit D), \nand from Ken MacAleese of the Advanced Child Behavior Solutions, LLC written \ntestimony (Exhibit E) and the supplemental report (Exhibit F).  \n \nWhile we applaud the effort of the agencies and acknowledge progress, we \nhave a long way to go. The $42 million Medicaid projected cost of ABA services \nfor the 2017 biennium was built on serving a projected 1,879 children through \nFY  2018.  Medicaid  is  only  serving  553  children;  of  those  416  are  in \nfee-for-service and 137 are in managed care. There is also evidence that these \nchildren are being underserved.  \n \nThe ATAP is an important component. While we hope the Governor's budget \nenhancement  eliminates  the  waitlist,  this  program  has  received  budget \nenhancements in the past that have not served the number of children at the \nlevel we expected.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 13, 2019 \nPage 6 \n \nIn the 2017 biennium, ATAP was budgeted to serve 836 children, plus an \nadditional 290 kids covered by a budget reserve. As of December 2018, ATAP \nis only serving 648 children and has a waiting list of 442 children, with an \naverage wait time of 1 year. The wait time in southern Nevada is 413 days and \n213 days in northern Nevada. \n \nOf the 648 children on ATAP, 277 are identified as Medicaid recipients. One of \nthe first things the auditors should check is whether there is a double count of \nthese children who Medicaid counts as serving.  \n \nIt is now estimated that 1 in 59 children are born with autism by the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention and it is the younger children who can best be \nhelped. A legislative audit would identify barriers to serving the children and \nestablish a corrective action plan to address them. You can read on page 5 of \nExhibit C a list of possible identified barriers.  \n \nThe other part of S.B. 174 is the RBT rate increase to $48 per hour. At the time \nthe RBT rate was adopted at $31.31, providers identified it as a barrier to \nserving children on Medicaid and ATAP. Since there is a limited number of \nRBTs,  providers  chose  to  serve  children  covered  by  higher  paying  private \ninsurance. For example, Tri-Care pays $52 per hour.  \n \nAt the time the rate was adopted, ADSD stated it would study the utilization \ndata to determine whether the rate was a barrier. Four years have passed and \nthat has not been done.  \n \nThe Committee will hear from providers, why they feel this rate is inadequate \nand why they cannot operate at that rate. You will also see written testimony \nby providers who are taking Medicaid cases, but feel this rate is not sustainable \nand are threatening to leave the market. Daniel Unumb, President of the Autism \nLegal Resource Center, has submitted a chart of the Medicaid Reimbursement \nRates by State (Exhibit G). This charts shows that of the 34 states from which \nwe could obtain data, Nevada is on the bottom tier.  \n \nNevada is competing with neighboring states. Nevada's rates are considerably \nlower than all of the surrounding states except Utah. New Mexico, California, \nOregon and Washington all pay substantially higher rates between $44 and \n$55. The requested $48 per hour is a reimbursement rate equivalent to the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 13, 2019 \nPage 7 \n \nmedian of the 34 states. Providers in Utah said they feel their rate is a barrier as \nwell and 95 percent of Utah's waitlist are Medicaid recipients.  \n \nMedicaid recipients continue to struggle to find providers who accept Medicaid \nor  ATAP.  In  order  to  increase  our  rate,  Nevada  would  need  to  propose  a \nMedicaid State Plan Amendment to CMS using a cost-based rate methodology. \nThe surrounding states with higher rates have received approval.  \n \nIn  conclusion,  despite  funding  the  State  continues  to  fall  short  in  serving \nchildren with autism. A legislative audit can determine what the barriers are to \neffective services and propose a corrective action plan to address them. \n \nIt is obvious that the low RBT rate is a barrier. The ADSD should have no \nproblem putting forth the justification to the federal government for an increase \nas Nevada's neighboring states have done. This increase during the biennium \nwill require a fiscal note. Any increased expense will be well worth it in terms of \nsavings to families and the State.  \n \nJULIE OSTROVSKY (Member, Nevada Commission on Autism Spectrum Disorders):  \nI am one of five members of the Nevada Commission on Autism. I am here to \ntestify (Exhibit H) in support of S.B. 174. In closing, we voted unanimously \nto support the RBT rate increase.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs there anyone in support of S.B. 174? \n \nKEN MACALEESE PH.D. (Advanced Child Behavior Solutions, LLC): \nI  am  a  doctoral  level  Board  Certified  Behavior  Analyst  (BCBA)  and  LBA  in \nNevada. I am here representing myself and my company to testify, Exhibit E \nin support of S.B. 174. I have submitted a 13-page report, Exhibit F, provided \nby the DHCFP, which details the direct and indirect costs of autism.  \n \nLYNDA  TACHE  (Member/Parent,  Nevada  Commission  on  Autism  Spectrum \nDisorders): \nI am the parent of a 17-year-old with autism. I am here to testify (Exhibit I) in \nsupport of S.B. 174. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 13, 2019 \nPage 8 \n \nERIK LÖVAAS (the Lovaas Center): \nI want to go back in time and discuss the landmark study from the 1987, \nBehavioral Treatment and Normal Educational and Intellectual Functioning in \nYoung Autistic Children. I want to highlight two groups, an experimental group \nand a control group. The experimental group received 40 hours per week of \n1 to 1 treatment for children ages 4 and younger. The outcome of this 40 hour \nper week group was 9 of the 19 children mainstreamed into regular education \nclasses  without  assistance.  They  maintained  their  treatment  gains  into \nadulthood, contributed to the economy and their quality of life was improved. \nEight children were placed in language delay classes and two remained in autism \nclasses. The control group had 10 hours per week of 1 to 1 treatment for \nchildren age 4. In the control group, 8 children were placed in language delay \nclasses  and  11  in  autism  classes.  No  one  from  this  group  achieved  best \noutcomes.  This  highlights  treatment  intensity  is  important  for  children  with \nautism.  \n \nI wanted to find the most current RBT data and looked in the Medicaid Services \nManual provider type 85. From July, August and September of 2018, 604 RBTs \nwere enrolled, approximately one-third, 210 enrolled RBTs billed 1 to 1 using \ncodes 0364T and 0365T. Those 210 RBTs billed approximately 7.28 hours per \nweek each of 1 to 1, with the total number of hours for the third quarter of \n2018 being 19,867 hours of 1 to 1.  \n \nA total of 19,867 hours may sound like a lot, but if you divide 19,867 by \n40 hours per week, the recommended number of  hours a child needs, and \n13, the number of weeks in a quarter, you get 38 children served. If we go with \n25 hours per week, an accepted standard, 61 children in Nevada would have \naccess to Medicaid services.  \n \nWe have a deficit in RBT availability through Medicaid. I support the increase to \n$48 per hour, but would even consider incentivizing that rate with an additional \n$10 per hour.  \n \nLINDA HUA: \nI want to share my personal story with ATAP and ABA therapy. My child has \nbeen fortunate enough to receive this therapy since the age of four. The ATAP \nfunding has impacted our lives. We are a single income family, but not by \nchoice. I had to stop working to help with my child's therapy. Without ATAP, \nwe  would  not  have  been  able  to  afford  the  life-changing  therapy  for  our \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 13, 2019 \nPage 9 \n \ndaughter.  When  our  daughter  was  first  diagnosed  with  autism,  she  was \ncompletely nonverbal. Through ATAP, a team of therapists and tutors were \nformed  that  pushed  our  nonverbal  daughter  to  speak.  She  has  gained \ntremendous skills, knowledge, speech and a better quality of life.  \n \nGWYNNE PARTOS (Nevada Commission on Autism Spectrum Disorders): \nI am also a parent of a teenager with ASD. I will read my testimony (Exhibit J) \nin support of S.B. 174.  \n \nCONNER CAIN (Touro University): \nI am here representing Touro University in support of S.B. 174. Touro University \nhas  a  Center  for  Autism  and  Developmental  Disabilities.  It  averages  about \n500 patient visits per month. Nevada continues to need more RBTs. We believe \nraising this reimbursement rate will create greater access.  \n \nMICHELLE SCOTT-LEWING (President, Autism Coalition of Nevada) \nI am also a mom of two children with autism ages 17 and 18. I want to talk \nabout early intervention. I can attest my two children were both nonverbal, \ndelayed speech and walking, and in diapers until the age of five. Due to early \nintervention and ABA therapy, they are high functioning. My son is driving a car \nand started his own business. My daughter has become an entertainer. All \nproceeds she earns entertaining go to autism. I say this to let the Committee \nknow the potential is there, but children have to get early intervention.  \n \nWe were originally from Florida. The rate in Florida is higher and they do not \nhave the issues experienced in Nevada. The retention and the outcomes are \nbetter in Florida than here. As a resident of Nevada, I want to see that here. \nNevada is ranked number 50.  \n \nMISTY SHOFFNER (Behavior Analyst, Applied Behavior Analysis Institute): \nI have been in the ABA field for the past five years. Prior to that, I worked in the \npsychology field. I want to compare the ABA field to the psychology field. One \nto one psychological services pay more, often require less training, less risk, \nless work and less data than those performing one to one services in the ABA \nfield.  The  ABA  field  makes  between  35  and  50  percent  less  than  the \npsychology field. Nevada is really lacking options in the behavioral field. Our \nmost severe cases are referred out of the State. From working in this field I \nhave noticed a crisis developing.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 13, 2019 \nPage 10 \n \nI have chosen to work with teens. It is discouraging to work with teens who \nhave not had prior ABA services or access to them. These individuals lack any \nmethod of functional communication. These cases go understaffed and these \nchildren are not getting any younger. These people will become adults and they \ncannot speak and they will be in your neighborhood. Are we going to fund this \ncrisis by raising the pay rate for RBTs or are we going to fund it by building \nbigger correctional institutions?  \n \nKELLY VENCI GONZALEZ (Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada): \nI am the team Chief of the Education Advocacy Program at the Legal Aid Center \nof Southern Nevada. I primarily work with kids who did not get ABA therapy. \nOur kids are all Medicaid eligible from families of modest means. We work with \nthem through Autism Court, the only court in the country that works specifically \nwith kids who are suspected of having autism or have an autism diagnosis. The \ncourt is Diversion Alternatives for Autistic Youth. These kids are usually about \n14 or 15 and have gotten in trouble with the law.  \n \nMARC TEDOFF PH.D. (Applied Behavior Analysis Institute): \nI am the owner of the Applied Behavior Analysis Institute. We currently provide \nABA therapy to 41 children funded by Medicaid. I am here to testify (Exhibit K) \non the challenges we face with the current RBT reimbursement rate and why \nwe are in support of S.B. 174.  \n \nKERRI MILYKO PH.D. (the Learning Consultants): \nI am a BCBA at the doctorate level and a LBA. I am here representing the \nLearning Consultants. Today I want to review the required and indirect cost of \nrunning a compliant and ethical behavioral services agency (Exhibit L). We are in \nsupport of S.B. 174. \n \nMEGAN SZETO (the Learning Consultants): \nI am a BCBA and a LBA in Nevada. This afternoon I want to elaborate what it is \nlike  to  work  every  day  as  an  RBT  (Exhibit  M)  and  why  I  support  the \nreimbursement rate increase in S.B. 174. \n \nJON PAUL SAUNDERS (the Lovaas Center): \nI am a BCBA and part-time graduate instructor at the University of Nevada, Las \nVegas (UNLV). I teach ABA to future behavior analysts and teachers. I started in \nthis field a little over 20 years ago, when my little sister Megan Crandy was \ndiagnosed with autism. Currently, Nevada has ATAP, the insurance mandate to \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 13, 2019 \nPage 11 \n \ncover ABA and Medicaid coverage. The RBT rate increase is just one more thing \nNevada needs to get passed.  \n \nI  work  for  the  largest  provider  in  Nevada  and  we  have  not  enrolled  as  a \nMedicaid provider, because we cannot afford it. We want to serve more kids, \nbut we do not want to risk the other clients we are currently serving. If this rate \nwas raised, we will enroll as a Medicaid provider and help that population.  \n \nLENISE KRYK (the Lovaas Center): \nI am in support of S.B. 174. The Lovaas Center has taken the 40 hour RBT \ntraining, in-house. A lot of RBT courses are online, but we want to give RBTs \nthe practice and experience of working with children. The cost of our training is \n$120 to $130 depending on class-size, which is more than an online course. I \nrecently read an article stating there is a 30 percent annual turnover rate in the \nABA field. If you consider the cost of training and the turnover, the current \nreimbursement rate is inadequate. The requirement for RBT certification is great, \nbut it does not help if there are not have enough RBTs to provide the service.  \n \nWe have lost some of our families who had to transition to Medicaid providers. \nNow they want to know when we may become a Medicaid provider, because \nthey want to come back. They tell us the Medicaid providers they had to go to \nhave  not  been  able  to  provide  them  adequate  service.  They  can  only  do \nassessments. We would like to become a Medicaid provider, but cannot do so \nbased on the current reimbursement rate.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nHearing no opposition, is there anyone in neutral? \n \nROCKY COOPER (Legislative Auditor, Audit Division, Legislative Counsel Bureau): \nI  am  neutral  on  S.B.  174,  because  the  Audit  Division  is  nonpartisan.  As \nindicated in the fiscal note, there is no direct fiscal impact to the Audit Division. \nThe Audit Division is here to serve the Legislature. Most of our audits are \napproved by the Legislative Commission. We prepare a two year audit plan that \ngoes to the Legislative Commission and it was approved August 2018. We \nwelcome all audits approved by the Legislature during session. If approved, this \naudit would take priority over other audits on the two year audit plan. The only \ndelay would be the completion of another audit in the plan. Approval would not \nreplace or eliminate any other audit that has been approved by the Legislative \nCommission.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 13, 2019 \nPage 12 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWould this specific audit be in the rotation or is this a new request because it is \nnarrowly focused on this specific topic? \n \nMR. COOPER: \nThis would be a new audit. It would essentially go to the top of our list.  \n \nCORI MORE, PH.D. (Assistant Professor, Special Education, University of Nevada, \nLas Vegas): \nI wanted to add a few key figures that have not been stated. The average cost \nof autism treatment, loss of wages for parents, provider costs and the cost to \nsociety over a lifetime, can be $1.5 to $2.5 million per child. We know these \ncosts  can  be  reduced  by  up  to  66  percent.  Every  $3  invested  in  early \nintervention saves $11 to society. I receive several phone calls per week from \nparents looking for services they are not able to get. We know the delay in \nreceiving treatment is a costly delay in outcome.  \n \nROBERT TAYLOR: \nI have been a RBT for two years. Last summer, I quit my job because I made \nmore money driving for Uber and Lyft. I recently went back to work as a RBT in \nNovember. It was November in Las Vegas and Uber and Lyft were slow.  \n \nI was scheduled for three sessions a day. In the morning I drove to my first \nsession and worked 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m., then I drove 30 minutes to the \nnext house and that session started at 12:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m., then I drove \n45 minutes to the last session that started at 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. I told \nthem this had to change. I needed my sessions closer together, because I was \nspending a lot of money on fuel. I feel bad, because I went to school to do this \nand the families liked me. In the four months since my return, I could see the \npositive impact I had on the children. When I leave these jobs I feel like I am \nleaving a family.  \n \nMS. BORTOLIN: \nI would like to address the fiscal note. The fiscal note includes federal funds. \nThe way it is written, it would require federal approval before it would go into \neffect.  \n \nIn  conclusion,  you  have  heard  a  lot  about  the  need  to  increase  the  RBT \nreimbursement rate. This is a clear \"identified\" barrier, but we have many other \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 13, 2019 \nPage 13 \n \nbarriers when you talk to the families. There are many barriers such as why it \ntakes so long for an assessment, why children are in the juvenile delinquency \nsystem or why they have been told they can only have fee-for-service Medicaid. \nThe barriers were brought up at every Interim Health Care Committee meeting. \nWe  keep  saying  there  is  a  problem  getting  children  with autism  access  to \nservices.  The  performance  audit  will  allow  us  to  come  back  with  answers \ninstead of questions.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe  are  going  to  close  the  hearing  for  S.B.  174  and  open  the  hearing  for \nS.B. 202. \n \nSENATE  BILL  202:  Revises  provisions  relating  to  persons  with  disabilities. \n(BDR 38-685) \n \nSENATOR MARILYN DONDERO LOOP (Senatorial District No. 8): \nAccording to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \n1 in 59  children  were  diagnosed  with  an  ASD  in  2018.  Most  children  are \ndiagnosed after four years of age, though autism can be diagnosed much earlier. \nResearch  shows  that  early  intervention  can  significantly  improve  a  child's \ndevelopment. In fact, identifying autism early and providing appropriate services \nis  a  child's  best  opportunity  for  health  development  and  positive  outcomes \nthroughout life. \n \nBeing diagnosed with autism or having a child who is diagnosed with autism is \noften challenging for both the child and the family. While progress has been \nmade in Nevada to assist families of children with autism, we still have much to \ndo.  On  the  positive  side,  in  2016  the  Ackerman  Center  for  Autism  was \nestablished at the UNLV School of Medicine. The Ackerman Center provides an \nexample of how services can be integrated and developed around the need of \nchildren and their families. Established through a partnership between the Grant \na  Gift  Autism  Foundation  and  the UNLV  School  of  Medicine,  it  provides a \n\"medical home\" for Nevadans with autism from infancy to young adulthood, \noffering multispecialty diagnostic, treatment and intervention services in one \noutpatient  setting.  In  2017-2018,  the  Ackerman  Center  served  more  than \n4,000 children, two-thirds of who were from low-income households.  \n \nTo obtain many State and local services, children and their families must go \nthrough numerous evaluations to determine whether a child has autism and, if \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 13, 2019 \nPage 14 \n \nso,  the  types  of  services  the  child  is eligible  to receive.  This  may  include \nevaluations for services from ATAP, Medicaid and/or the school system. This \ncan be a time-consuming and arduous process, but it does not have to be so \ndifficult. \n \nSenate  Bill  202  aims  to  better  serve  children  with  autism  in  Nevada  by \nimproving coordination and efficiency of evaluations by State and local agencies \nto diagnose ASD. The goal of this bill is to make life a little easier for families \ntrying to ensure their children receive the services they need to achieve their \nmaximum potential.  \n \nSections 1, 5 and 8 of the bill require the State Board of Education, ATAP and \nthe DHCFP, which administers Medicaid, to coordinate so that to the extent \npracticable, a pupil is only required to receive one evaluation to determine his or \nher  eligibility  for  applicable  services  or  programs  for  individuals  with  ASD \noffered by these entities.  \n \nEnabling and requiring these agencies to coordinate evaluations is the correct \nsolution. Doing so improves efficiency and reduces the amount of time children \nand families must spend on activities that could and should be coordinated \nalready. \n \nSection 2 of the bill requires ATAP, DHCFP and the Nevada Department of \nEducation (NDE) to compile and submit a report every six months regarding \nbarriers to services for children with autism and their families, data concerning \neffectiveness, usage and accessibility of these services and any other issues \nrecommended for inclusion by the Nevada Autism Task Force. The report must \nbe  submitted  to  the  Governor,  the  Legislative  Counsel  Bureau,  the  Nevada \nAutism Task Force and the Nevada Commission on Services for Persons with \nDisabilities. \n \nSection 9 of the bill requires the NDE to provide to DHCFP and ATAP, with the \nconsent of the pupil's parent or guardian, the name of each pupil who has ASD, \nthe school in which the pupil is enrolled and contact information for the child's \nparent or guardian.  \n \nSections 1 and 5 of the bill require DHCFP and ATAP to conduct outreach to \nthese parents and guardians to determine whether the child is eligible for and \nmay benefit from available services.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 13, 2019 \nPage 15 \n \nSection 7 of the bill addresses a related, but slightly different issue. According \nto Autism Speaks, more than half of young adults with autism are unemployed \nand unenrolled in higher education in the two years following high school—a \nlower rate than young adults with different types of disabilities. Research shows \nthat  job  activities  encourage  independence,  reduce  autism  symptoms  and \nenhance  daily  living  skills.  To  assist  individuals  with  a  disability  in  gaining \nemployment, Nevada law currently requires an appointing authority who has a \nposition available to make whenever possible, a temporary limited appointment \nof a certified person with a disability for up to 700 hours. This provision is \nimportant  for  individuals  with  disabilities,  including  those  with  autism.  This \nsection  simply  requires,  when  a  person  with  a  disability  is  appointed  to  a \ntemporary job he or she is qualified to do, the appointing authority must provide \nthe person with a monthly performance evaluation and indicate whether the \nappointing authority anticipates appointing the person to a permanent position. \n \nI believe you will hear from at least one individual this afternoon who would \nhave benefitted from this provision and inspired this statutory change. \n \nThroughout my career as an educator and a school librarian, I have had the \nopportunity to work with children with autism. I know that we can do much \nmore to support these children in Nevada, and the earlier we can provide them \nwith the services they need, the better off they and all of us will be.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nDoes S.B. 202 have a fiscal note of $67 million? \n \nSENATOR DONDERO LOOP: \nYes, that is a fiscal note, but we are going to address it. \n \nTERRI JANISON (President, Grant a Gift Autism Foundation): \nI am the President and CEO of the Grant a Gift Autism Foundation (GGAF) in \nLas Vegas, Nevada. I have submitted testimony (Exhibit N) detailing the unique \npartnership between GGAF and the UNLV School of Medicine. We expect this \nmodel will become the standard for autism diagnosis, treatment and research.  \n \nMARIO GASPAR DE ALBA, M.D. (Chair, Nevada Commission on Autism Spectrum \nDisorders): \nI  am  a  Developmental-Behavioral  Pediatrician  and  the  Chair  of  the  Nevada \nCommission  on  Autism  Spectrum Disorders.  Nevada  does  not  have  enough \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 13, 2019 \nPage 16 \n \nspecialists or providers, which creates a waitlist for assessments and services. \nIn addition, passing S.B. 202 will help streamline the eligibility assessments for \npatients and families. My written testimony (Exhibit O) discusses why I am in \nsupport of S.B. 202.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI have some questions about the appointing agency outlined in section 7. \n \nSTEVEN COHEN: \nI am looking at S.B. 202 as well as the Rehabilitation Division's version of this \nvery same section of S.B. 50. The appointing authority, as an example, would \nbe Medicaid or any agency that has a position available.  \n \nSENATE  BILL  50:  Revises  provisions  governing  the  temporary  limited \nappointment of persons with disabilities by state agencies. (BDR 23-230) \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWho are we appointing and what are we appointing them to do? \n \nSENATOR DONDERO LOOP: \nThere is a program called the 700-Hour Program. As in Mr. Cohen's case, he did \nthe  entire  700-Hour  Program  before  he  was  told  he  would  not  be  hired. \nSenate Bill 202 puts in place a person who would work side-by-side so to \nspeak, with the person hired throughout the 700-Hour Program. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe will hear testimony in support. \n \nDR. GASPAR DE ALBA: \nI would like to clarify something. Within S.B. 202, it replaces the \"Nevada \nAutism  Task  Force\"  with  the  \"Nevada  Commission  on  Autism  Spectrum \nDisorders\".  \n \nJANICE  JOHN  (Deputy  Administrator,  Rehabilitation  Division,  Department  of \nEmployment, Training and Rehabilitation): \nAssembly  Bill No.  192  of  the  79th  Session  was  approved  and  enacted.  It \nallowed the Rehabilitation Division to certify certain individuals with disabilities \nto  be  placed  on  the  700-Hour  list.  We  certify  the  list  and  work  with  the \nindividuals. Once they are deemed to have the skills, abilities and knowledge to \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 13, 2019 \nPage 17 \n \nqualify for certain State positions, then we present a letter to the Division of \nHuman Resource Management, which certifies the 700-Hour list.  \n \nThis law mandated that individuals on the 700-Hour list be considered first by \nthe appointing authority. If they were on the list and eligible, the appointing \nauthority had to hire the person from the 700-Hour list. Senate Bill 50 seeks a \nlanguage change from a \"must hire\" to \"can hire\" from the 700-Hour list. The \nintent of A.B. No. 192 of the 79th Session was that agencies would consider \nindividuals with disabilities, not that they must hire them.  \n \nWhen someone is working 700 hours for an agency they are considered a State \nemployee for that period of time and they are on probation during that time. \nThey are eligible for a three-month evaluation. I do not know if the three-month \nevaluation  is  a  mandate  or  optional.  It  is  not  optional  to  skip  seven  and \neleven-month evaluations. The idea of someone getting an evaluation every \nmonth is perhaps an option an agency could consider.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSenate Bill 202 states if you are hired from the 700-Hour list, before you get \nhired  from  the  list  or  after  you  get  hired  from  the  list  you  get a  monthly \nevaluation. Are the monthly evaluations before or after? \n \nMS. JOHN: \nI believe the evaluations are during the 700-hour period of time. When they are \nhired, they will be given an evaluation each month. The 700 hours goes toward \nthe one-year evaluation.  \n \nDESIRAE  WINGERTER  (Programs  Services  Manager,  Grant  a  Gift  Autism \nFoundation): \nI am an Assistant BCBA. I am in support of S.B. 202, but propose a friendly \namendment  to  address  the  age  discrepancy  between  ATAP,  Clark  County \nSchool District and Medicaid outlined in my testimony, (Exhibit P), over adult \neligibility for various support services.  \n \nMR. COHEN: \nThe one clarification I want to make is I made it through the entire 700-Hour \nProgram and was transitioned to permanent probation. I was released from \nState service January 2, which was one month before I would have attained \nfull-time status.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 13, 2019 \nPage 18 \n \nWILLIAM HORNE (Clark County School District): \nI am here today representing Clark County School District. We are in support of \nS.B. 202; however, on the Nevada Electronic Legislative Information System \n(NELIS) there is a fiscal note of $80,000 for FY 2019-2020 and 2020-2021, for \na total of $160,000. We are going to remove that fiscal note. It was originally \nthought  there  would  be  a  need  for  additional  staff  and  that  will  not  be \nnecessary. I spoke with Senator Dondero Loop and we are in the process of \nremoving the fiscal note.  \n \nMS. BORTOLIN: \nI want to speak briefly for the assessment coordination between schools and \nhealth care. As a lawyer in Autism Court, we see children who have been \nidentified  as  having  autism  in  order  to  be  redirected  to  the  Autism  Court; \nhowever, they lack the assessment necessary to get medical services. We are \nable to redirect children through the legal system, but we are not able to get \nthem connected with the doctors and providers needed to get the treatment \nthat will change their lives. We often see the schools have identified them as \nhaving autism, but the school assessment is not accepted by the doctors. In \nother instances, they are Medicaid eligible, but Medicaid was not made aware \nthe child is labeled as a child with autism. We would like to see when one \nauthority has recognized the child needs help, we can reach out to other sectors \nand connect that child with help.  \n \nFinding an autism assessment spot in court is difficult. For example, in July we \nwill schedule a court day for October and we are excited to have an assessment \nspot available. The first child will come in and need an assessment. The next \nchild will come in and need the assessment even more because they are closer \nto age 18. We will cancel the first child's appointment. We then get a third child \nneeding an assessment, or they will be diverted to an adult court. We have to \ncancel the assessment for the second child. By the end of the day one child has \nreceived an assessment that was scheduled months out. We know that all three \nchildren in this courtroom have autism, or they would not be there. We want to \nincrease those services and the communication to make sure these children are \nbeing assessed as early as possible.  \n \nMS. SCOTT-LEWING: \nI am the President of the Autism Coalition of Nevada. I did not mention earlier \nthat it is a volunteer job. For the past 28 years, I have worked as a regulatory \naffairs officer for a medical device company. I work in pediatric ear, nose and \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 13, 2019 \nPage 19 \n \nthroat, and neurosurgery. This gives me a bird's-eye view of the comorbidities \nof  autism,  which  are  medical.  Today,  we  have  talked  mainly  about  the \ntherapeutic  aspects  of autism.  Another critical component  of  autism  is  the \nmedical comorbidities, such as seizure disorder and gastrointestinal issues. All \nof these issues lend themselves to the overall health of these individuals. This is \nwhy it is critical to have an autism diagnosis as soon as possible. This would \ngive them access to all of the resources Medicaid could offer them.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSeeing no one in opposition, is there anyone who wants to testify in neutral? \n \nDR. MORE: \nOne of the biggest confusions that parents face when looking at an autism \ndiagnosis  is  the  difference  between  the  school  diagnosis  and  the  medical \ndiagnosis. They may use similar tools. The school diagnosis is made by the \nindividualized education team, or the multi-disciplinary team, who writes the \nindividualized  education  plan.  This  diagnosis  typically  involves  a  school \npsychologist, a speech therapist, special education teacher and the parents. The \nmedical diagnosis is done by someone in the medical field such as a clinical \npsychologist  and/or  a  developmental  pediatrician.  This  bill  provides  an \nopportunity  to  remove  some  of  those  barriers  between  the  two  different \nsystems.  \n \nSUZANNE BIERMAN (Administrator, Division of Health Care Financing and Policy, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nWe are testifying in neutral. Our concern is federal regulations that require \nservices  reimbursable  through  Medicaid  have  a  clinical  diagnosis  and  meet \nmedical necessity requirements in order for us to claim the federal matching \nfunds.  This  is  why  the  clinical  diagnosis  is  critical  for  the  medical \nreimbursement.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI know this is a policy Committee, but we had earlier questions with regard to \nthe fiscal note. We know Clark County is going to remove the fiscal note by \nlocal governments, but there is still a $14 million first year and $33 million \nsecond  year  fiscal  note  from  the  ADSD.  As  I  understand  it,  there  is  a \ncoordination of the evaluation and this leads to more children diagnosed with \nautism and this is what leads to the higher cost to provide those services. Is \nthat correct? \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 13, 2019 \nPage 20 \n \nSENATOR DONDERO LOOP: \nYes, that is my understanding. While I recognized this is a large fiscal note, I \nheard a couple entities are reviewing the fiscal note, much in the way Clark \nCounty did. At this time, I would rather not speak for them on this issue.  \n \nDENA SCHMIDT (Administrator, Aging and Disability Services Division, Department \nof Health and Human Services): \nMedicaid has a medical necessity requirement and ATAP, which is a State \nfunded program accepts both the educational and the medical assessment. The \nfiscal note associated with S.B. 202 is due to the outreach requirement. It is \nanticipated the outreach will increase our caseload dramatically.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAs I understand it there is a waiting list for ATAP, but the Governor's Budget \nhas an enhancement to address that waiting list. Does this fiscal note take into \nconsideration the enhancement in the Governor's Budget? \n \nMS. SCHMIDT: \nThat is correct. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThis fiscal note does not reflect the proposed rate increase that we heard in \nS.B. 174, is that correct? \n \nMS. SCHMIDT: \nThat is correct. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDo you have any closing remarks? \n \nSENATOR DONDERO LOOP: \nThere are children who are waiting and they cannot get Medicaid, because they \nhave not been diagnosed. I know several families, my sister-in-law is one of \nthem, who had to leave the State to get services for her children. It makes me \nsad to know we have people in need, and we just cannot seem to move fast \nenough.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 13, 2019 \nPage 21 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe will open the hearing for S.B. 216. \n \nSENATE BILL 216: Revises provisions relating to autism spectrum disorders. \n(BDR 38-33) \n \nSENATOR OHRENSCHALL: \nI am here to present S.B. 216. Assembly Bill No. 629 of the 74th Legislative \nSession appropriated funding to create the Nevada Autism Task Force. The \nNevada Autism Task Force was responsible for studying the growing incidence \nof autism and ways to improve the delivery and coordination of autism services \nin  the  State  and  for  making  recommendations  to  the  Governor  and  the \nLegislature. The Nevada Autism Task Force was required to complete its review \nby August 1, 2008. However, on November 19, 2008, Governor Jim Gibbons \nissued an Executive Order creating the Nevada Commission on Autism Spectrum \nDisorders to continue the work of the Nevada Autism Task Force. The work of \nthe  Commission  was  further  extended  through  Executive  Orders  issued  by \nGovernor Brian Sandoval in 2011, 2015 and 2018.  \n \nIn sections 5 and 6 of S.B. 216, it would permanently establish the Nevada \nCommission  on  Autism  Spectrum  Disorders  in  the  Nevada  Revised \nStatutes (NRS). The Commission will continue to be located within the ADSD \nand they are responsible for providing administrative support. \n \nSection 5 outlines the Commission's membership and limits membership to a \nthree-year term with the option of reappointment. \n \nSection 6 requires the Commission to meet eight times each year at the call of \nthe Governor, the Chair or a majority of membership.  \n \nThe  duties  of  the  Commission  would  include:  advising  and  making \nrecommendations to the Governor regarding the needs of people with ASD and \ntheir families and the availability, delivery and coordination of services for these \nindividuals  in  Nevada;  reviewing  available  data  concerning  individuals  with \nautism, such as the ages of people served by public programs for people with \nautism; waiting lists for such programs and the outcomes of services provided \nby public agencies; and submitting a report to the Governor. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 13, 2019 \nPage 22 \n \nIn an effort to ensure the Commission has necessary data, sections 1 and 7 \nrequire  the  DHCFP,  that  administers  Medicaid,  and  ADSD  that  administers \nATAP, provide the Commission with specific information regarding the services \nthese agencies provide to individuals with autism.  \n \nSection 9 of S.B. 216 eliminates an existing requirement that the assessment \nADSD  is  required  to  prescribe  by  regulation  for  measuring  outcomes  and \nassessing and evaluating people with autism up to 21 years of age who receive \nservices through the State or local government, must be standardized.  \n \nSection 10 replaces existing references to the Nevada Autism Task Force with \nreferences  to  the  newly  created  Nevada  Commission  on  Autism  Spectrum \nDisorders. It also requires \"the treatment plan\" ATAP develops for a young \nperson with autism, ensures he or she will receive appropriate services from \nanother entity after reaching 20 years of age. This section is crucial to ensuring \ncontinuity of care for children and young adults with autism who inevitably \nbecome adults with autism.  \n \nIn 2007, as a freshman Assemblyman, I was appointed to the Interim Task \nForce. While serving on the Interim Task Force, I met Ralph Toddre and Jan \nCrandy. They pitched the idea to the Interim Task Force of a bill that would \nrequire children with autism get services through their health insurance, and \nthey detailed the fact that most insurance policies in Nevada excluded ABA \ntherapy for children. In 2009, I was able to introduce such a bill and it did pass.  \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nI have some questions about the language in sections 9 and 10. \n \nDR. GASPAR DE ALBA: \nThe  language  is  stricken  because  of  the  tool  requirement.  The  diagnostic \nguidelines by the American Academy of Pediatrics do not require a tool be used. \nThey require an evaluation with specific parts, but no specific tool to determine \nif  a  child meets  eligibility  by  that  specific  diagnosis  by  the Diagnostic  and \nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, DSM-5 standards.  \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND:  \nSection  9  refers  to  a  standardized  tool  and  section  10  is  a  standardized \nassessment and that is perfectly fine? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 13, 2019 \nPage 23 \n \nDR. GASPAR DE ALBA: \nYes, that is correct. \n \nMS. PARTOS: \nI am a member of the Nevada Commission on Autism Spectrum Disorders and \nwe serve on a voluntary basis; however, I do not believe we would be able to \ncontinue without the administrative support.  \n \nAutism is a complex disorder. There is a saying if you meet one person with \nautism, you have met one person with autism. It is not just the people with \nautism  who  need  the  treatment.  Autism  impacts  the  families  and  the \ncommunities  as  well.  There  is  a  real  need  for  the  Nevada  Commission  on \nAutism, because of the complexity of autism. \n  \nMS. OSTROVSKY: \nI have a 21-year-old son with autism and that is why I started working with the \nCommission and working in the autism community. I will read my testimony \n(Exhibit  Q)  outlining  the  need  for  a  permanent  Commission  proposed  by \nS.B. 216 and the reason we are hearing so many autism bills this Session.  \n \nDR. GASPAR DE ALBA: \nI am the Chair of the Commission. Passing S.B. 216 will allow the Commission \nto  continue  its  work  permanently  and  not  rely  on  executive  orders.  The \nCommission serves an important role in collecting and reviewing information and \ndata related to autism and autism services. We also receive information from \nfamilies relative to the current barriers they face in attempting to find diagnosis \nand  treatment  services  for  their  children.  The  Commission  compiles  that \ninformation highlighting recommendations and information that might improve \nthe availability, coordination and delivery of services to families affected by \nautism and provides it to the Governor and his staff. \n  \nThe Commission uses that data to help improve and shape new and existing \npolicy,  including  several  of  the  bills  introduced  this  Legislative  Session. \nSenate Bill 216 improves the coordination and the flow of information between \nState agencies and brings that information under the Commission for review, \nallowing  the  identification  of  unnecessary  redundancies,  areas  of  need  and \ninsufficiency and services and programs that are demonstrating appropriate and \nexpected improvements.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 13, 2019 \nPage 24 \n \nWithout the Commission, the State's autism programs and service delivery are \nat risk of creating silos rather than collaboration. The Governor and Legislators \nwill lose important autism information in our State. The voice, concerns and \nparticipation of autism families will certainly decrease. Without the Commission, \nwe risk losing a group of professionals and family members deeply invested in \nthe autism community.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSeeing no opposition, is there anyone neutral? \n \nDR. MORE: \nNevada takes autism seriously. Nevada was one of the first states to require \nlicenses for BCBAs and the Commission takes autism seriously. As an educator, \nthe Commission is a great tool and source of valuable information.  \n \nGWEN DWIGGINS, PH.D. (Accelerated Learning Clinic): \nI am a BCBA at the doctoral level. I teetered on being opposed versus neutral. \nI have concerns in regard to the wording in this bill. While Dr. Gaspar de Alba \ndid some clarifications about a standardized assessment, some of the other \nwording makes me nervous. These are the same concerns (Exhibit R) I had for \nS.B.  174.  I  do  not  want  individuals  who  are  not  qualified  to  be  giving \nassessments.  I  think  we  have  to  be  careful  about  the  wording.  Behavior \nanalysts are not qualified to give a diagnosis of autism; it goes outside of their \nscope of practice. I see the Commission will be prescribing the regulations of \nwhat this standard assessment would look like and I look at the individuals who \nare nominated to this Commission and I do not necessarily see an individual \nwho is qualified to make those standards.  \n \nA behavior analyst without a psychological background should not be making \ndecisions about assessments. A school district individual, unless they are a \nschool psychologist, should not be making decisions about those assessments. \nA  parent  should  not  be  making  recommendations  about  what  those \nassessments  are.  I  support  streamlining  assessments  and  making  them \naccessible. I know that is a barrier. I would offer suggestions to reword how it \nis written.  \n \nDR. GASPAR DE ALBA: \nI  would  like  to address  the  concern about  a  standardized assessment.  The \nCommission will create a subcommittee. That subcommittee can be staffed by \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 13, 2019 \nPage 25 \n \nthose who are qualified to determine what a standardized assessment would \nlook like, taking into account best practices provided both on the psychological, \nas well as the medical side. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will leave it up to Senator Ohrenschall to determine if there needs to be more \nclarification in S.B. 216.  \n \nSENATOR OHRENSCHALL: \nI will reach out to the speaker and determine if there is a desire to fine tune the \nlanguage.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRemainder of page intentionally left blank; signature page to follow. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 13, 2019 \nPage 26 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSeeing no further business, I adjourn the hearing at 6:28 p.m. \n \n \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nMichelle Hamilton, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 13, 2019 \nPage 27 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nExhibit / \nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \n# of pages \n  A  1    Agenda \n  B  8    Attendance Roster \nBailey Bortolin / Legal Aid \nS.B. 174  C  7  Written Testimony \nCenter of Southern Nevada \nDaniel Unumb / Autism \nS.B. 174  D  2  Written Testimony \nLegal Resource Center  \nKen MacAleese / Advanced \nS.B. 174  E  1   Child Behavior Solutions,  Written Testimony  \nLLC \nKen MacAleese /  \nS.B. 174   F  13  Advanced Child Behavior  Report \nSolutions, LLC \nDaniel Unumb / Autism \nS.B. 174  G  1  Chart \nLegal Resource Center  \nJulie Ostovsky / Nevada \nS.B. 174  H  1  Commission on Autism  Written Testimony \nSpectrum Disorders \nLynda Tache / Nevada \nS.B. 174  I  2  Commission on Autism  Written Testimony \nSpectrum Disorders \nGwynne Partos / Nevada \nS.B. 174  J  1  Commission on Autism  Written Testimony \nSpectrum Disorders \nMarc Tedoff / Applied \nS.B. 174  K  1  Written Testimony \nBehavior Analysis Institute \nKerry Milyko / the Learning \nS.B. 174  L  1  Written Testimony \nConsultants \nMegan Szeto / the Learning \nS.B. 174  M  2  Written Testimony \nConsultants \nTerri Janison / Grant a Gift \nS.B. 202  N  2  Written Testimony  \nAutism Foundation \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 13, 2019 \nPage 28 \n \nMario Gaspar de Alba / \nS.B. 202  O  2  Nevada Commission on  Written Testimony \nAutism Spectrum Disorders \nDesirae Wingerter / Grant a \nS.B. 202  P  1  Written Testimony \nGift Autism Foundation \nJulie Ostrovsky / Nevada \nS.B. 216  Q  1  Commission on Autism  Written Testimony  \nSpectrum Disorders \nGwen Dwiggins / \nS.B. 174  R  2  Written Testimony \nAccelerated Learning Clinic \n ", "20": "\nMINUTES OF THE  \nSENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n \nEightieth Session \nFebruary 25, 2019 \n \n \nThe Senate Committee on Health and Human Services was called to order by \nChair Julia Ratti at 11:05 a.m. on Monday, February 25, 2019, on the Senate \nFloor of the Legislative Building, Carson City, Nevada.

I  have  provided \nbackground information for your review (Exhibit C, Exhibit D and Exhibit E). \nI will go over the highlights of why we are here to revisit the bill passed in \n2017.  \n \nThe safety net for providing family planning for low-income women in Nevada \nhas been eroding for years and is especially problematic in rural Nevada. In \n2017, S.B. No. 122 of the 79th Session was passed establishing a program to \nprovide  grants  for  family  planning  services,  resulting  in  direct  health  care \nbenefits to the people who need it the most. \n \nThere are advantages to having a State funded family planning grant program; it \ncan  be  responsive  to  specific  needs  in  our  community.  The  needs  of  rural \nNevada might be slightly different from those in Las Vegas or Washoe County. \nIt  is  structured  in  a  way  that  supports  increased  access  to  health  care  for \nNevada families. It also allows us to offer a slightly broader range of health care \nservices, such as immunizations and pre-pregnancy counseling so we can help \nyoung people start a family when they are ready. \n \nThe proposed amendment (Exhibit F) fine-tunes the legislation passed in 2017 \nand builds on the lessons we learned.  \n \nThe  Account  for  Family  Planning  in  the  State  General  Fund  is  created  in \nsection 1 of the bill. Per the proposed amendment, we added the word \"all\" in \nsection 1, subsection 2, paragraph (a) line 9 and again in subsection 5, line 16. \nThis clarifies when grantees are applying for grants, they need to consider those \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 4 \n \nwho would have difficulty obtaining family planning services, reinforcing the \nnondiscrimination protections in the bill.  \n \nSection 1, subsection 2, paragraph (b), of the proposed amendment provides \nclarifying language ensuring funds are used to pay for community health nurses, \nparticularly in rural Nevada. The State cannot grant money to itself, but our \ncommunity health nurses are those who provide this health care in rural Nevada \nand they work for the State. \n \nSection  1,  subsection  3  of  the  proposed  amendment  adds  language  stating \ngrant money can be requested by the Advisory Committee on Immunization \nPractices  to  fund  required  vaccinations  recommended  by  the  United  States \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention (CDC). \n \nThis does not require anyone to have additional immunizations or be immunized \nif they choose not to. This grant can be used to pay for immunizations if their \nhealth care provider recommends them in the course of education. This grant \ncan also be used for maintaining the ability to someday start a family. \n \nThe proposed amendment deletes section 1, subsection 8; language that was \nbased on the idea of nondiscrimination. We are leaving the language in the bill in \na way that allows the State Administrator to give preference for one type of \ncontraception over another. A benefit of having State control is long-acting, \nreversible contraception, for example, if a particular population has a specific \nneed for that. This amendment clarifies the Administrator can give preference to \ncertain contraception over others when awarding grant money in response to \nspecific needs, as long as the contraceptive methods meet the criteria currently \noutlined in statute. \n \nSection  1,  paragraph  (d)  of  the  proposed  amendment  proposes  a  new \nsubsection to add language ensuring the State is not discriminating against any \nspecific family planning provider. Other states have tried to exclude this. In this \ncase, it will not exclude Planned Parenthood health centers from getting family \nplanning money simply because they offer abortion care outside of these grants. \nThere are so few family planning providers in our State and we cannot afford to \nexclude  any.  This  will  strengthen  the  nondiscrimination  in  the  State  grant \nprogram.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 5 \n \nPlanned  Parenthood  believes  this  amendment  should  state  that  the  State \nAdministrator cannot discriminate against a provider of family planning services \nbecause the provider offers any legal medical service, not because the provider \noffers family planning service. In 2017, we were very careful to distinguish \nwhen  we  were  talking  about  family  planning.  We  are  talking  about \ncontraception, we are not talking in code about abortion, and nothing in this bill \nwould change that approach. This is a family planning grant program; this is its \nintention. Nothing changes the covered age and it is still a list of methods the \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) have approved for contraception. \n \nFinally, section 2, subsection 1 of the proposed amendment proposes to add an \nadditional section to reduce the amount of the appropriation from $12 million to \n$6  million  over  the  biennium,  which  reflects  the  change  the  Governor  has \nallocated. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSenate Bill 94 directs the money into the account for family planning, which \nwas a piece that even though in the last Session we created an account for \nfamily planning and there was a $1 million allocation, those two dots were \nnever connected. This bill cleans this up and ensures this new allocation goes \ninto the account for family planning.  \n \nThis bill clarifies that money can also be spent on community health nurses in \nrural Nevada since they are the primary providers there. The State was not \nallowed to grant money to itself. This will allow for those community health \nnurses to perform the services paid by the grant. \n \nThis bill will align the appropriation request to what is in the Governor's budget.  \n \nThe amendment adds the word \"all\" to reinforce and strengthen discriminatory \npractices if you need these family planning services. When people qualify, they \ncan  achieve  those  services  regardless  of  their  gender,  and  without  any \ndiscriminatory language.  \n \nIn  the  amendment,  we  also  include  immunizations  ensuring  there  is  no \ndiscrimination against any specific type of provider providing any legal medical \nservice. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 6 \n \nMS. CAFFERATA: \nI would add that I am learning more about the State budget and the funds to \nwhich they are applied. We are in a conversation with the Department of Health \nand Human Services (DHHS) to ensure the money goes to the appropriate fund \nand accomplishes the right goal. There may be additional fine-tuning needed, \nbut that is the intention of the bill. \n \nKATHLEEN TEIPNER (Planned Parenthood Mar Monte): \nThroughout  my  work  in  Nevada  in  the  health  care  nonprofit  sector  as  the \nAssociate Vice President of External Affairs for Nevada Planned Parenthood Mar \nMonte, I have consistently heard from people throughout Nevada that they want \naccess  to  affordable,  quality  health  care,  including  reproductive  care. \nReproductive care is health care, and it has never been more important to invest \nin this care than it is today. With federal restrictions and taxes increasing, it is \nurgent  we  ensure  health  centers  serving  Nevada's  communities  are  able  to \nprovide that vital care at an affordable cost.  \n \nPlanned Parenthood health centers in Nevada offer high quality, non-judgmental \nhealth care on a sliding fee scale. Our staff members mirror the diversity of the \ncommunities they serve. Together, the Mar Monte and Rocky Mountain affiliates \nrun three health centers, one in northern Nevada and two in Southern Nevada. \nIn total, they provide over 17,000 patients each year with access to preventive \nhealth  care,  cancer  screenings,  sexually  transmitted  infection  testing  and \neducational programs.  \n \nLast  Session  the  Legislature  created  a  State  grant  program  and  budgeted \n$1 million to fund it. As Nevada Associate Vice President, I see the impact of \nthis grant every day. Our Reno health center used this specific grant to hire the \nhealthcare staff they needed to keep their doors open five days a week. This \nallowed them to see 36 percent more patients than without the grant. They saw \n81.5 percent women, and 18.5 percent men. Almost 40 percent of the patients \nthey saw fell below the poverty level. Fifty-three percent were self-pay as they \neither did not have insurance or did not qualify for Medicaid. The center in Reno \nis just one of the  health center providers that received this family planning \ngrant. Grant funds were also used to expand the services available in Clark \nCounty, Washoe County and rural Nevada.  \n \nBy  funding  $6  million  over  the  biennium  through  the  State  funded  family \nplanning grant, Nevada is making sure the most vulnerable patients in our State \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 7 \n \nreceive the care they need. Nevada is fortunate to be led by Governor Sisolak \nwho believes in increasing access to health care. During his State of the State \naddress in January, he demonstrated his commitment to reproductive health \ncare in Nevada when he announced he had included $6 million in his budget for \nfamily  planning.  We  are  appreciative  of  the  Governor  and  the  Legislators' \ncommitment to healthy women and families. This bill is an important step for \nthe health of our State and we encourage you to pass S.B. 94. \n \nHEIDI PARKER (Executive Director, Immunize Nevada): \nImmunize Nevada supports S.B. 94 and Senator Ratti's submitted amendment \nas immunizations are an integral part of family planning. Experts advise being \nup-to-date on all recommended vaccines before becoming pregnant as this helps \nboth protect the mom and baby from a number of diseases causing serious \nconsequences during pregnancy.  \n \nThe  CDC  has  guidelines  for  vaccines  needed  before,  during,  and  after \npregnancy. Many of these vaccines are routinely administered during childhood \nand  their  protection  is  carried  through  adulthood.  For  example,  the  human \npapillomavirus (HPV) vaccine helps avoid the need for procedures on the cervix \nbecause of abnormalities and cancers caused by HPV. It can help decrease the \nproportion  of  pregnancies  that  end  in  pre-term  birth  related  to  cervical \nincompetence during pregnancy.  \n \nIncluding vaccines under a family planning grant program would allow expanded \naccess to immunizations which is desperately needed in Nevada where we have \na continued shortage of providers and challenges with access to preventative \nhealth care. These challenges are especially prevalent in rural Nevada where \nresidents may not be eligible for federally funded vaccines and who struggle to \nfind care.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nOn page 3 of the bill, line 36, does the word \"any\" refer to the 13 items listed \nin the bill as those to which we are limited? Does it include Mifepristone, the \nchemical abortion drug (RU486), or just the 13 listed? \n \nMS. CAFFERATA: \nSection 1, subsection 3, paragraph (a) states, \"Money in the Account may only \nbe used to pay for: The provision of …\" and there begins the list of 18 approved \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 8 \n \nFDA methods of birth control, which does not include RU486. It only includes \nitems to be used as contraceptives. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nMy reason for asking is you have listed 13 and not 18 items. \n \nMS. CAFFERATA: \nWe have them listed slightly different from the FDA. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIs it just these 13 listed in the bill that are included in the \"any?\" \n \nMS. CAFFERATA: \nThis may be a question for your legal team. As we went through this several \ntimes last Session, it was these contraceptive devices and drugs as approved by \nthe FDA. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThere are some medicines approved by the FDA to be used for interruption of \npregnancy. Are you saying only these 13 of the 18 on this list are approved by \nthe FDA? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSenator Hardy, I understand the list of 18 you and I were able to get consensus \non last Session. We are going to need to get back to you and compare this list \nto the one from last Session. Our intent is for it to be as exact to the agreed \nupon list from last Session. \n \nMICHAEL  HACKETT  (Nevada  Primary  Care  Association;  Nevada  Public  Health \nAssociation): \nThe Nevada Public Health Association supports S.B. 94, as we did last Session \nin support of the family planning bill. The written testimony provided is specific \nto the Nevada Primary Care Association (Exhibit G). \n \nSKYYLAR JORDAN (Planned Parenthood): \nI am a 15 year-old volunteer with Planned Parenthood. I have been on birth \ncontrol for approximately a year and it has changed my life completely. Before \nbeing on the pill I was miserable, felt frequent pain, and missed time from \nschool and work. This hindered my education and disrupted my health and life \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 9 \n \nas a whole. Going to a local health center to see a doctor helped me achieve the \nstability I needed. Having access to safe, affordable care is a human necessity. \nEveryone deserves the type of access I have. \n \nJAZZ SHEFFER: \nWhen I was 21 years old, my mother was employed in a job where I had \nbenefits under her insurance. I was able to seek long-acting, reversible birth \ncontrol. The private clinic I went to in Las Vegas informed me it would cost \n$500 to receive an intrauterine device (IUD). I visited Planned Parenthood and \nthey provided the IUD for closer to $50 with my insurance coverage. This birth \ncontrol will last five years before it must be removed. At 26, I will no longer be \ncovered under my mother's insurance. Please support S.B. 94 so I may continue \nto have access to the reproductive health care I need. \n \nJANINE HANSEN (Nevada Families for Freedom): \nNevada Families for Freedom is concerned about any tax dollars going to fund \nPlanned Parenthood in any way. In Las Vegas they offer services for abortion \nreferral, RU486, and in-clinic abortion procedures.  \n \nSection  1,  subsection  8,  page  3,  attempts  to  avoid  discriminating  against \nPlanned Parenthood. The new subsection in the amendment replaces subsection \n8 discriminating against any provider in any other manner. We disagree to any \nsupport  going  to  Planned  Parenthood,  whether  for  contraceptives  or \ncontraceptive procedures promoted, or paid for by taxpayers in the State. \n \nMs.  Cafferata  identified  the  definition  of  family  planning  as  not  including \nRU486, abortion or abortion referrals. We are opposed to these taxpayer dollars \ngoing to fund Planned Parenthood. It is almost impossible for these things to be \nseparated.  \n \nWe encourage you to allow the State to discriminate in the way that it provides \nfunds, and not to support organizations that promote not only abortion, but \noppose parental education and consent. \n \nLYNN CHAPMAN (Nevada Families Eagle Forum): \nThe American Center for Law and Justice stated the Sixth Circuit Court of \nAppeals had an 11 to 6 decision, ruling states can choose to cut funding to \nPlanned  Parenthood.  An  amicus  brief  was  filed  supporting  state's  rights  to \ndefund Planned Parenthood and any abortion providers, and choose to direct the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 10 \n \nfunds to actual family planning services. It overturned the lower court's decision \nwhich had blocked the State of Ohio from defunding Planned Parenthood. The \noverwhelming majority of the appellate court agreed the state had no obligation \nto fund the abortion industry. \n \nHow much do we spend on sex education? Currently, we pay for feminine \nproducts; how much is spent on that? Now taxpayers are going to be asked to \nfund other people's sex lives. This is asking too much of the taxpayer. We need \nto start teaching responsibility.  \n \nDON NELSON (Pro-Life League of Nevada): \nPro-Life  League  of  Nevada  believes  S.B.  94  should  be  abortion  neutral  by \nexcluding abortion as a method of family planning and excluding any funds \ngoing to counseling for, or referral to abortion.  \n \nAlthough the CDC and the Health and Human Services Office of Population \nAffairs does not include abortion in their definition, it is regarded as a method of \nfamily planning by abortion advocates and other areas of law and policy.  \n \nThe Mexico City policy denies funding to foreign organizations that \"perform or \nactively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other Nations.\" The \nmeaning of family planning includes abortion to these groups and is indicated by \nPlanned  Parenthood's  refusal  to  agree  to  this  provision  and  enable  them  to \nreceive these funds.  \n \nAbortion as a method of family planning is also seen in the abortion industry's \nopposition to the policy on these grounds. Senate Bill 94 needs to be abortion \nneutral by excluding abortion as a method of family planning. Drugs such as \nulipristal, an emergency contraceptive closely related to RU486, should also be \nexcluded. \n \nJOELLE GUTMAN (Washoe County Health District): \nThe Washoe County Health District has provided Title X funded family planning \nservices for over 40 years and understands the important positive impact these \nservices provide to our community. The health benefits and positive economic \nimpact  of  being  able  to  plan  one's  family  are  numerous  and  include  higher \ngraduation  rates,  lower  use  of  State  and  federal  assistance  programs,  and \noverall better health outcomes.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 11 \n \nUnintended  pregnancy  remains  a  tremendous  social  and  economic  burden \nnationally  and  locally,  with  an  annual  cost  of  $9.4  billion  nationally.  It  is \nestimated that $68 million was spent on teen childbearing in Nevada. Overall, \nwomen  in  Nevada  have  reported  that  52  percent  of  pregnancies  were \nunplanned. Public spending totaled $103 million for unplanned pregnancies in \nNevada in 2010.  \n \nLocal health authorities are often the safety net for family planning services in \ntheir community, as is the case in Washoe County where we rely on Title X \nfunding. The health district's recent Title X funding grant awards were reduced, \nand Nevada's overall award was reduced by $140,000, making S.B. 94 much \nmore important. The Washoe County Health district supports S.B. 94. \n \nMARK CLEMMER: \nI oppose S.B.  94. The first line of the legislation, Nevada Revised Statutes \n(NRS) 442.725, creates an account for family planning in the State General \nFund. I feel those services can be covered under the Division of Welfare and \nSupportive  Services.  I  agree  with  the  comment  on  the  Sixth  Circuit  Court \nopinion. I oppose having abortion be created as a revenue.  \n \nI am opposed to making Nevada a sanctuary State. The $12 million for family \nplanning  does  not  include  any  funding  for  people  in  opposition  to  these \npositions. This violates my Constitutional rights for equal protection under the \nlaw. Males have no representation or say in any of these bills if they are paying \nchild support for either the mother or their child under 18. This excludes them \nfrom any participation. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 94 and open the hearing on S.B. 179.  \n \nSENATE BILL 179: Revises provisions relating to abortions. (BDR 40-567) \n \nSENATOR YVANNA D. CANCELA (Senatorial District No. 10): \nToday I have the privilege of bringing S.B. 179 before the Committee. I will \nspeak about the history bringing us to this point, the problem it aims to address, \nand review the conceptual amendment (Exhibit H) as I go through each section. \n \nAs we talk about the background of the bill and the foundation for women's \nreproductive  freedom  in  Nevada,  we  talk  about  years  1973  and  1990. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 12 \n \nRoe v. Wade was voted on in 1973 at the United States Supreme Court. Within \na year it was enacted into State law. It was passed in the 1973 Legislature \ncodifying Roe v. Wade protections. In part the preamble states: \n \nIt is the intent of the Legislature of Nevada to enact a statute that \nrecognizes the deep concern the people of Nevada have to protect \nthe health, well-being and welfare of each pregnant female and of \nthe  child  whereas  she  is  pregnant,  without  interfering  with  the \nConstitutional  rights  of  any  pregnant  woman,  or  any  person \nlicensed to practice medicine, surgery or obstetrics. \n \nIn  1990,  through  a  referendum  process,  the  Nevada  Campaign  For  Choice \nworked hard to get 10 percent of the vote from the previous election, ensuring \nthe measure would go to a vote of the people. Because it was a referendum and \nnot an initiative petition process, it enshrined that piece of statute into NRS. As \na result of the support of the Question 7 Nevada Abortion Statute Referendum, \nthe law under NRS 442.250 stands and cannot be modified or undone by the \nLegislature. In the 1990 general election, it was approved with 200,645 votes \nin  favor,  only  115,495  against  and  an  overwhelming  majority  of  Nevadans \ncodified those protections in our statute. \n \nThis  is  the  foundation  of  how  we  came  to  this  moment.  It  means  that  in \nNevada,  unlike  in  most  states,  should  Roe  v.  Wade  be  overturned  by  the \nSupreme Court, those protections will remain in statute. We need to ensure, as \na State, abortion procedures are medical procedures with the utmost medical \nprotection  surrounding  them.  There  should  be  nowhere  in  statute  where \nabortion procedures are criminalized; S.B. 179 aims to address this. \n \nSection 1 of the bill deals with a statute requiring a physician to obtain informed \nconsent. Today, there are provisions in statute requiring language that is not in \nline with medical standards. These revisions bring informed consent laws on \nabortion in line with proper medical standards of care.  \n \nThe conceptual amendment proposes section 2, subsection 1, paragraphs (a) \nand (b) of NRS 442.253 remain in the bill. This means the attending physician, \nor  other  qualified  office  person,  must  explain  to  the  patient  that,  in  their \nprofessional judgement, she is pregnant. This must be done in an accurate and \nthorough manner to be reasonably understood by the pregnant woman and a \ncopy of her pregnancy test should be available to her. The amendment proposes \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 13 \n \nthe confirmation of the gestational age of the fetus to be explained to the \npatient.  This  language  reflects  language  from  the  American  College  of \nObstetricians  and  Gynecologists  Committee  on  Obstetric  Practice.  The \ngestational age is included as it reflects medical language. \n \nThe next provision in S.B.179 deletes subsection 1, paragraph (c) in section 2 \nstriking out the provision that a physician must talk about the physical and \nemotional implications of having an abortion. It requires a physician only explain \norally the procedure, its associated discomfort and the risks, much like a doctor \nwould around any other medical procedure. It indicates, but does not mandate, \na physician to provide information about emotional side effects. They are not \nbarred from doing so, and it does not affect the ability of a physician to discuss \nthose side effects.  \n \nThe  American  Psychological  Association  (APA)  did  a  study  on  this  precise \nquestion and found there are no mental disorders or mental health repercussions \nassociated with abortion, any more than there are with a first term pregnancy. \nAlthough a person who undergoes repeated or multiple abortions could be found \nto have mental health issues, these would likely surround broader issues not \nnecessarily  tied  directly  to  the  abortion.  I  have  concerns  with  the  word \n\"emotional\" being in statute as it is not a direct mental health term. We want to \nensure all language surrounding an abortion is medically in line.  \n \nThe informed consent language in section 2 deals with the ability of a physician \nto obtain informed consent from a woman in language she understands. It is \nimportant  the  physician  receives  fully  informed  consent  when  a  woman  is \nmaking the personal and medical decision to undergo an abortion. This often \nmeans  a  translator  must  be  in  attendance  in  order  for  the  woman  to  fully \nunderstand the procedure and give informed consent. Senate Bill 179 provides \nfor this. \n \nSenate Bill 179 strikes language from three sections of NRS. The first section is \nNRS  201.120  which  deals  with  fetal  homicide  covered  in  NRS  200.210, \npunishable as a Class B felony. By removing this from NRS, we remove the \nability for this language to be used against a woman as a result of a miscarriage \nand then penalized for a very personal decision. Unfortunately, language such as \nthis has been stretched by prosecutors when women are in situations like a \nmiscarriage, in order to have test cases making their way to the Supreme Court \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 14 \n \ndealing with abortion rights. We want to ensure this language is not available in \nNevada statute. \n \nThe second section is NRS 201.130 which deals with the distribution of drugs \npotentially  leading  to  a  miscarriage,  such  as  the  RU486  drug,  which  is  an \nabortion pill. It would fall under the same informed consent standards as any \nother abortion procedure. The risk that this will lead to mass distribution of \nRU486 is a misnomer. \n \nFinally, NRS 201.140 deals with whether or not a person could be criminalized \nfor testifying as part of an abortion procedure. We want to ensure that we \ncover a woman undergoing an abortion is not penalized for testifying. \n \nIf this were a bill on any other subject but abortion, we would have an empty \nroom with only me testifying. Due to the nature of the bill, abortion is an issue \nwhich brings out a lot of sentiment. Look to the premise of the bill and not to a \nbroader discussion. This is about bringing a medical procedure and our statute in \nline with medical language, ensuring our informed consent laws are in line with \nmedical best practices. \n \nCAROLINE MELLO ROBERSON (State Director, NARAL Pro-Choice Nevada): \nI support S.B. 179 and will summarize with my written testimony (Exhibit I). \n \nThe decision to have an abortion should be respected as a deeply personal \ndecision; S.B. 179 affirms that right. You will hear testimony from the women \nwho came before us. I say we stand on the shoulders of giants, particularly \nwhen  it  comes  to  protecting  our  reproductive  freedom.  You  will  hear  from \nwomen who worked on the ballot measure in 1990 affirming that right.  \n \nThe content of this legislation is broadly supported by all Nevadans from all \ndifferent backgrounds. Removing criminal penalties for abortion has 66 percent \nsupport  among  Nevadans,  regardless  of  their  political  affiliation.  We  believe \nabortion is not a crime and should not be treated as such.  \n \nTwo things this legislation addresses are to clean up existing statutes updating \nour informed consent to 2019 medical standards, and ensuring the State has \nthe most accurate information when women are determining whether they want \nto terminate a pregnancy.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 15 \n \nLAURA FITZSIMMONS (Nevadans for Choice): \nThirty years ago, the United States Supreme Court issued a decision that stated \nstates should have more leeway in deciding what their citizens want to do about \nthe  issue  of  choice.  Sue  Wagner  called  women  together,  Republicans  and \nDemocrats alike, who spent a year discussing Question 7 at extreme personal \nand emotional cost. It passed by 62 percent of the vote.  \n \nAs  Senator  Cancela  stated,  the  word  abortion  is  generating  the  kind  of \ncontroversy we are seeing today. It is established that Nevada is a pro-choice \nState. The voters have spoken and this bill simply cleans up remnant laws from \nthe past. This bill cleans up antiquated words and ensures the views of the \nphysician do not interfere with a woman's rights to make her decision. \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nLanguage has been stricken from section 3, subsection 1. The word \"written\" \nwas stricken. If you are a physician and you are recording everything in the \npatient's record, if it is not \"written\" it is not done. If a physician has obtained \noral consent, and it is challenged, where is the safe harbor for that physician? \n \nSENATOR CANCELA: \nThe language does not prohibit written consent, rather, it changes it. This is the \nonly way to capture the different ways consent is given today, including an \nelectronic form of consent. It would not change the way in which a physician \nreceives consent. \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nTalking about language to be stricken, we have marital status. Given the laws \nand the way they are written, potential fathers require the opportunity to claim \ntheir fatherly right. If you take out the question of marital status, how does this \nimpact legal proceedings when someone else, for example the father has a legal \nright to the child? \n \nSENATOR CANCELLA: \nIt is not the physician's duty to inform a partner of a woman's decision. That \nconversation should be had between the two individuals who conceived and is \nnot medically pertinent information. Only medically pertinent information is to be \ncaptured. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 16 \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nWe want to ensure we are asking the question about marital status to make the \nwoman  think  about  the  consequences  she  is  undergoing.  It  may  not  be \nmedically relevant, but this is a very highly charged event that is happening in \nsomeone's life.  \n \nSENATOR CANCELLA: \nBecause  it  is  a  deeply  personal  decision  for  a  woman,  she  should  not  be \nburdened with any external pressures not medically related as she is making the \ndecision. The same kind of requirement is not put into statute in any other \nprocedure. A man is not asked if he is married when he requests a vasectomy; \nthere is no reason why it should be asked prior to a woman requesting an \nabortion. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nYou referenced NRS 201.110, 201.120 etc., but your conceptual amendment \nonly speaks to NRS 201.150, the misdemeanor concealing of birth. Did you \nmean to include all the other sections? \n \nSENATOR CANCELLA: \nThe  amendment  continues  to  repeal  certain  sections  with  the  exception  of \nNRS 201.150,  which  would  remain  in  statute.  NRS  201.120,  201.130  and \n201.140 are repealed. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI am confused as to what stays in the bill and what is repealed. \n \nSENATOR CANCELA: \nEverything  related  to  parental  notification,  NRS  442.255,  442.2555  and \n442.268, will stay in statute. The intent of the conceptual amendment is to \naddress informed consent and outdated laws that punish abortion.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIf  a  woman  is  under  age  18,  unmarried,  and  unemancipated,  does  parental \nnotification stay in statute? Does it change the court authorizations or parental \nnotifications? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 17 \n \nSENATOR CANCELA: \nThe bill does nothing to change the status quo on parental notification. That \nwas struck down by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nSection  1,  paragraphs  (b)  and  (c)  of  NRS  442.250  speaks  to  abortion \nprocedures before and after 24 weeks gestation. We know right now it is at \n19 weeks for resuscitation if they are born. Is this meant to stay at 19 weeks \ninstead of the traditional 24 weeks? \n \nSENATOR CANCELA: \nThe bill does not address that section of statute and does not change anything \nabout the way abortion procedures are currently done in the State. \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nWe are striking the first sentence in section 2, subsection 2. If we are trying to \nensure  we  are  obtaining  the  best  medical  information,  who  is  the  person \nallowed to gather the information in place of an attending physician? \n \nSENATOR CANCELA: \nSenate Bill 94 will not change the way any doctor's office currently operates \nwhen a nurse practitioner could obtain consent. It does not change the way \ninformed consent is gathered. It is intended to tighten the language around \ninformed  consent.  We  have  letters  of  support  from  both  the  Society  for \nMaternal-Fetal  Medicine  and  the  American  College  of  Obstetricians  and \nGynecologists.  We  have  medical  practitioners  here  today  who  can  possibly \nspeak more to how that plays out on a day-to-day basis.  \n \nThe intent is to tightly bring our informed consent laws on abortion in line with \nthe laws that exist elsewhere in statute. \n \nCATHERINE O'MARA (Executive Director, Nevada State Medical Association): \nThe Nevada State Medical Association supports S.B. 179 as amended and with \nthe  conceptual  amendment  Exhibit  H.  In  1994,  the  Nevada  State  Medical \nAssociation passed a resolution supporting the right for physicians to include \npregnancy termination as part of their practice. That would condemn any illegal, \nphysical and mental harassment and intimidation directed at such physicians.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 18 \n \nThe American Medical Association Code of Medical Ethics does not prohibit a \nphysician from performing an abortion in accordance with good medical practice \nand under the circumstances, which do not violate law. We look to the law and \nthe Code of Medical Ethics when determining how to proceed.  \n \nTo Senator Hammond's comment on whether written consent is required, it is \nnot. Under the Code of Medical Ethics it must be documented, either in the \nmedical record or the patient may sign a written informed consent. In that case, \nwe put the informed consent into the medical record. The patient is not required \nto sign it in every case. \n \nIn section 2, subsection 1, paragraph (c) of S.B. 179, the requirement for a \nphysician to describe physical and emotional implications of having an abortion \nis stricken. Physicians will use this law as a baseline and apply the standard of \ncare on top of that. The standard of care includes speaking with patients about \nemotions. We would oppose any kind of legislation restricting a physician from \nhaving accurate conversations with their patients. We do not see this bill as \nprohibiting a physician from discussing any type of emotion with their patients. \nWe would proceed in accordance with the law, the Code of Medical Ethics and \nthe standard of care. \n \nTOBY FRESCHOLTZ: \nI support S.B. 179, the Trust Nevada Woman Act. As a physician and surgeon, I \nhave the conversations around informed consent with my patients before every \nprocedure  I  perform.  This  legislation  ensures  that  medically  necessary \ninformation is reviewed between provider and patient, and updates informed \nconsent to current medical standards. It affirms the commitment of protecting \nand respecting reproductive freedom. \n \nMEGAN ORTIZ (American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada): \nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Nevada supports S.B. 179 with \nthe conceptual amendment, Exhibit H. \n \nRepealing sanctions on criminal penalties for abortions induced by drugs would \nensure no woman would have to be her own enemy. It does not deny the \nrightful criminalization of the act of unlawfully and surreptitiously drugging an \nindividual. That is battery at its most basic concept.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 19 \n \nThe ACLU of Nevada believes women should be allowed the option to look at \nwhat questions they can discuss with their practitioner, rather than having them \nforced upon them when it comes to emotions. \n \nRABBI SARA ZOBER: \nI support S.B. 179 and will read from my written testimony (Exhibit J). \n \nBEATRIZ URIBE: \nSeven years ago, I was in need of a mitral valve repair and had open heart \nsurgery. My cardiologist was unable to explain my procedures in Spanish, my \nfirst language. I tried to explain to my physician I needed someone to explain my \nprocedures in Spanish; he said it was not his problem. I support the necessity \nfor translators in a patient's primary language as it is important to our lives and \nsurvival. \n \nASHLEY BOWMAN (NARAL Pro-Choice Nevada): \nI am the Vice President of Community Outreach for the National Organization \nfor Women and represent NARAL which support S.B. 179. \n \nMy mother was raped at the age of 16 and had a child. She did not get an \nabortion because of the lack of access and provisions due to her age. There are \naspects of the bill that protect the human rights of women. We are headed in \nthe right direction updating and increasing communication between health care \nproviders and the patients receiving services. It provides interpreters so people \ncan understand the services they need, and takes away the inhumane, harsh \npunishment of women choosing to seek out the services of their choice.  \n \nMOLLY ROSE LEWIS (NARAL, Pro-Choice Nevada): \nI  represent  the  45,000  NARAL  members  across  the  State  in  support  of \nS.B. 179. With our female majority legislature, the first in the Country, this is a \nstep forward for women's rights as across the Country this is not happening.  \n \nI  would  also  like  to  mention  many  of  the  other  organizations  that  stand  in \nsupport of the bill, including Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada, the ACLU of \nNevada,  Nevada  Women's  Lobby,  the  Progressive  Leadership  Alliance  of \nNevada, Battleborn Progress, the Transgender Allies Group, Indivisible Northern \nNevada, the Libertarian Party of Nevada and the Human Services Network.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 20 \n \nJEAN MELBY-MAUER (Paradise Las Vegas Indivisible): \nThe  300  members  of  Paradise  Las  Vegas  Indivisible  located  in  Paradise \nTownship in Henderson, Nevada, support S.B. 179, decriminalizing abortion and \nupdating consent to 21st Century medical procedures.  \n \nAs  a  former  English  Language  Learner  specialist,  adding  the  provision  for \ntranslation for those who do not speak English is essential.  \n \nLINDA GALLANT: \nAs a long-time resident and woman, I feel privileged to live in a State where we \nhave laws to protect us. I support S.B. 179 and the changes made as a clean-up \nto the original bill. \n \nMR. NELSON: \nPro-Life League of Nevada opposes S.B. 179. This bill removes the provision \nthat  informed  consent  for  an  abortion  has  been  given  freely  and  without \ncoercion. This provision is not antiquated as there is no procedure that kills a \nhuman being.  \n \nThe Lozier Institute says the best estimates indicate somewhere between 30 to \n60 percent of all women seeking abortions in the United States do so under \npressure.  \n \nDue to the number of coerced abortions and the life changing consequences for \nmany aborting women, as well as many women who say they have regretted \ntheir  abortions,  the  provision  needs  to  be  retained  to  protect  women  from \nfurther victimization. This is necessary in Nevada with our parental notification \nstatute being enjoined.  \n \nPro-Life  League  opposes  eliminating  the  provision  removing  penalties  with \nregard  to  selling  or  giving  away  \"any  instrument,  drug,  medicine  or  other \nsubstance to produce miscarriage.\" Nevada has a very weak unborn victims of \nviolence act which penalizes people harming the unborn in an attack on the \nmother with up to 10 years in jail and a $10,000 fine. This only applies to a \n\"quick child\", the time when motion is felt by the mother. A person could slip \nan abortion drug into an unsuspecting pregnant mother's drink. It would seem \nprior to quickening, there would be no penalty. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 21 \n \nMELISSA CLEMENT (Nevada Right to Life): \nSenate Bill 179 improves a bad bill; unfortunately, not enough for Nevada Right \nto Life to support it. There are 3 major goals in this bill: first, weaken the \ninformed  consent,  second,  decriminalize  abortion  and  third,  update  laws  to \nerase parental notification from NRS. \n \nSection 1 of this bill eliminates the requirement that a physician certify consent \nin writing, and replaces it with obtains the informed consent. This appears to \ntransfer the burden from the physician, who has the knowledge and is generally \nobjective, to the woman who may not know what to ask and is in crisis. A form \nis referenced, but not exhibited in the bill questioning who creates this form. \nThe information it should contain needs to be consistent. \n \nSection 1 also eliminates the requirement for physicians to certify in writing, the \nwoman's marital status and age. Statistics are imperative to policymaking. They \nprovide insight into trends identifying problems, and lead to solutions.  \n \nFriday  I  received  current  statistics  from  the  Office  of  Analytics  of  the \nDepartment  of  Health  and  Human  Services.  The  slow  walking  of  abortion \ntrends,  as  well  as  the  proposed  removal  of  age  verification  in  this  bill,  is \ntroubling. In 2017, there were 14 abortions performed on minor girls under the \nage of 15. Our mandatory provider abortion report was instituted due to the \nnumber of children receiving an abortion at 12 to 14 years of age, or perhaps \nyounger, and is a warning sign of abuse.  \n \nTRACY MUSCARI: \nAs  a  physician  and  a  mother,  I  oppose  S.B.  179.  Section  1  removes  the \ncoercion requirement. Autonomy to make your own decisions without being \ncoerced  into  decision-making  is  important  for  a  woman  or  young  lady  to \ndetermine  their  own  course  of  treatment.  Not  assessing  for  coercion  is  to \nfurther  victimize  them,  to  force  the  decision  possibly  coerced  by  human \ntraffickers, rapists, boyfriends or parents.  \n \nA woman should be able to make her own decision and not have her parents \npush her into a decision they chose. Abortion is not a typical procedure, nor is \nassisted suicide a typical procedure. Asking the person not be coerced into that \ndecision is key.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 22 \n \nDEBORAH EARL (Vice President, Power2Parent): \nSenate  Bill  179  strikes  the  language  found  in  section  2,  paragraph  (c), \nexplaining the physical and emotional implications of having the abortion. Our \nfamily has dealt extensively with breast cancer, which includes the removal of \none or both breasts. Caring surgeons explain the procedure and the risks, and \nimportantly, the physical and emotional implications of the removal of a breast. \nBest medical practice and standards should include the physical and emotional \nimplications of having an abortion, as women need the information to make \ninformed decisions about their bodies. \n \nKATHLEEN MILLER (Nevada Right to Life): \nI am a marriage and family therapist, and have counseled men and women who \nhave been affected by abortion.  \n \nSenator Cancela's statement that the APA states there are no mental health \neffects from abortion is a misstatement, both by the APA and those who quote \nit.  I  have  researched  Dr.  David  Reardon  regarding  mental  health  issues  for \nabortion, as well as what I have seen first-hand. We tend to have confirmation \nbias on both sides. Those who do not think there are mental health problems \nwith abortion are going to read the same data differently than those of us who \nbelieve there are. There are many areas where we can come to an agreement, \nboth for us to be more open-minded in terms of what the mental health effects \nare and ensure it is included in the informed consent.  \n \nI have counseled women who have been institutionalized as a result of their \nabortion. Perhaps they had previous mental health issues, but those have been \ncontrolled,  in  different  studies,  such  as  the  Fergusson  Study  out  of \nChristchurch, New Zealand. This study was instigated by a gentleman who did \nnot believe there were mental health issues and set out to prove the reports we \nhad were incorrect.  \n \nCounseling can be done before performing an abortion so providers can look for \nrisk factors ensuring a woman is not at a higher risk of mental health disorders \nas a result of an abortion. \n \nMARIA CASSIDY: \nUninformed  decisions  are  always  bad  decisions.  I  am  here  as  a  mother  of \nteenagers and oppose S.B. 179. My children would not come to me if they were \non the road to abortion. They would see a doctor who I would expect to ask \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 23 \n \nquestions ensuring they are making the right decision. No one can tell me there \nare no emotional consequences from abortion; I am testimony to that.  \n \nELLIE STANKUS: \nI  oppose  S.B.  179.  James  Wilson,  a  United  States  Supreme  Court  Justice \nappointed  by  George  Washington,  once  said,  \"Human  law  must  rest  its \nauthority, ultimately, upon the authority of the law which is divine.\" \n \nWhy should we in the United States condemn the practice of child brides in \nanother nation that deems it proper? Why can I stand before you today and tell \nyou with absolute certainty that to continue to allow the slaughter of nearly \n3,500 unborn children every day in this nation is to propagate the highest form \nof murder? Because there is an authority greater than I who says, \"You shall not \nmurder.\" \n \nIt is currently illegal in 20 states to impose capital punishment on the most \nheinous criminals and yet, in these very states, a mother can look her newborn \nchild in the eye and say, \"you do not deserve to live,\" and the child will be \nmade comfortable as a doctor administers a lethal injection. In five, maybe ten \nor twenty years, an underage child will be able to go to a Planned Parenthood \noffice with a three-year-old on her hip and come out alone. \n \nBecause we have determined that a life was only valuable if it was wanted, or \nthat it was only sacred once it could fend for itself, we determined a mother \nwho no longer wants to feed, clothe or nurture her toddler has the right to end \nits life. \n \nRomans, Chapter 13, tells us God has appointed our leaders, and He calls them \nto uphold justice. It is with the highest respect and the greatest urgency, I ask \nyou to fight legalized infanticide in Nevada. The blood of millions of innocents is \nin our hands, but God, in His mercy, would hear the groaning of the contrite \nhearts which yearn to restore justice in this Nation. \n \nNICK EMERY (Executive Director, Friends of Life Choices Community Pregnancy \nClinic): \nI am a community leader in Carson City, an advocate and Pastor, serving as the \nExecutive Director of Friends of Life Choices Community Pregnancy Clinic in \nCarson City. I fight every day for the rights of women and families. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 24 \n \nI am grateful for the amendments to S.B. 179, but we must vote no. Women \nwill  always  need  to  be  given  accurate  information  regarding  any  medical \nprocedure.  To  be  informed  with  accurate  information  about  physical  and \nemotional consequences regarding an abortion, empowers women and families \nso an informed decision can be made, demonstrating we trust Nevada women.  \n \nLife Choices saw over 400 first-time clients in 2018 for pregnancy tests and \nultrasounds. Over and over again they share with us, not only how serious and \nimmediate the physical issues regarding abortion are, but the emotional and \npsychological aspects of abortion which are serious and long-lasting.  \n \nPost-abortion stress is real. Women report to us that even hearing the sound of \na vacuum after an abortion can bring on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) \nfor them. Post-abortion women have a higher risk of drug and alcohol abuse. \nWe want to empower them at their moment of choice to understand this, along \nwith PTSD, suicide attempts, clinical depression and anxiety. \n \nWe must trust Nevada women through strong written laws, correcting anything \noutdated  and  antiquated.  We  must  empower  women  to  make  an  informed \ndecision. \n \nKEITH SHONNARD: \nI am a practicing physician and radiologist in Carson City and volunteer at the \nLife Choices Community Pregnancy Clinic. Many young women come to the \ncenter seeking information for an abortion. Some decide to carry and others \ndecide to have an abortion. The young women and their young families who \ndecide  to  carry  often  benefit  from  external  support  such,  as  a  forum  of \nparenting classes. We are now finding the young women who decide to abort \nmay later regret their decision and often find themselves isolated. Life Choices \noffers support groups for these young women so they do not feel isolated or \nostracized.  \n \nThe  informed  consent  provisions  currently  in  the  law,  or  in  the  proposed \nlegislation, should include the most comprehensive informed consent language \nincluding  the  physical  and  emotional  implications.  I  support  leaving  in  place \nsection 2, subsection 3, so women can make the most informed decision about \nabortion. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 25 \n \nERIN PHILLIPS (President, Power2Parent): \nI  am  the  President  of  Power2Parent  in  Nevada,  representing  thousands  of \nparents  throughout  the  State.  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Senator  for  the \namendment she proposed; it is a good start. I do not think many people realize \nthat  we  have  notification  requirements  on  the  books  that  are  not  being \nenforced.  \n \nPower2Parent  has  concerns  with  S.B.  179.  We  would  like  to  address \nNRS 201.120,  the  section  that  removes  the  penalty  for  abortive  drugs.  A \nwoman can be given an abortive drug and there will be no penalty. There should \nbe no external pressures for a deeply personal decision. However, it does allow \ncoercion and additional external pressures on a woman. We should trust Nevada \nwomen  to  make  these  decisions  for  themselves,  not  under  coercion  with  a \nphysician verifying there is no coercion. \n \nSenate Bill 179 removes the requirement to report the marital status and age of \nthe woman. If we do not know the age of the woman, how can we verify this is \nnot an underage young woman?  \n \nParental involvement still receives widespread bi-partisan support in Nevada. \nInstead  of  adding  information  to  a  bill  that  is  essentially  still  dangerous  for \nyoung  women,  the  Committee  should  adopt  an  amendment  requiring  an \nexpedited  judicial  bypass  for  a  parental  notification  section  allowing  us  to \naddress  the  sex-trafficking  problem  in  Nevada.  We  need  to  ensure  we  are \nprotecting young women in Nevada, which this bill does not do. \n \nJULIE SMITH-GAGEN, PH.D.: \nI am representing myself as a Professor in Public Health at the University of \nNevada, Reno. I would like to address some misleading statements with regard \nto  mandated  language  of  mental  health  being  addressed  by  the  provider, \nspecifically the family and marriage counselor. Anecdotal stories about abortion \ncausing mental harm is just that, a story, not the norm.  \n \nPeer-reviewed literature shows women  who receive abortions have no more \nmental health issues than those who go through normal pregnancies, or women \nin general. Peer review means the validity of the research has gone through \nmultiple review steps by people unknown to the scientists and have the skills to \nevaluate  the  science,  methodology  and  statistics.  This  research  strongly \nsuggests that women who have mental health issues after abortion are most \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 26 \n \nlikely  experiencing  them  due  to  preexisting  mental  health  or  other  issues. \nWomen having a specific risk factor is a private matter between herself and her \nphysician. \n \nI deal with statistics daily and the only time the reason to know both abortion \nand marital status together is judgement, harassment and discrimination. \n \nELAINE PATRELLO: \nMy first encounter with the issue of young women who needed counseling due \nto unwanted pregnancies was in the early 1970s when abortions were illegal. \nCounseling these young women took place in a Lutheran Church as part of their \nsocial justice ministry. Interns from the medical school from the University of \nMiami performed illegal abortions on the second floor of the church once a week \nin the evening hours. It was frightening to go to the church and help young \nwomen in trouble. They were helpless and frightened, their families and the \nfathers of the babies knew nothing of their plight. The need for healthy and safe \nabortions was a national emergency.  \n \nToday we are still facing the same issues; health and safety for young women \nin  need  of  counseling  and  help.  Our  society  has  made  progress,  but  much \nremains. Senate Bill 179 will be another step toward the goal of unfinished \nwork. \n \nJULIANNA LUCAS: \nI was raised in a Catholic family and very pro-life growing up. My education in \nscientific knowledge and research, as well as my experience working in health \ncare,  has  changed  my  views  on  reproductive  rights  and  abortion.  I  support \nS.B.179.  \n \nI currently work in St. Mary's emergency room as a medical scribe. Prior to this \nI worked at Willow Springs Rehabilitation and Healthcare Center in Reno. These \nexperiences have exposed me to the irrefutable need for access to abortion, \nfamily planning and other reproductive services.  \n \nIn the emergency room, on a daily basis, I provide documentation services of \nverbal  consent  and  conversations  between  a  provider  and  patient,  versus \nnon-consent. Dilation and evacuation, or abortion, is a medical service and our \nright, as women and Americans, to have access to this life-changing, and at \ntimes life-saving procedure.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 27 \n \nANDREW POH: \nI  have  two  primary  areas  of  concern  with  the  legislation  as  put  forward. \nPhysicians will no longer be required to ensure the woman gives her informed \nconsent  freely  and  without  coercion,  as  that  line  has  been  struck  from  the \nlanguage. Those such as boyfriends, pimps and sexual predators will like that \nthis line has been stricken. My second concern is physicians will no longer be \nrequired to explain the emotional implications of having an abortion.  \n \nThe Planned Parenthood website has an affirmation stating after an abortion a \nwoman may feel \"sadness, guilt or regret.\" If Planned Parenthood is willing to \nadmit this, physicians should be able to tell patients this is a possibility. A \nwoman will feel regret unless her conscience has been seered, or she has lost \nher moral compass. \n \nScientifically speaking, abortion is the taking of a human life; our conscience \ntells us this is wrong. Today, abortion has become a commodity, something we \ndo out of convenience. Convenience does not make something right. It is not \nright for us to promote abortion because it is convenient. \n \nDR. PETER FENWICK: \nI am a family physician and have young ladies as patients who have asked for \nabortions. My discussion with these young ladies includes getting rid of the \nword fetus and calling it a baby, the words abort and getting killed. Eight to \nnine of the young ladies I have counseled changed their minds and had their \nbabies. Not one came back and said they were unhappy. Many women who \nhave had an abortion do have post-abortion guilt and depression. \n \nA young lady I saw who was 18 years old, in the Air Force and wanted an \nabortion. She explained she would be asked to leave the service. She returned \n18 months later with her baby. Her boyfriend had left and her parents had let \nher down, but she was the happiest girl in the world. \n \nBOB RUSSO: \nI oppose S.B. 179. When my wife was 19 years old she gave birth to a baby \ngirl.  Having  just  arrived  from  the  United  Kingdom,  being  young  and  not \nparticularly wise, she got involved in a short-term relationship and got pregnant. \nFortunately, she was given enough information to make a clear and positive \ndecision to have the baby and give her up for adoption. After 27 years, my wife \nwas able to reach out and meet the young adult she had given up for adoption. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 28 \n \nShe had dedicated her life to serving other people. Looking back, my wife is \ngrateful she made the decision she did, to have her baby and give her up for \nadoption.  \n \nSadly, I have known several other women who were not as fortunate. Instead \nof choosing life, they chose abortion and many years later they still feel the \nregret and emotional pain of that decision.  \n \nI oppose this bill. It does not give the mother adequate information on the \nconsequences of an abortion decision, the potential physical pain involved and \nmost  definitely,  the  emotional  pain.  Without  this  understanding,  it  is  nearly \nimpossible for a young woman to envision the consequences of the decision \naffecting the rest of her life. There should be no coercion to encourage abortion. \n \nNICHOLE MASON: \nSenate Bill 179 is a dangerous bill that goes against the principles of what \nscience says is good for our society. Behavioral scientists say we need more \ndialogue to make good decisions. Children need parents to help them achieve \ntheir full potential. Parents have been scientifically proven over and again to be \nthe greatest influence in their children's lives. No matter the issue, the key to \nhelping a child is more parental involvement, not less. \n \nResearch from a behavioral scientist will give you the example of Lawnchair \nLarry. Lawnchair Larry took 42 weather balloons, filled them with helium and \nattached them to his lawn chair. It drifted across the Pacific Ocean and into Los \nAngeles Airport airspace. The reason this is significant to this hearing is what it \nrepresents to behavioral scientists, what people do  when they do  not have \nenough information about a topic. Lawnchair Larry made this decision between \nhimself, his girlfriend and another friend, who did not have expert information \non what would happen.  \n \nYou are putting patients in this position if you pass this bill. Even with the \namendment, it does not allow physicians to give full disclosure of the emotional \nimplications of their decision. Lawnchair Larry, I am sure, did not understand the \nemotional implications of drifting up to 16,000 feet.  \n \nScientists will tell you that adolescents do not have fully developed brains. Their \nprefrontal  cortex,  which  is  responsible  for  rational  decision-making,  is  not \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 29 \n \ndeveloped until their mid-twenties. They are incapable of making an informed \ndecision and need more information, not less, in order to make a decision. \n \nREBECCA RASMUSSEN (Research and Community Outreach, Power2Parent): \nEvery year the National Center on Sexual Exploitation publishes what is called \nthe Dirty Dozen List. It names 12 mainstream contributors to sexual exploitation \nin America. The companies named make positive changes in their policies to \nstop promoting sexploitation. This list is a powerful force for change in our \nCountry. In 2019, Nevada made history. Not only are we listed as one of the \nDirty Dozen, we are the only non-corporation on that list. We can all agree this \nis not something to be proud of.  \n \nSenate Bill 179 solidifies our well-earned placement on this list. What is the \nnumber one influence determining whether or not a child will succeed in life? It \nis the parent. I am the mother of adopted children. How grateful I am their \nyoung birth mothers had the support of their parents. With this support our birth \nmothers made informed choices regarding their pregnancies.  \n \nPerforming an abortion on a minor, without her parent's knowledge, puts her at \na disadvantage. A recent study polled just under 1,000 women with an abortion \npast. Nearly 74 percent reported being coerced into having an abortion. The \npeople who stand to benefit from this bill are the abortion clinics, the brothel \nowners, the pimps and the human traffickers. Power2Parent opposes S.B. 179. \n \nED BILLS (Calvary Chapel Lone Mountain): \nI oppose S.B. 179. The issue of abortion is a sad one. I respect the right of \nthose who choose to see it differently than I do. I am opposed to any law that \ninterferes with the natural order of parenting God grants all humans. Every one \nof you sitting on the panel more than likely had a father or a mother to guide \nand lead you through life's decisions. Maybe some of you have not, but those \nwho have, I wish you would think about who raised you and why you make \nyour decisions. It is the basic right of parents to guide and nurture their children. \nThis must not be circumvented. \n \nIn the name of compassion for women's rights which need to be protected and \nstrengthened, our society has abandoned complete compassion for the unborn. \nHow did we get to the point where we have to sacrifice one in the defense of \nthe  other?  We  are  human  beings.  God  gives  us  the  intellect  and  ability  to \nreason.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 30 \n \nMS. CHAPMAN: \nI am State Vice President of Nevada Eagle Forum and oppose S.B. 179. When \nwe purchase a house or car, or choose a college to attend, we want all of the \ninformation  we  can  gather  about  that  house,  car  or  college  to  make  good \ndecisions.  \n \nMaryland has a new bill, The Woman's Right to Know Act. The bill will require \nwomen seeking an abortion to be informed about alternatives and the procedure \nitself, including adverse effects.  \n \nAs the Supreme Court stated in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, what abortion \nlaws serve to protect is the woman's right to make the ultimate decision, not a \nright to be insulated from all other decisions in doing so. We have to remember \nthe abortion procedure is irreversible. The Supreme Court has previously and \nrepeatedly  recognized  abortion  as  inherently  different  from  other  medical \nprocedures, because no other procedure involves the purposeful termination of a \npotential life; this was Harris v. McCray in 1980. This is important to note as it \nhighlights the significance of ensuring women are fully informed about abortion \nprocedures and its consequences. Full and complete disclosure of all options \nand facts is what creates choice.  \n \nMS. HANSEN: \nI am the State President of the Nevada Families for Freedom and we oppose \nS.B.  179.  We  are  concerned  about  the  informed  consent  portion  being \ndiminished. How can someone make a true choice without accurate information \nregarding  the  consequences  of  abortion?  If  we  wanted  scientific  and \ntechnological information, we should be asking women to receive an ultrasound. \nThose are the real facts about what is going on when a woman is pregnant and \nwe are denying this. If we take out the information they should have the right to \nreceive on making a choice, it is because we do not want them to have the \nchoice.  \n \nI have a picture of a little girl who was almost a victim of abortion. Her mother \nand father were on drugs and the father was abusing the mother. By all rights \nand reasonable circumstances, she should have been a candidate for abortion. \nThank goodness she was brought up to have the information to be informed \nabout what was happening. To see the growth of the fetus, to know it was a \nreal baby and not something just named a fetus or a blob of tissue. Because she \nknew that, my granddaughter is here today. She made the right decision to give \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 31 \n \nher life and she is the delight of her mother, her new father and grandmother. \nMy daughter understood the real consequences of what an abortion would be \nand even in her dreadfully difficult circumstance, made the right choice.  \n \nMICHAEL DYER (Nevada Catholic Conference): \nI  am  speaking  in  my  capacity  with  the  Nevada  Catholic  Conference.  It  is \nimportant the language stay in the bill providing for parental notification and the \nbypass process if that is not practical. This language, initially going to be taken \nout, will remain. This language is what enables the parents to have input with \nthe  child.  One  of  the  tenants  of  the  Catholic  faith  is  that  parents  have  an \nobligation  to  interact  and  guide  their  children  when  they  are  young.  Put  in \nperspective, we are talking about people who are under 18 years of age.  \n \nAssembly Bill 139 before the Legislature this year is going to, if passed, change \nthe age of marriage for all people to 18, no exceptions. Notification to parents \nfor people under 18, with a bypass process to ensure no one is put in danger, is \nnot an unreasonable position. This language should be included in the bill. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL (A.B.) 139: Requires a person to be at least 18 years of age to \nmarry. (BDR 11-1) \n \nBEVERLY OZMID: \nI  oppose  S.B.  179.  I  sat  on  Attorney  General  Catherine  Cortez-Mastos' \ntrafficking group to help with trafficking legislation.  \n \nSenate Bill 179 is not decriminalizing abortion, which is legal in Nevada. This bill \ndecriminalizes criminally illegal abortion, which is dramatically on the rise. You \nare taking a medical, surgical procedure and replacing it with an unregulated \nblack hole for people to perform and administer abortion.  \n \nYou are doing this with the repeal of NRS 201.120 through NRS 201.150. Even \nthe Las Vegas criminal defense attorneys list the criteria to be prosecuted for \nillegal abortion. This will be blank when you repeal this bill. \n \nThis  is  a  physically  invasive  medical  procedure  requiring  anesthetic  and  the \ndispensing of drugs which cause pain and bleeding. There are people that title \nthemselves practitioners, whose names and locations are unknown, teaching \nthemselves  and  one  another.  They  have  no  schooling,  degrees,  training, \nrequirements, regulations, tests, licenses, standards, professional organization \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 32 \n \nor convention for updated information, State Board oversight, registration, fees \nor business or sales taxes.  \n \nCYRUS HOJJATY: \nThis  will  end  transparency  and  consent  so  the  medical  provider  does  not \ndisclose the emotional aspect of an abortion. Senate Bill 179 will decriminalize \nthe policies we have. There is human trafficking happening today and this will \nencourage the traffickers to commit a serious abortion. Drug lords will benefit \nfrom this as you can see in the border crisis we have today. NARAL is funded \nby  a  billionaire  who  has  funded  campaigns  in  the  Legislature.  Large \npharmaceutical companies are behind this. The National Council of La Raza has \nconnections with drug cartels and is an organization based on race. It wants \nopen borders and focuses on Latinos and feminism, which is what abortion is \nabout. It is connected to multiculturalism.  \n \nMS. CAFFERATA: \nThis bill does not reflect the entirety of all of our laws regarding health care \npractice. It goes into and fine-tunes our existing laws about medical practice, \ninformed consent and activities that are criminal.  \n \nAs the State Medical Association pointed out, under informed consent, abortion \nis  a  slightly  different  kind  of  medical  procedure  than  others.  It  has  some \nadditional  informed  consent  requirements.  Physicians  are  health  care \nprofessionals who are licensed in our State and use the standard of care to \nrespond to the needs of the patients providing them with the information they \nneed. Informed consent is a professional standard to which professionals will \nadhere.  \n \nThere has been discussion about people putting drugs in women's drinks and \nnot being prosecuted. We have criminal statutes in our State and putting drugs \nin people's food or drinks is an assault and illegal, regardless of whether we \nremove these antiquated criminalization statutes. Because the entirety of State \nlaw covers the concerns addressed here, this bill should go forward to protect \nwomen. \n \nLISA HUFFMAN: \nI support S.B. 179. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 33 \n \nMR. CLEMMER: \nI would ask the Legislators to strike some of the language from public testimony \nin reference to the word \"her\" being used continuously, and the antiquated \nlanguage. The United States and Nevada Constitutions are written in English, \nand are not antiquated. They also spoke to evidence of abortion as being true, \nthat is prejudice and discriminates against males, non-childbearing aged people \nand all others legally participating in the voting process.  \n \nThe proponents of this bill have received money from outside Nevada. It has \nbeen reported that a billionaire submitted $6 million and S.B. 179 proposes an \nadditional $6 million. Males, non-childbearing women and voters opposed to \nthese practices are not represented in the Legislature or this bill. \n \nJUANITA COX (Citizens in Action): \nI am the President of the Nevada Republican Assembly and represent Citizens in \nAction  today.  I  helped  put  Question  7,  the  Nevada  Abortion  Statute \nReferendum, through in 1990 because of antiquated laws. I have broadened my \nview  on  abortion  and  believe  it  is  becoming  too  easy  for  people.  You  are \nlessening  things  that  should  be  helpful  for  a  person,  sometimes  victims  in \nmaking a decision.  \n \nParental notification remains in the bill; however, we should not weaken the \nlaws around informed consent. Physicians should continue to obtain consent.  \n \nBARBARA JONES: \nI appreciate any changes made, but because this involves abortion I stand in \nopposition to S.B. 179. The woman behind Roe v. Wade has changed her mind \nand has been speaking for the pro-life movement around the Country.  \n \nThere is a movie entitled \"Unplanned\" coming out this week based on the story \nof a woman involved in Planned Parenthood. She had five abortions and has \nsince changed her views on abortion. It was redemptive for her and changed her \nlife. \n \nGAIL STRUBLE: \nWhen our younger daughter joined our family at age six, she was happy to wrap \na birthday present for her older sister. Even at this young age she showed \nstrong musical ability. She sang a song she made up when she wrapped that \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 34 \n \npresent showing she was happy to be in the world. Please speak up for the \nchildren. \n \nAPRIL ZAMPIRRO: \nI  am  currently  eight  months  pregnant.  It  would  be  a  great  opportunity  for \ninformed consent to include an ultrasound or fetal heart rate monitor. I am \namazed by what I see each time I go for an ultrasound and the information \ncontained  in  the  ultrasound.  The  heart  begins  to  beat  at  21  days  after \nconception. Often, a pregnant woman does not know she is pregnant before the \nheart is beating. \n \nSENATOR CANCELA: \nThis is an important bill for anyone who engages in the process, regardless of \nwhat side they are on.  \n \nI would ask the Committee to ensure decisions on this bill are made based on \nscience and data. Unfortunately, there is a bulk of literature on the topic of \nabortion that has been debunked as anecdotal, and should not be given the \nsame weight as evidence from something such as the American Psychological \nAssociation  (APA).  This  evidence  is  peer-reviewed  and  the  APA  has  done \nextensive work to ensure definitive evidence on the question of mental health \nand abortion in particular.  \n \nOne overarching argument we heard today was about coercion. Certainly that is \na concern for all physicians regardless of procedure. The second is around the \nstandard of care which leads to physicians ensuring patients are at a procedure \nvoluntarily. The patient's bill of rights, which is enshrined in Nevada statute in \nNRS 449A, specifically speaks to the question of coercion, ensuring the patient \nhas the right to speak to a physician and is not coerced into a procedure. The \nAmerican  Medical  Association  (AMA)  has  language  speaking  directly  to  this \nquestion. Their ethics code in chapter two summarizes what we have in Nevada \nstatute,  where  a  physician  must  assess  the  patient's  ability  to  understand \nrelevant medical information and the implications of treatment alternatives to \nmake an independent voluntary decision.  \n \nRemoving coercion from the language surrounding abortion procedures does not \nremove the ability for physicians to continue to follow the patient's bill of rights, \nthe AMA guidelines or standard of practice. All of this remains in place. The bill \ndoes remove vague and outdated language which puts a burden on physicians \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 35 \n \nto achieve a standard they may or may not be able to properly assess. We \nshould default to their standard of care as opposed to an arbitrary word in \nstatute. \n \nAn abortion is a personal decision a woman makes and should be able to make \nfreely with medical information. Physicians are in no way prevented from giving \nthat  information  today.  The  difference  is,  today  a  physician  must  discuss \nemotional repercussions before a procedure. Emotional is neither a medical term \nof art nor a mental health term of art. The bill allows physicians to follow the \nstandard of care without prescribing to a term that is not encapsulated in mental \nhealth practice.  \n \nThe  APA  study  cites  the  most  rigorous  studies  indicated  within  the  United \nStates. The relative risk of mental health problems among adult women who \nhave a single, legal, first term abortion of an unwanted pregnancy, is no greater \nthan the risk among women who deliver an unwanted pregnancy. That is not to \nsay  women  will  not  undergo  a  roller  coaster  of  emotions  following  this \nprocedure. There is no specific mental health condition that can be pointed to as \na result of the procedure. It is because abortions are personal decisions and all \ninformation given to a patient needs to be based on science.  \n  \nThese laws have not been used to prosecute a woman today or since their \nenactment  in  1911.  It  is  important  these  laws  not  be  exploited  and  it  is \nimportant to remove them from law. Behaviors such as a man putting a drug in \na woman's drink as a way to induce a miscarriage is punishable under our fetal \nhomicide code. There is no reason to have this language tied to an abortion \nprocedure. \n \nSenate  Bill  179  cleans  up  the  language  to  ensure  informed  consent  around \nabortion is in line with medical standards which already have additional tenants \nof informed consent. It does no more and no less. It does not change the ability \nfor a woman to access an abortion, and does not change the standards around \nabortion.  It  allows  for  physicians  to  give  correct  medical  information  in \nextracting informed consent from a woman. That is important, not only for us \ntoday, but for generations to come. \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nSection 3, subsection 1, the words \"written\" and \"of the woman\" are struck \nfrom the language. Can you describe how the woman will actually be the one \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 36 \n \ngiving consent orally or written? I want to ensure we are not allowing someone \nelse to give consent, perhaps a parent or boyfriend.  \n \nSENATOR CANCELA:  \nAgain, the \"written\" strike-out is not to delete the ability for a physician to gain \nwritten consent; they can use a written form. This change allows for electronic \nmeans of obtaining consent. Many offices use an iPad which is still written, \nthough not on paper. Written may seem to indicate this.  \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nThe woman still needs to add her signature somewhere. \n \nSENATOR CANCELA:  \nThere is a signature required which is part of the patient rights language in \nNRS 449A that speaks to a broader informed consent. This allows for the form \nto also be kept in electronic form. The intent is to have the informed consent of \nthe patient. No one else would be able to give that informed consent. \n \nSENTOR HAMMOND: \nWhy strike out \"of the woman?\" \n \nSENATOR CANCELA: \nI will check with legal. The thought behind striking \"of the woman\" language \nwas because it was superfluous based on the rest of the language in statute \nwhere it refers to a woman throughout.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nPhysicians use scientific terms for the abortion procedure. Those terms include \ndilation and evacuation, vacuum curettage and other euphemistic words. It is \nimportant  for  a  physician  to  express  the  consequences  and  risks  of  the \nprocedure to the patient, including emotional feelings. \n \nI do not find the definition of woman in statute. I have heard a woman is \nsomeone who has entered into puberty. What age do you consider a woman, \none who is in puberty or reached a certain age? How are you determining at \nwhat  age  the  notification  for  parental  consent  must  be  obtained?  Does  the \nwoman's age come into play or the gestational age of the fetus? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 37 \n \nSENATOR CANCELA: \nThe bill does not address anything related to parental notification. What is in \nstatute today will stay in statute.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nHow are you determining who will receive the abortion, and at what gestational \nage for a woman who has requested an abortion? \n \nSENATOR CANCELA: \nSenate  Bill  179  does  not  address  what  is  permissive  today  around  when  a \nwoman can or cannot get an abortion. It does not address whether a woman \nmust discuss with her parents, or any other person involved, about whether or \nnot she will get an abortion. The bill only speaks to what happens when a \nwoman has made the decision to seek an abortion and what information her \nphysician should provide to her during the consultation regarding the procedure. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nWe have heard testimony about consequences to a woman having an abortion \nand happy testimony from those who decided against it. Before Roe v. Wade \nthere were abortions. The problem was many of them were not performed in \nsanitary and sterile locations, often only for those who could not afford to go to \na physician for the procedure. Those with money left the country for an abortion \nor paid someone to do the procedure.  \n \nSenate Bill 179 does not address the 11 year old; it clarifies language. There are \nmany times when we will have an opportunity in this body to do the right thing \nfor children. We will have several opportunities before this Session is over to \nvote on equal pay for the mothers of these children who are now born and will \nneed to feed and clothe them. The Southern Nevada Health District stated, \nmore likely than not single parents, particularly women, are making less than \ntheir male counterparts, and this is putting a tremendous burden on them as \nparents. We will have an opportunity to talk about how much we respect life \nwhen we start talking about paid family leave, about whether or not to pass \nlegislation for affordable child care and for a living wage. \n \nIt does not stop the abortion process. It takes it underground and makes it \nunsafe. Whatever your definition of poor is, poor women are the ones who are \ndying and will die. In Ireland, they tried the same thing. It is very restrictive and \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 38 \n \nit did not stop anything. Women are still doing what they think is necessary and \nputting their lives at risk.  \n \nThere was a five year experiment about children who are born to women who \nhave been denied an abortion. This study compared the health, development, \nmaternal bonding and poverty of 182 children; 146 children were born after \ndenial of abortion. Higher proportions of children born after denial of abortion \nexperience  poor  maternal  bonding  and  live  in  subjective  poverty.  The  study \nfindings suggest access to abortion enables women to choose to have children \nat a time when they have more financial and emotional resources to devote to \ntheir children.  \n \nWhat happens to these children once they are born? Why do we argue about \npaying for breakfast after the bill? About not paying public school teachers, \nputting money aside for affordable housing or making sure we have enough \nmoney in Medicaid so we can continue to expand the Affordable Care Act? All \nof those things are relevant to children once they are born. We do not have \nthose conversations; maybe we should. \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nDr. Nathanson, one of the original drivers of NARAL, stated we cannot put the \nhorse back in the barn. He has since changed his mind on abortion, realizes it is \nout there and there is nothing we can do about it. He said science is on the side \nof those who want to prevent abortion. If you take an ultrasound and you listen \nto it, you will understand a baby is a baby at a very early time in pregnancy.  \n \nI am not  suggesting we  put the genie  back in the bottle,  as he said.  It is \nimportant  we  talk  about  what  will  happen  during  this  Legislative  Session.  I \napplaud those who say we need to do something. My wife and I are adoptive \nparents and respect those who make the decision to adopt. The mothers who \nhave to make the tough decision to put up their children for adoption are the \nheroes here. \n \nWe should be strengthening this decision. There is no better health and human \nservices division than the family unit; people who make choices every day to \nhelp a child. It is important to discuss this, and we have listened to both sides \nand created amendments to the bill. There will be those who do not believe we \nhave gone far enough in the amendment process. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 39 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nMy challenge with this hearing is the lack of focus on what is actually in the bill, \nversus what is not in the bill. I appreciate the work Senator Cancela did in \nadvance of this hearing, bringing forward a narrowly focused bill that does a \ncouple of things. It is important when we get to work session that we are \nfocused on what is actually in the amended version of the bill, which is quite \nreasonable.  \n \nThe legalization of abortion is not up for debate, it is the law in Nevada. There is \nnothing in this bill that changes the law regarding parental consent. Nothing \nchanges who can and cannot get a legal abortion at this time. This bill does a \nnice  job  of  tightening  up  consent  to  ensure  it  aligns  with  current  medical \npractice. We are not putting nonmedical terms about a medical procedure in the \nlaw, and that is appropriate.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 179 and take public comment. \n \nMR. HOJJATY: \nI have seen many foreign workers cleaning hotels. Nearly all were speaking \nTagalog. Why is it we have so many foreign-born non-English speaking workers \ncleaning cafés? It is not the case in the Silver Nugget Hotel in Las Vegas. Are \nthey filling a gap or is it corporations wanting to have a lower wage labor force? \nThese people do not speak English, schools are overcrowded and many of our \nneighborhoods look like a third world country. Many wire money across the \nworld.  \n \nMELISSA CLEMENT: \nThis was an extremely fair hearing and I appreciate a well-run meeting. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe  Committee  has  received  letters  of  support  from  Progressive  Leadership \nAlliance  of  Nevada  (Exhibit  K),  Transgender  Allies  Group  (Exhibit  L),  Mylan \nHawkins (Exhibit M), Lawyering for Reproductive Justice (Exhibit N), the Society \nfor  Maternal-Fetal  Medicine  (Exhibit  O),  Joy  Viselli  (Exhibit  P)  and  Mary  W. \nRichardson (Exhibit Q). \n \nWe also received one letter of opposition from Jessi Bridges (Exhibit R). \n   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 40 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSeeing no further comment we are adjourned at 7:04 p.m. \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nVickie Polzien, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2019 \nPage 41 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nExhibit / \nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \n# of pages \n  A  1    Agenda \n  B  30    Attendance Roster \nElisa Cafferata / Planned \nS.B.94  C  4  Background Information \nParenthood Votes Nevada \nElisa Cafferata / Planned  Family Planning in Nevada \nS.B. 94  D  1 \nParenthood Votes Nevada  Graphic \nElisa Cafferata / Planned \nS.B. 94  E  4  Testimony of Support \nParenthood Votes Nevada \nS.B. 94  F  1  Senator Julia Ratti  Proposed Amendment \nMichael Hackett / Nevada \nS.B. 94  G  2  Testimony of Support \nPrimary Care Association \nS.B. 179  H  1  Senator Yvanna Cancela  Conceptual Amendment \nCaroline Mello Roberson / \nS.B. 179  I  3  Testimony of Support \nNARAL Pro Choice Nevada \nS.B. 179  J  1  Rabbi Sara Zober  Testimony of Support \nProgressive Leadership \nS.B. 179  K  1  Testimony in Support \nAlliance of Nevada \nS.B. 179  L  1  Transgender Allies Group  Letter of Support \nS.B. 179  M  1  Mylan B Hawkins  Testimony of Support \nLawyering for Reproductive \nS.B. 179  N  2  Letter of Support \nJustice \nSociety for Maternal-Fetal \nS.B. 179  O  2  Letter of Support \nMedicine \nS.B. 179  P  2  Joy Viselli  Testimony of Support \nS.B. 179  Q  3  Mary W.

It authorizes certain licensed professionals \nto administer or recommend the use of certain marijuana and industrial hemp \nproducts. It prohibits certain medical practitioners from refusing to prescribe or \ndispense certain controlled substances to treat pain just because a patient uses \nmarijuana or another cannabinoid compound. It creates the Cannabis Control \nCommission, which is responsible for approving or denying applications for a \nlicense to operate certain marijuana establishments.  \n \nI want to note that I have a proposed amendment (Exhibit G) and those changes \nwill be discussed when I get to those sections.  \n \nIn  section  1  of  the  bill,  it  authorizes  \"a  provider  of  health  care,  massage \ntherapist,  nail  technologist,  reflexologist,  structural  integration  or  practitioner \nperson  who  provides  wellness  services\",  to  administer  a  marijuana-infused \nproduct or products that contain industrial hemp which is intended for use or \nconsumption by humans by means other than inhalation or oral ingestion to a \npatient or a client.  \n \nWILL ADLER (Silver State Government Relations): \nSenate  Bill  228  was  originally  structured  to  create  a  Cannabis  Control \nCommission. I knew the Governor was already planning to do this, so I worked \nwith Senator Spearman to redraft this bill. I will skip to the end of the bill \nbecause  the  language  in  section  4  which  consists  of  the  Cannabis  Control \nCommission has been deleted. I will talk about the new amendment, Exhibit G. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI want to make sure we are all on the same page. You are not reading from the \nbill as published. You are reading from the proposed amendment, Exhibit G, \ntitled S.B. 228 amendment, William Adler. Is that correct? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 20, 2019 \nPage 5 \n \nMR. ADLER: \nYes. In section 4 was the Cannabis Control Commission, which was essentially \nthe same as the Governor's Cannabis Control Board. The restructuring of the bill \nnow focuses on allowing certain licensed groups to apply cannabidiol (CBD) \nproducts to their patients.  \n \nIn section 1 of the bill, it mentions a provider of health care, massage therapist, \nnail technologist, reflexologist, structural integration practitioner or person who \nprovides a wellness service to administer a marijuana-infused product. These are \nsimilar  groups  who  have  patients  or  clients  who  request  they  apply \nCBD products either in a massage or nail therapy session. To be clear, they are \nnot providing the CBD product. The clients are bringing the products to them. \nThere is some inconsistency within the various governing boards in regard to \nwhat is or is not allowed to be applied. This bill hopes to clear that up.  \n \nThe new section 3 of the bill outlines similar concerns as it relates to veterinary \nmedicine. This would relate to administering CBD by veterinarians to animals. It \nis  essentially  the  same  language,  but  covers  a  dog  treat  or  topical  lotions \ncreated for animals. The veterinarian has permission, if the owner brings in the \nproduct, to apply it to the animal. Currently, this is a grey area because of the \nnew legalization of hemp products. They are now Schedule V pharmaceutical \ndrugs in Nevada. It is not clear whether veterinarians can apply them or not.  \n \nSenate  Bill  228  empowers  healthcare  and  veterinary  providers  to  apply \nsomething as long as the client brought it in to them. These providers are not \nallowed to distribute or sell marijuana products. The language in S.B. 228 will \nclear the way for the boards of these professions to adopt similar language of \nno-harm and allow them to apply these products.  \n \nIn addition, we did get another amendment from Joe Heck (Exhibit H) covering \nconcerns relating to scope of practice, but I believe I have covered them in this \namendment presentation.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWho provides \"wellness services?\"  \n \nMR. ADLER: \n\"Wellness services\" is defined in the Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 629.580. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 20, 2019 \nPage 6 \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nWe were told by the Legislative Counsel Bureau (LCB), \"wellness services\" is no \ndifferent than what is defined in NRS. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIt  looks  to  be  defined  in  section  2,  subsection  7  of  S.B.  228,  \"'wellness \nservices'\"  means  healing  arts  therapies  and  practices,  and  the  provision  of \nproducts,  that  are  based  on  the  following  complementary  health  treatment \napproaches and which are not otherwise prohibited by subsection 1.\" It goes on \nto list these approaches in letters (a) through (n). \n \nSENATOR HARDY:  \nIs there a \"wellness services\" board? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI am not sure we have the expertise in this room to answer your question. \nPerhaps we can ask legal.  \n \nI have a question if, for example, I bring in CBD to a massage therapist, is that \npractitioner prohibited from using anything else besides CBD or the soon to be \nagreed upon definition of industrial hemp?  \n \nMR. ADLER: \nIn the past, products such as lotions and oils were brought in and regularly \napplied.  Now,  people  are  bringing  in  CBD  and  practitioners  are  looking  for \nclarity,  specifically  for  marijuana  products.  The  legality  of  marijuana  and \nindustrial hemp causes issues to be raised in regard to permissions. \n  \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe will hear testimony in support. \n \nLISA FOSTER (Nevada Veterinary Medical Association): \nThe Nevada Veterinary Medical Association (NVMA) is in support of S.B. 228, \nespecially  with  the  proposed  amendment  from  Senator  Spearman,  which \nmentions veterinarians in section 3. \n \nSTACY HOSKING (Nevada Veterinary Medical Association):  \nI am here to discuss, from a veterinarian's point of view, the use of CBD and \ncannabidiol type products in our veterinary patients. My interest is assisting the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 20, 2019 \nPage 7 \n \npublic  safety  aspect.  There  is  a  lot  of  confusion  in  regard  to  the  use  of \nCBD containing  products  by  veterinarians  with  a  Drug  Enforcement \nAdministration license. There is reluctance by veterinarians to even discuss CBD \nas an addition to therapies for our veterinary patients.  \n \nMy concern is, by not having a way to legally and confidentially discuss this \nwith clients, we leave the research to the client. Our clients are left using the \ninternet to try to determine what is an appropriate product, dosage and possible \nside effects. Our job could be improved by having the ability to freely discuss \nCBD that is derived from industrial hemp products with our veterinary patient \nowners.  \n \nIn terms of the science, we have a lot of data on the safety, efficacy and \ntoxicity of CBD and other fido-cannabinoids in our animal patients. Much of the \nearly data was derived from human studies, where animal models were used for \nresearch prior to moving the study to humans. It has only been in recent years \nthat veterinary animal specific clinical trials have been completed. One study \nlooked  at  osteoarthritis  treatment  in  dogs  using  a  currently  available  hemp \nderived CBD product. In that study, over 85 percent of dogs treated with the \nhemp  derived  CBD  product  showed  an  improvement  in  their  mobility  with \narthritis and a decrease in their pain markers.  \n \nIn  terms  of  other  ongoing  studies,  there  are  studies  of  epilepsy,  pain \nmanagement and post-operative management. Other ongoing studies are looking \nat large animals such as horses, and food-producing animals such as cattle and \nchickens, in terms of potentially using CBD in those animals to reduce stress \nand improve their quality of life. \n \nIn summary, I am here on behalf of the NVMA to provide the scientific aspect of \nCBD.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nDoes  the  person  applying  the  CBD  oil  need  to  take  precautions  against \nexposure? \n \nMS. HOSKING: \nThe application of a CBD oil would depend on the type of species used. Most of \nthese products are delivered by mouth. They are drops of an oil that is added to \nthe dog or cat food. There are some topical products, but we do not have much \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 20, 2019 \nPage 8 \n \ninformation in regard to the absorption. Topical products that would have the \nlowest effect would be best given by mouth. As long as the people are using \nsafe handling, they should not be exposed by giving an oil in a professional \nsetting.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWould they need gloves?  \n  \nMS. HOSKING: \nI  have  never  seen  recommendations  to  wear  gloves  when  administering \nCBD products.  I  personally  have  never  worn  gloves  to  administer  a \nCBD product. I would not have concerns about my level of absorption.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI have concerns about exposure. I have read many studies, where some of these \nproducts may have tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and the massage therapist may \nnot know the product has it.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWill CBD help my dog who has anxiety when exposed to fireworks? \n \nMS. HOSKINGS: \nIn my experience, CBD is part of an overall wellness program for pets. It is used \nas an ancillary therapy. I do not recommend it as a first line therapy. As a \ncardiologist,  my  interests  are  in  a  geriatric  population  with  multiple  medical \nproblems, side effects from the medications they are on and muscle wasting. I \nuse CBD to improve their appetite and mobility. In terms of fireworks anxiety, it \nmay not be strong enough for that, but definitely worth a try.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI  just  received  an  answer  from  LCB  to  the  earlier  question  that  dealt  with \nNRS 629.580. The LCB is monitoring this meeting. Per LCB, there is no board \nfor \"wellness services\" and people can provide \"wellness services\" without a \nlicense. Since S.B. 228 has a cross-reference to NRS 629.580, the term would \nhave the same definition as in that section. The LCB goes on to say, if they \nwere  a  licensed  professional,  their  conduct  would  fall  within  the  scope  of \npractice of that profession and be governed by the board of that profession.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 20, 2019 \nPage 9 \n \nJENNIFER PEDIGO (Executive Director, Nevada State Board of Veterinary Medical \nExaminers): \nWe are in support of S.B. 228. We receive questions from practitioners whether \nthey can discuss this issue with their clients since they would like to. We feel \ndirecting clients to the internet is not the best solution. We feel this supports a \npublic protection aspect.  \n \nA'ESHA GOINS (Green Bridge Consulting Group): \nI  am  an  advocate  for  marijuana  and  I  am  also  in  the  marijuana  business.  I \nworked four years as a manager in one of the first dispensaries which opened in \n2014. During that time, many of our clients were in chronic pain. We found the \nuse  of  CBD  and  hemp-derived  products  helped  them  in  their  recovery  and \nallowed  them  to  walk  again.  They  could  stand  and  run;  things  they  never \nimagined possible prior to using these products. The \"wellness services\" can \ntake this to the next level.  \n \nI have a personal story. My father has diabetes and issues with his feet. He had \na pedicure. These products took all the inflammation from his foot and kept him \nfrom losing his foot. This is an example of the importance of having these \nproducts available.  \n \nSANDRA  ANDERSON  (Executive  Director,  Nevada  State  Board  of  Massage \nTherapy): \nMassage  therapists  are  asking  for  the  ability  to  topically  apply  marijuana \nproducts  to  their  clients.  Currently,  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human \nServices (DHHS) allows us to apply them to one client. We cannot get a card to \napply  topically  to  multiple  clients.  Our  licensees  are  approached  by  multiple \nclients requesting topically applied applications and I have to tell them they \ncannot do this. This bill will allow them to topically apply products that their \nclients bring them and ask to have them applied.  \n \nWe are in favor of the bill; however, we also have concerns about exposure. \nThere is no science how this will affect the therapist long-term. The American \nMedical Association has concerns for the licensees who are topically applying \nsix  to  eight  clients  a  day.  Would  these  licensees  be  impacted  by  continual \nexposure to these products? We do not have enough science on that. I tell \nlicensees they should wear gloves, especially the ones with multiple clients.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 20, 2019 \nPage 10 \n \nI would like to address NRS 629.580. It was adopted several sessions ago to \nallow individuals to practice different types of wellness modalities. This applies \nto  some  of  those  modalities  and  some  not.  These  other  modalities  are  not \npermitted to do massage. If all we were looking at is topical application, it \nwould be massage. The wellness people defined in NRS 629.580 really would \nnot be included in this. They have an exclusion for massage. They can do aroma \ntherapy,  reiki,  colonics,  and  all  the  other  wellness  services  listed.  Those \nwellness practitioners do not have a license to topically apply any products. \nOnly  the  massage  therapist,  reflexologist,  structural  integrationist  and \nparticipants in cosmetology licensing can topically apply products.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI have the same concerns about topical application, especially the oils, because \nit  affects  not  just  the  skin,  it  can  be  inhaled.  Some  of  these  products  are \nproduced in such a way that they do not list all the ingredients in them. If a \nclient bought it and gave it to me, I would not know what was in it. I am going \nto have some liability. I think there are issues with the variability, evaporation \nand application of these products. \n \nMS. ANDERSON:  \nThere are components of essential oils in cannabinoid products. Essential oils \nare volatile and evaporate into the air and can be inhaled. We cannot protect our \ntherapists  from  that.  We  do  see  massage  therapists,  who  are  exposed  to \nessential oils all day long, who develop toxic effects from them. I personally am \none of them. I had some liver issues because of too many essential oils in my \nprivate practice.  \n \nThe  other  components  in  the  essential  oils  are  nonvolatile  and  oxidize  and \nbecome rancid. The concern of the therapists is they do not know what they \nare putting their hands into. It is their discretion whether or not they are going \nto use the product and whether or not they will wear gloves. This gives them \nthe ability to make those decisions.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI:  \nI am confused why a massage therapist can provide topically to one person and \nnot multiple people. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 20, 2019 \nPage 11 \n \nMS. ANDERSON: \nThe DHHS has a public information officer, who came and spoke to the Nevada \nState  Board  of  Massage  Therapy.  We  have  her  PowerPoint  presentation \navailable  on  our  website.  Their  position  is  if  you  are  going  to  be  topically \napplying a controlled product, you have to come in, fill out paperwork and get a \ncard. You can only do that for one person. That is what DHHS has told us; \ntherefore, that is what we have to tell our licensees.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nCan a massage therapist fill out paperwork for ten people?  \n \nMS. ANDERSON: \nI am not sure. If you go to our website you can see all the citations in regard to \nthis issue. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI think we will follow up on this issue. \n \nIs anyone here in opposition? \n \nRYAN BLACK (City of Las Vegas): \nWe  have  proposed  an  amendment  (Exhibit  I)  that  addresses  the  sponsor's \nconcerns. The intent of the amendment is to remove marijuana-infused products \nand  limit  S.B.  228  to  hemp  and  CBD  products.  It  also  removes  \"wellness \nservices\" providers from the allowances provided in this bill.  \n \nWe are opposed to S.B. 228 because it would allow anyone to bring any sort of \nmarijuana-infused products to a provider. This bill does not require that the \nadministrator be trained, licensed, or certified to administer that product. It does \nnot specifically state that this is limited to medical marijuana patients with legal \nmarijuana products produced in Nevada. That means a person could purchase a \nproduct made in the black market and bring it to one of these locations and \nhave it administered by another person. This could place both the provider and \nthe  person  in  danger,  since  most  black  market  criminals  do  not  have  their \nproducts tested.  \n \nThis bill also exempts a provider from being prosecuted if a licensing board or \nagency finds wrongdoing, such as marijuana being stored inside the business. In \nother  licensing  categories  such  as  alcohol  or  pharmacies,  businesses  are \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 20, 2019 \nPage 12 \n \nrequired to have a license for these products to be kept onsite. Marijuana should \nnot  be  treated  any  different.  For  example,  if  a  massage  establishment  was \nfound to have alcohol onsite, they would have to be licensed for that.  \n \nIn  my  experience,  many  massage  locations  where  we  find  illegal  alcohol  or \ndrugs onsite are also engaged in other forms of illicit activity. These types of \nbusinesses  are  prime  targets  for  black  market  activities,  such  as  human \ntrafficking and prostitution. This bill as written could help those illegal operators \nexpand their activities in the State. It would further tie the hands of a licensing \nboard or agency that attempts to combat these operators. This is often left at \nthe local level and not the State level.  \n \nOur  last  concern  with  this  bill  is  the  term  \"wellness  provider\".  A  wellness \nprovider is not a person who is regulated, certified or trained. They just have to \noperate within the confines of NRS 629. We find a lot of illicit operations take \nplace within that confine. Our concerns are not with massage therapists or \ncosmetologists  who  are  regulated  by  a  board.  A  wellness  provider  is  not \nregulated. If we were to find an issue in one of these locations, this bill would \nstop the City of Las Vegas from being able to prosecute a wellness provider \nbecause of what it says in the bill. We are in touch with the sponsor and see a \ncouple of amendments. I am confident we can come to some sort of agreement.  \n \nJOE HECK (Nevada Osteopathic Medical Association):  \nWhile I checked in as opposed to S.B. 228, with the sponsor's amendment we \nwould  be  in  support.  I  provided  our  proposed  amendment,  Exhibit  H.  I  see \nMr. Adler's proposed amendment, Exhibit G, incorporates the changes we had \nrequested. Therefore, with the adoption of that amendment, we would be in \nsupport.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nCan we rescind your proposed amendment?  \n \nMR. HECK: \nYes. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDoes anyone want to testify neutral? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 20, 2019 \nPage 13 \n \nCATHERINE O'MARA (Nevada State Medical Association): \nWe are neutral on S.B. 228, but I encourage you to process it with Mr. Adler's \namendment.  \n \nLEO DROZDOFF (Western States Hemp): \nWestern States Hemp is here in a neutral position on S.B. 228. As part of last \nyear's farm bill, hemp is now a legal product at the federal and state level. Since \nhemp is a legal commodity, its derived products generally do not need special \nprotections and provisions for use. We are aware there are a couple of revisions \nin the works and we stand ready to work with the affected stakeholders on a \nrevision. Our intention is to make legal hemp products as available as possible \nwithout unnecessary restrictions. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThis is the same bill we had last Session. Since that time, I became aware of \npeople who have illnesses and cannot tolerate pain medication. In July, my \nsister went into stage four renal failure. She cannot tolerate ibuprofen and was \nin a lot of pain. I told her about my bottle of CBD oil that I use on my knees. \nShe used my CBD oil and it gave her some relief. I have talked to other people \nwho have arthritis and this works for them. I believe it is important, especially \nfor  geriatric  patients,  to  get  legal  relief  by  people  who  are  licensed, \nknowledgeable and able to provide that relief.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 20, 2019 \nPage 14 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSeeing no further business, I adjourn the hearing at 6:32 p.m. \n \n \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nMichelle Hamilton, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 20, 2019 \nPage 15 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nBill   Exhibit /  Witness / Entity  Description \n# of \npages \n  A  2    Agenda \n  B  8    Attendance Roster \nS.B. 165  C  4  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 194  D  10  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 198  E  4  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 235  F  6  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 228  G  19  Senator Spearman  Proposed Amendment \nS.B. 228  H  6  Joe Heck / Nevada  Proposed Amendment \nOsteopathic Medical \nAssociation \nS.B. 228  I  3  Ryan Black / City of Las  Proposed Amendment \nVegas \n ", "23": "\nMINUTES OF THE \nSENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n \nEightieth Session \nMarch 25, 2019 \n \nThe Senate Committee on Health and Human Services was called to order by \nChair Julia Ratti at 4:10 p.m. on Monday, March 25, 2019, in Room 2135 of \nthe  Legislative  Building,  Carson City,  Nevada.

There is one amendment, which before this bill goes through this \nCommittee and out of Finance, we will work through to see if it is necessary to \nadd additional language. The other amendments coming to my attention are \nalready covered in the bill as the bill is expanding, not limiting. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will entertain a motion on S.B. 115. \n \nSENATOR  WOODHOUSE  MOVED  TO  AMEND  AND  DO  PASS  AS \nAMENDED AND RE-REFER TO FINANCE S.B. 115. \n \n  SENATOR HARDY SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \n  THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the work session and open the hearing on S.B. 270. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2019 \nPage 5 \n \nSENATE BILL 270: Requires the Department of Health and Human Services to \nestablish  and  administer  the  Nevada  Crisis  Response  System. \n(BDR 38-792) \n \nSENATOR DALLAS HARRIS (Senate District No. 11): \nI am here to present S.B. 270 for your consideration. According to the United \nStates Department of Housing and Urban Development, there are more than \n7,000 Nevadans who are homeless. This includes approximately 170 families, \n725 veterans, 1,400 unaccompanied young adults between the ages of 18 and \n24, and 650 chronically homeless individuals. Clearly, homelessness affects a \ndiverse group of people, families, individuals, couples, children and seniors. In \nfact, during the 2016–2017 school year, an estimated 20,700 public school \nstudents in Nevada experienced homelessness. Nearly 500 of these children \nwere unsheltered, 2,300 spent time in shelters, 2,800 lived in hotels or motels, \nand 15,150 were in double-up living arrangements.  \n \nHomelessness is closely associated with Nevada's current housing crisis and \ncomes with a high cost to the individuals and families who experience it, their \ncommunities and the State as a whole. \n \nResearch  shows  communities  save  money  when  people  have  supportive \nhousing,  largely  because  homeless  individuals  are  more  likely  to  experience \nchronic medical conditions as a result of housing instability. Having access to \nsafe,  quality  and  affordable  housing  can  improve  both  physical  and  mental \nhealth  and  numerous  other  factors.  While  various  State  agencies,  local \ngovernments  and  nonprofit  organizations  have  taken  steps  to  address \nhomelessness in Nevada, more can be done.  \n \nSenate Bill 270 aims to better assist individuals experiencing a housing crisis.  \nThis includes those who are transient, at imminent risk of homelessness or \nhomeless.  The  goal  is  to  improve  collaboration  and  coordination  among  the \nmany  State,  local  and  nonprofit  agencies  already  working  to  address  this \nproblem. \n \nI would like to direct your attention to the proposed amendment (Exhibit F) \nbased on feedback from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). \nThe bill and proposed amendment require the DHHS to establish and administer \nthe  Nevada  Housing  Crisis  Response  System.  This  will  create  a  centralized \nsystem at the State level, better coordinating existing efforts to prevent and \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2019 \nPage 6 \n \nreduce homelessness. Through coordination and collaboration we will be helping \npeople  experiencing  a  housing  crisis  across  the  State.  The  Nevada  Housing \nCrisis Response System is required to coordinate with social service agencies, \nlocal  governments  and  nonprofit  organizations  to  identify,  assess,  refer  and \nconnect people in crisis to housing assistance and services. These may include \nemergency services, emergency shelters, interim or permanent housing.  \n \nThis bill defines persons in crisis as people who are transient, at imminent risk \nof homelessness or homeless. It requires the Nevada Housing Crisis Response \nSystem to operate a system assisting such individuals 24 hours per day, 7 days \nper week. In addition, the System must develop prevention assistant programs \nto prevent homelessness. It seeks to help people who need assistance, preserve \ntheir  current  housing,  identify  an  alternative  housing  arrangement  or  find \nimmediate housing arrangements for those whose current housing situation is \nnot safe. The System is further authorized to perform any actions that assist \npeople experiencing a housing crisis and help prevent or address homelessness \nin Nevada.  \n \nThe proposed amendment, Exhibit F, clarifies the DHHS may adopt necessary \nregulations  to  carry  out  the  provisions  of  this  bill.  This  may  require  certain \ncommunity agencies that accept funds from the DHHS to participate in the \nNevada Housing Crisis Response System.  \n \nFinally, the bill authorizes the Director of the DHHS to solicit, accept and expend \nany gifts, grants, contributions or other money to carry out the provisions of \nthis  bill.  Any  money  received  for  these  purposes  must  be  accounted  for \nseparately in the State's General Fund and does not revert to the General Fund \nat the end of the fiscal year.  \n \nPreventing and addressing homelessness requires leadership, collaboration and \ncoordination  among  State,  local  and  nonprofit  agencies.  It  requires  stronger \noutreach and engagement activities working together and exploring partnership \nopportunities.  By  creating  a  centralized  Nevada  Housing  Crisis  Response \nSystem, S.B. 270 will empower the State and its communities to maximize the \neffectiveness of existing programs, and enhance our response to people in a \nhousing crisis.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2019 \nPage 7 \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nYou are trying to find someone who can take responsibility and one who can \nfind the assistance that folks may need. Are you thinking about putting one \nperson in this position or do you see this taking more than one person? \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nI would like to leave flexibility for the DHHS to implement the bill. It is my \nunderstanding  they  currently  have  mechanisms  they  can  adapt  to  meet  the \nrequirements of the bill. I do not see one particular person taking this on. I \nconsider the DHHS to be the centralized location where people can go for all \nresources that exist in the State. It would be up to the DHHS to determine how \nmany more staff they may need in order to meet the requirements of the bill. It \nallows the DHHS to put forward regulations to implement the Nevada Housing \nCrisis Response System as long as it complies with what we are requesting of \nthem. \n \nJULIE  KOTCHEVAR  (Administrator,  Division  of  Public  and  Behavioral  Health, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nIt is not our intent to use or add additional State staff. There are Continuum of \nCare Programs operating throughout the State actually doing these activities. \nAfter reviewing the bill, our intent is to see how we can fund them to include \nproviding more services, not to create new systems. Other states have rates of \n40 percent reduction in homelessness at costs of approximately $2,200 per \nintervention. Seven thousand homeless times $2,200 will not be an inexpensive \nfiscal note. However, it has resulted in a reduction in communities in Georgia \nand Washington where they have seen a significant return on investment for \nthis funding.  \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nI would be interested in seeing how long they have been doing this and the data \nthey have collected on how effective it has been. \n \nMS. KOTCHEVAR: \nI will provide you with a report. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nYou said some of this will include persons who may be homeless due to some \ntype of violence. Is it possible to leverage some of the funds from victims of \ncompensation to help carry this out? Not only monetarily, but in terms of staff. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2019 \nPage 8 \n \nIt seems some of the services represented in the bill are being provided by \nDHHS and it would be a matter of including this in the portfolio. Not so much so \nthey are overloaded, but to better coordinate those activities. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nI would note under section 2, subsection 3, paragraph a, of the amendment, the \nSystem may perform any other action that \"assists persons in crisis\". It sounds \nas though people experiencing any type of violence would be included under \nthis. The intent would be to allow even private dollars to fund that population. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN:  \nWe passed legislation last Session that would allow the DHHS to seek grants. \nYou cannot project what a fiscal note may be. However, some of the programs \nalready  in  place  would  help  mitigate  some  of  the  circumstances  around \nwhatever fiscal note exists. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS:  \nSection 1, subsection 2 of the amendment states, \"Subject to available funding \nthe  Department  shall  establish  and  administer  the  Nevada  Housing  Crisis \nResponse System.\" This will allow them to start with sources currently in place. \nI am also asking them to report to us on the implementation of this bill and am \nlooking forward to receiving statistics on the success. \n \nRYAN BLACK (City of Las Vegas): \nThe City of Las Vegas is currently spearheading the homeless crisis in Clark \nCounty  seeking  to  improve  this  issue.  Often  overlooked  in  homelessness  is \nprevention, and this bill is directed toward prevention. The City of Las Vegas \nsupports S.B. 270. \n \nJENNIFER JEANS (Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada; Washoe Legal Services): \nStable housing is an issue affecting all clients in each of our practice areas. A \ncentral response system to address clients facing an emergency housing crisis \nwould be immensely helpful to clients and attorneys attempting to assist them \nin other matters. The Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada supports S.B. 270. \n \nJESSICA WISE: (Food Bank of Northern Nevada): \nThe Food Bank of Northern Nevada helps as many people as possible within this \npopulation to gain access to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program; \nfresh foods through the mobile pantry. It is important to provide services as \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2019 \nPage 9 \n \nquickly as possible for those who are under threat of becoming homeless or are \ncurrently homeless. The Food Bank of Northern Nevada supports S.B. 270. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nIn closing, this is something small we can do that will have a large impact on \nthis very persistent problem. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 270 and open the hearing on S.B. 258. \n \nSENATE  BILL  258:  Revises  provisions  relating  to  applied  behavior  analysis. \n(BDR 39-248) \n \nSENATOR HEIDI SEEVERS GANSERT (Senatorial District No.15): \nSenate Bill 258 is a follow-up bill to S.B. No. 286 of the 79th Session. This \nprevious  bill  created  a  new  board,  the  Board  of  Applied  Behavior  Analysis, \npreviously based in the Board of Psychological Examiners. It created a State \ncertified  behavioral  interventionist  as  there  were  not  enough  registered \nbehavioral  technicians  (RBTs).  Working  with  children  with  behavioral  issues \nrequires a National Certification for RBTs.  \n \nWe  also  required  background  checks  for  the  RBTs  and  the  State  certified \nbehavioral  interventionists.  We  found  the  number  of  RBTs  has  grown \nexponentially in the last two years. There were under 100 across the State and \nwe are now approaching 700. This bill removes the State certified behavioral \ninterventionists, replacing it with RBTs.  \n \nThe  Board  of  Applied  Behavior  Analysis  was  recently  created  and  staff \nappointed. We have not reached the point where they have created what this \nBoard will look like. Because the Board was recently created, the Division of \nAging and Disability Services was going to be working with them as it was an \nupstart Board. This bill transfers many of the responsibilities to the Board. It is \nnot ready to take on all of the responsibilities other boards have that have been \nestablished for some time, including research and investigation. Dr. MacAleese \ncan speak to working collaboratively with the Aging and Disabilities Division of \nthe Department of Health and Human Services. \n \nRegistered  behavioral  technicians  are  certified  and  go  through  a  background \ncheck at a national level. This language is not apparent today. Part of another \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2019 \nPage 10 \n \nbill I am sponsoring around background checks is a follow-up to S.B. No. 287 of \nthe 79th Session.  \n \nWe have been working with the Department of Public Safety, enabling us to \naccept a signed document to be used verifying someone met the standards for a \nbackground check, rather than duplicate the background check. If a RBT has a \nqualified  background  check  completed  within  six  months,  with  requirements \nsimilar to ours and has been signed off, this would meet what is required by \nNevada. \n \nThis bill determines whether the Board of Applied Behavior Analysis or Aging \nand Disabilities Services Division is responsible for certain duties. It eliminates \nthe State certified behavioral interventionists throughout the bill, and the area \nconcerning the background check. \n \nKEN MACALEESE (Public Policy Chair, Nevada Association of Behavioral Analysis): \nI  will  read  my  written  testimony  (Exhibit  G)  and  refer  to  the  proposed \namendment (Exhibit H) in support of S.B. 258. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWill licensed State certified behavioral interventionists be losing their license due \nto the position being removed from statute? \n \nSENATOR GANSERT: \nNo  one  has  that  license  at  this  time.  Right  now  we  have  approximately \n700 RBTs which is the level of care we were looking to provide. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThere is the proposed amendment, Exhibit H, titled \"Proposed Revisions/Friendly \nAmendments.\" Are you still working on language in this amendment and do you \nneed time to complete this language before a work session? \n \nSENATOR GANSERT: \nRight now you do not have the language for background checks, so I could not \nprovide an actual proposed amendment for this language change. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThere is already broad agreement on what we are seeing in this amendment and \nit is appropriate for a conceptual amendment. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2019 \nPage 11 \n \n \nSENATOR GANSERT: \nYes, that is accurate. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nCan you describe where you are headed with the background check? \n \nSENATOR GANSERT: \nCurrently, when someone gets a background check as a member of a nonprofit \norganization or is licensed with an association, the background check must be \nduplicated. We worked with the Department of Public Safety to come up with a \nway for this bill, and another bill, to accept acknowledgment that an individual \npassed a background check at a certain level. Number 5 of the amendment \nstates \"Alter Sec 18, 3 RBT Fingerprinting/Background Check\", Exhibit H, and \nwill allow someone applying for registration in Nevada as an RBT to provide a \nform  to  the  national  organization  stating  the  requirements  for  background \nchecks  have  been  met.  There  is  no  custody  issue;  they  are  not  taking  a \nbackground  check  and  passing  it  to  someone  else.  This  suffices  for  what \nNevada needs as a background check.  \n \nThis holds true due to the follow-up bill to S.B. No. 287 of the 79th Session. \nPerhaps we have volunteers who do background checks and they work for \nAmericor in the school system. If Americor has someone who has passed their \nbackground  check,  this  would  suffice,  as  long  as  it  was  done  in  the  last \nsix months. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nIn our last Committee meeting, we had questions about what happens when \nthere appears to be negligent behavior and someone's life is in jeopardy. Would \nthe background check, completed in the last six months, include any pending \ninvestigations or only completed investigations? \n \nSENATOR GANSERT: \nIt only includes whatever information is available at the time the background \ncheck is completed. If the background check is six months old and something \nhappened  within  that  six-month  period,  you  will  not  have  that  information \nunless you rerun the background check. This is a consistent issue. You can \nalways be chasing a background check as it is dynamic. Things change over \ntime.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2019 \nPage 12 \n \n \nWe contemplated going back to the redundancy. When people pay money to get \na background check they get frustrated if they have to repeat it. In this case, for \nthe RBTs this is a national organization where background checks are required in \norder to receive their certification. For Nevada, we are just registering them. The \nnational organization has taken on the burden of ensuring they meet certain \nrequirements to become an RBT, part of which is the background check.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 258. \n \nThe  Committee  has  received  a  proposed  amendment  to  S.B. 115  from  the \nSouthern Nevada Breastfeeding Coalition (Exhibit I). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRemainder of page intentionally left blank; signature pate to follow.   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2019 \nPage 13 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSeeing no further business we are adjourned at 4:51 p.m. \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nVickie Polzien, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2019 \nPage 14 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nExhibit / \nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \n# of pages \n  A  2    Agenda \n  B  4    Attendance Roster \nS.B. 18  C  5  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 33  D  4  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 115  E  3  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 270  F  2  Senator Dallas Harris  Proposed Amendment \nKen MacAleese / Nevada \nS.B. 258  G  1  Association of Behavioral  Testimony of Support \nAnalysis \nKen MacAleese / Nevada \nProposed Conceptual \nS.B. 258  H  3  Association of Behavioral \nAmendment \nAnalysis \nSouthern Nevada \nS.B. 115  I  2  Proposed Amendment \nBreastfeeding Coalition \n ", "24": "\nMINUTES OF THE  \nSENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n \nEightieth Session \nMarch 27, 2019 \n \n \nThe Senate Committee on Health and Human Services was called to order by \nChair Julia Ratti at 4:13 p.m. on Wednesday, March 27, 2019, in Room 2135 \nof  the  Legislative  Building,  Carson City,  Nevada.

PARKS (Senatorial District No. 7): \nSenate  Bill  284  seeks  to  make  recommendations  for  revisions  to  existing \nstatutes and regulations through the re-creation of an Advisory Task Force.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 27, 2019 \nPage 5 \n \nDuring the early years of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and \nacquired  immune  deficiency  syndrome  (AIDS)  epidemic,  states  including \nNevada, implemented HIV-specific criminal exposure laws. These laws imposed \ncriminal penalties on people living with HIV, who know of their HIV status and \nwho potentially expose others to HIV.  \n \nIn  1990,  the  Ryan  White  Comprehensive  AIDS  Resources  Emergency \n(CARE) Act provided states with funding for HIV/AIDS treatment and care and \nrequired every state receiving federal funds to certify that its criminal laws were \nadequate  to  prosecute  any  HIV-infected  individual  who  knowingly  exposed \nanother person to HIV. \n \nIn our legal system, criminalization of potential HIV exposure is largely a matter \nof state law and not federal legislation. An analysis by the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Justice found 67 laws had \nbeen enacted in 33 states, explicitly focused on persons living with HIV. The \nmajority  of  these  laws  were  passed  before  antiretroviral  therapies  were \ndeveloped that reduce the HIV transmission risk to zero. Currently, it is possible \nto be HIV positive and have no detectable presence of the virus.  \n \nAs a person who helped develop Nevada HIV/AIDS statutes and regulations in \nthe late 1980s and 1990s, this is an issue that I have wrestled with for the last \nthree  Legislative  Sessions.  Today,  an  informal  coalition  of  healthcare \nprofessionals across the State have been working to address this issue and \ndevelop recommendations for consideration by the Legislature.  \n \nSenate Bill 284 will create a task force of concerned individuals appointed by \nthe Governor to address both the criminalization and stigma surrounding HIV \nand AIDS. \n \nSince S.B. 284 was introduced, an amendment to the bill (Exhibit H) has been \nintroduced. The amendment revises the summary on S.B. 284. We would like it \nto reference the term \"modernization\" and not \"criminalization\" since the AIDS \nTask Force efforts will be directed toward statutes and regulations that deal \nwith the disease as it affects society today and not how it impacted society \nnearly 40 years ago. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 27, 2019 \nPage 6 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDo we have anyone to testify in support? \n \nBROOKE MAYLATH (President, Transgender Allies Group): \nWe are in support of S.B. 284. \n \nJENNIFER HOWELL (Washoe County Health District): \nWe are in support of S.B. 284 and have submitted support testimony (Exhibit I). \n \nBRIANA ESCAMILLA (Human Rights Campaign): \nWe are in support of S.B. 284 with the amendment. \n \nELISA CAFFERATA (Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada): \nWe are in support of S.B. 284. \n \nANDRÉ WADE (State Director, Silver State Equality): \nI have submitted written testimony (Exhibit J). We are in support of S.B. 284 \nwith the amendment. \n \nPENNY JAMES: \nI am in support of S.B. 284. I have submitted written testimony (Exhibit K). For \n24  years,  my  uncle  was  HIV  positive.  I  stayed  with  him  when  he  was \nhospitalized. After about six months in the hospital, a doctor looked him in the \neye and said, \"How did you get this?\" The doctor was perhaps 26 years old and \nlooked at my uncle with hatred in his eyes. The doctor told me to leave the \nroom. I left. He cut my uncle open. When I returned, my uncle was cut open \nand the doctor had just laid something over the wound. My uncle had a pile of \nblood under him and was in a lot of pain, but could not vocalize it. I feel he was \nmistreated because of the stigma attached to HIV.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 284 and open the hearing on S.B. 364.  \n \nSENATE BILL 364: Prohibits discrimination against and provides protection for \npersons  who  reside  in  or  receive  services  from  certain  facilities. \n(BDR 40-757) \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 27, 2019 \nPage 7 \n \nSENATOR PARKS: \nSenate Bill 364 makes revision to statutes prohibiting discrimination against and \nprovides protections for persons who reside in or receive services from certain \nhealthcare facilities. \n \nMS. MAYLATH: \nI  would  like  to  share  a  bit  of  my  personal  background  and  professional \nexperience (Exhibit L).  \n \nSenate Bill 364 proposes to add specific non-discrimination language to the \nlicensing  of  healthcare  facilities  in  Nevada.  My  examination  of  the  existing \nlicensing  chapter  reveals  comprehensive  language  already  exists  for  the \nlicensing of a psychiatric hospital, which means this Legislation already has \nNevada specific precedence.  \n \nFor years, lesbian,  gay, bisexual, transgender,  queer, questioning (LGBTQ+) \npatients have been met with aversion by many medical professionals.  \n \nSHERRIE SCAFFIDI (Director, Transgender Allies Group): \nI will read some stories of discrimination by medical professionals to members \nof our community, Exhibit L. You can read further details in the court case \nRumble  v.  Fairview  Health  Services  (Exhibit  M).  Because  of  this  treatment, \npatients are hesitant to seek medical help. \n \nMS. MAYLATH: \nPreviously in this Committee, we discussed a case about our friend Cassie, a \ntransgender woman who suffered from a gunshot wound, Exhibit L.  \n \nThis bill simply mandates that every person treated in a healthcare facility be \ntreated  with  dignity  and  respect,  in  a  manner  that  promotes  healing  and \ncomfort.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs there anyone in support of S.B. 364? \n \nMS. ESCAMILLA: \nWe are in support of S.B. 364. The Human Rights Campaign represents about \n15,000 members and supporters in Nevada. There are over 100,000 LGBTQ+ \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 27, 2019 \nPage 8 \n \npeople  in  Nevada.  They  should  not  fear  discrimination  when  they  seek \nhealthcare coverage.  \n \nMS. CAFFERATA:  \nI am here on behalf of Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada. Our health centers \nhave  nationally  undergone  an  initiative  to  make  sure  all  of  our  healthcare \nproviders  are  trained  how  to  deal  with  issues  of  cultural  competency, \nspecifically the health care that transgender people need. We support S.B. 364. \n \nMACKENZIE BAYSINGER (Human Services Network): \nWe support S.B. 364. \n \nCAROLINE MELLO ROBERSON (NARAL Pro-Choice Nevada): \nWe  are  in  support  of  S.B.  364.  We  are  an  organization  that  represents \n45,000 folks from all over Nevada who are battle born and feminist strong. That \nincludes all backgrounds as well as transgender.  \n \nSENATOR PARKS: \nSenate Bill 364 relates to the protection of vulnerable persons. It prohibits a \nmedical  facility  from  engaging  in  certain  discriminatory  actions  and  requires \nsuch facilities take measures to protect the privacy of persons receiving care \nfrom  these  facilities,  and  requires  administrators  and  employees  of  such \nfacilities to receive training.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 364 and open the hearing on S.B. 344. \n \n SENATE  BILL  344:  Revises  Medicaid  reimbursement  rates  related  to  family \nplanning services. (BDR 38-743) \n \nSENATOR MELANIE SCHEIBLE (Senatorial District No. 9): \nSenate Bill 344 provides when different facilities are providing the same family \nplanning care or procedures, they get reimbursed the same rate by Medicaid.  \n \nMS. CAFFERATA:  \nI  am  here  on  behalf  of  Planned  Parenthood  Votes  Nevada.  I  am  going  to \nhighlight my testimony (Exhibit N) and what we hope to accomplish. I know this \nCommittee has heard a great deal of testimony about the challenges Medicaid \nreimbursement rates present to all healthcare providers. What the Committee \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 27, 2019 \nPage 9 \n \nmight  not  know  is  different  healthcare  providers,  who  provide  the  same \nhealthcare service, get reimbursed under fee-for-service at different rates. For \nexample, if a nurse in her own practice does an extended new client visit, she \nwould be reimbursed at $48.47 per hour; whereas, the same nurse in a family \nplanning  clinic,  which  is  Type  17  Special  Clinics,  would  be  reimbursed  at \n$38.08 per hour. This example and other differences are outlined in (Exhibit O). \nThis  creates  quite  a  difference  in  the  amount  of  money  the  health  center \nreceives.  \n \nThis presents an issue for health centers throughout Nevada that are trying to \nprovide quality care in a sustainable way. The solution adopted by several states \nis to provide an enhanced rate for family planning providers.  \n \nMany women would rather go to a health center that provides family planning \nbecause they feel their concerns will be confidential. These women prefer a \nhealth center over a Federally Qualified Health Center, where they could be \nsurrounded by toddlers, seniors or dental patients. They just want to have their \nreproductive  healthcare  concerns  addressed.  This  bill  would  allow  the \nafore-mentioned health centers to see more patients in an efficient way, thereby \nincreasing access for women to get the care they need.  \n \nSenate Bill 344 requires Nevada to pay the nonfederal share of expenses to \nestablish the rates of reimbursement for family planning services provided on a \nfee-for-service  basis  by  a  clinic  that  specializes  in  providing  family  planning \nservices.  The  rate  would  be  equal  to,  or  greater  than,  the  rates  of \nreimbursement provided for such services provided on a fee-for-service basis by \nsuch a clinic on June 30, 2019, or 105 percent of reimbursement provided on \nthe current Medicare fee schedule for such services.  \n \nMost of the Medicaid population are served under managed care contracts and \nnot  fee-for-service.  Primarily  fee-for-service  programs  are  effective  in  rural \nNevada.  They  only  impact  special  populations  in  Washoe  County  and  Clark \nCounty.  The  last  time  I  looked  this  up,  there  were  17  specialty  clinics  in \nNevada. Three of the 17 specialty clinics are Planned Parenthood; however, \nPlanned Parenthood does not qualify for the fee-for-service reimbursement rate. \nEven though this bill will not assist Planned Parenthood, we support it because \nit increases access to health care. It helps community health nurses and basic \nhealthcare providers in rural Nevada.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 27, 2019 \nPage 10 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWho pays for the higher reimbursement rate? \n \nMS. CAFFERATA:  \nNevada would have to pay the nonfederal share to bring the reimbursement rate \nup to what is written in the bill. The rate would most likely be 105 percent of \nthe Medicare rate and would come out of the State Medicaid budget.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWhere is the fiscal note? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe have not received the fiscal note at this time. \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nYou mentioned that Planned Parenthood would not benefit from this. Is that \ncorrect? \n \nMS. CAFFERATA: \nPlanned Parenthood in Reno takes Medicaid, but it is through a managed care \norganization  contract.  Planned  Parenthood  does  not  currently  take \nfee-for-service.  \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nThis bill addresses an issue that only affects rural areas. Is that correct? \n \nMS. CAFFERATA: \nYes. We have testified about the lack of family planning in all of Nevada. This \nparticular bill will specifically benefit rural Nevada healthcare folks.  \n \nI want to follow-up on the question about costs. When we looked at a family \nplanning  waiver  to  expand  access  to  family  planning,  what  you  find  in  the \nMedicaid budget is you are actually saving money. You are allowing women to \nspace having children and have children when they want to have them. You \ncome out with a net savings. We believe this will represent a cost savings to \nNevada. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 27, 2019 \nPage 11 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDoes anyone want to testify in support of S.B. 344? \n \nMS. MELLO ROBERSON:  \nI am here on behalf of NARAL Pro-Choice Nevada, which is an organization \ndedicated to promoting the reproductive freedom for all Nevadans. That includes \nthe right to plan your own families and space your own pregnancies. This is an \nessential  service  and  improving  outcomes  is  a  priority,  especially  for  rural \nNevadans.  \n \nJOELLE GUTMAN (Washoe County Health District): \nWe are in support of S.B. 344. The health and positive impacts of being able to \nplan one's family are numerous, including higher graduation rates, lower use of \nState and federal assistance programs and overall better health outcomes. The \nGuttmacher Institute estimates for every $1 invested in family planning, the \ntaxpayer saves $7. Services provided by Title X family planning clinics alone \nyielded $5.3 billion in total savings for publicly funded family planning in 2010. \nIn Nevada, 20 percent of teen births were by teens who already had a child. \nIn 2010,  $60  million  was  spent  on  teen  childbearing  in  Nevada.  In  2010, \n52 percent  of  pregnancies  were  unintended,  costing  Nevada  $103  million. \nImproved reimbursement can increase care from family planning specialists for \nwomen who receive Medicaid.  \n \nMS. MAYLATH: \nOn  behalf  of  all  the  transgender  women  and  men  who  live  in  Nevada,  we \nsupport this bill, because family planning is just as important to the transgender \ncommunity as it is to all men and women.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nMy question is for Washoe County Health District. Tell me about rural health \nclinics in Washoe County where this would apply. Is there one in Gerlach? \n \nMS. GUTMAN: \nI am not aware of a health clinic in Gerlach. I represent the Washoe County \nHealth  District  and  we  provide  family  planning  services  for  all  of  Washoe \nCounty. Most of our clients are not fee-for-service. We are here in solidarity. \nMany  rural  residents  in  other  counties  who  do  not  have  access  to  family \nplanning services often have to get those services in Washoe County.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 27, 2019 \nPage 12 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nSo the rural county residents have to go to Reno? \n \nMS. GUTMAN: \nYes. \n \nMICHAEL HACKETT (Nevada Primary Care Association): \nI am here on behalf of the Nevada Primary Care Association. We want to be on \nthe record in support of S.B. 344. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDoes anyone want to testify neutral on S.B. 344? \n \nJOAN HALL (Nevada Rural Hospital Partners): \nWe are neutral; however, we agree with the concept of the bill. It does not help \nrural hospitals or their affiliated rural health clinics. The rural health clinics are \npaid a lump sum amount. This bill would help private providers in rural areas, of \nwhich we have few.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY:  \nAre we talking about places in the rural communities that are solely for family \nplanning? I am not aware that there are any. \n \nMS. HALL: \nIn the communities I represent there are not any. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nDo you represent 17 counties? \n \nMS. HALL: \nI represent 12 counties. \n \nSUZANNE BIERMAN (Administrator, Division of Health Care Financing and Policy, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nI want to note that these services are currently covered by Nevada Medicaid \nand a change in the reimbursement rate would require a change to the State \nplan which would require federal approval.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 27, 2019 \nPage 13 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe are ready for closing comments and can the Committee get more clarity of \nfee-for-service, which appears to be limited? Is there a concrete example of who \nthat would be? \n \nSENATOR SCHEIBLE: \nYou are correct, this bill does affect a small group of providers. We started by \nlooking at a larger problem and could not solve the problem with one bill. This \nbill carves out one section of providers who we could help with a legislative \nsolution.  \n \nMS. CAFFERATA:  \nAccording to the caseload of people who are served under the fee-for-service \nprogram in the Medicaid Office, there are 189,000 people in Nevada. I do not \nknow specifically where those folk reside. We will follow-up on this issue. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nOn this line of questioning, the Committee will work with Senator Scheible and \nthe Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to see if we can get \ngreater clarity as to where those 189,000 people are receiving their services.  \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nThese are just clinics that provide help on family planning; they do not perform \nabortions? \n \nMS. CAFFERATA: \nThere are existing prohibitions in Medicaid regulations, and there is an extremely \nlimited number of cases where the money could be used to cover an abortion. \nWe  are  not  talking  about  abortion  providers;  we  are  talking  about  breast \nexaminations, cancer screenings, birth control and things of that nature.  \n \nSENATOR SCHEIBLE: \nWhat we want to accomplish, especially for women in rural communities who \ncannot afford to go to their family doctor or nurse practitioner every time they \nneed to renew their birth control prescription, is a clinic where they can go to \ntalk to a nurse or doctor and get birth control. If those clinics cannot keep their \ndoors open, then they cannot afford to serve the people who depend on them \nmost.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 27, 2019 \nPage 14 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 344 and open the hearing on S.B. 362. \n \nSENATE BILL 362: Revises provisions concerning the placement of persons with \ndementia in a residential facility for groups. (BDR 40-611) \n \nSENATOR JOSEPH P. HARDY (Senatorial District No. 12): \nSenate Bill 362 comes from a medical observation that if a person has mild \ndementia, they do not have to be locked up.  \n \nHELEN FOLEY (Center for Assisted Living): \nIn  September  of  this  last  year,  a  technical  bulletin  was  issued  by  Dr.  Julie \nKotchevar, Administrator for the Division of Public and Behavioral Health. The \nbulletin outlined when an individual who was in a residential facility for groups \nhad to be placed in a facility that had an endorsement required for facilities with \nAlzheimer's  residents.  Endorsements  for  facilities  with  Alzheimer's  residents \nhave been around for a couple of decades. Unfortunately, how the law was \nwritten  and  is  now  interpreted,  was  if  anyone  had  even  a  mild  cognitive \nimpairment, they would have to be placed in a facility that had an Alzheimer's \nendorsement. These facilities are required to provide a much higher level of \ncare, which includes a one to six care ratio and are locked facilities.  \n \nI talked to Dr. Kotchevar about this issue and the technical bulletin was never \nintended  to  have  that  type  of  person  go  to  the  most  severe  setting. \nSenate Bill 362  was  written  to  fix  this  issue;  unfortunately,  when  it  was \nreleased by the Legislative Counsel Bureau it needed some corrections. I have \nsubmitted a proposed amendment (Exhibit P) to fix these issues.  \n \nEvery time someone is placed in a residential facility for groups, there is a \nphysical assessment done by a physician. After that, they are given a yearly \nassessment. Sometimes, with Alzheimer's or different types of dementia there \ncan  be  a  noticeable  decline  in  a  person's  health  and  mental  capacity.  The \nstandard  should  be,  if  that  person  is  a  threat  to  themselves  or  a  threat  to \nsomeone else or is that person a flight risk. If any of these things are going on, \nwe want the physician to recommend that person be placed in a higher level \nfacility.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 27, 2019 \nPage 15 \n \nIn the proposed amendment, Exhibit P, section 1 added:  \n \nWhen a person is admitted to a residential facility for groups, a \nphysician shall assess each resident. If he believes that the person \nneeds  a  higher  level  of  care,  the  doctor  will  indicate  that \naccordingly  and  provide  the  results  of  the  assessment  to  an \nadministrator of the residential facility for groups. In addition, such \nan assessment shall be conducted through an annual history and \nphysical and when  there are  signs of deterioration identified  by \nadministration, staff or the resident's family. This can be included \nin  the  required  admission  documents,  standard  physician's \ndetermination forms, or any medical notes.  \n \nIf as a result of the assessment, the physician determines that the \nresident:  \n \n(a) Suffers from dementia to an extent that the resident may be a \ndanger to himself or herself or others if the resident is not placed in \na  secure  unit  or  a  facility  that  assigns  not  less  than  one  staff \nmember for every six residents, any residential facility for groups in \nwhich the resident is placed must meet the requirements prescribed \nby the Board pursuant to subsection 2 of NRS 449.0302 for the \nlicensing  and  operation  of  residential  facilities  for  groups  which \nprovide care to persons with Alzheimer's disease or other severe \ndementia.  \n \n(b) Does not suffer from dementia as described in paragraph (a), \nthe resident may be placed in any residential facility for groups.  \n \nThat  is  basically  the  amendment.  There  is  some  language  in  section  4, \nsubsection  2,  paragraph  (b)  of  the  amendment,  describing  a  person  with \nAlzheimer's disease or other severe dementia.  \n \nWe tried to make this as practical and reasonable as possible. We believe about \n75  percent  of  individuals  who  are  in  assisted  living  facilities  have  some \ncognitive impairment to a point where they need to be monitored. However, \nthey are not a threat to themselves or others and are not a flight risk. When, \nand if, they become that way, then they would need to go to a higher level of \ncare. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 27, 2019 \nPage 16 \n \nWe also do not want to leave the decision specifically in the hands of the \nadministrator of that facility, because there is a monetary incentive to leave the \npatient where they are. In the worst of settings, that could happen. We wanted \nthe decision to be made by the physician, any other providers of care and, \ncertainly, that person's family.  \n \nWhat we discovered after the technical bulletin was, if someone needed that \nhigher level of care, it could cost the family upward of $6,000 more per month \nover what they were currently paying. What we do not want to happen is a \nfamily  telling  a  doctor  not  to  give  the  diagnosis  of  cognitive  impairment  or \nAlzheimer's, because they cannot afford to have the family member in a higher \nlevel facility. It is important for these facilities to know the medical diagnosis of \neach person so they can adequately care for them.  \n \nSARAH GREEN (Vice President of Operations, Mission Senior Living): \nI have been in the industry for the past 20 years as a provider. I have worked as \nan administrator to a vice president level. I have also experienced having a \nfamily  member  who  was  living  completely  independent  to  being  referred  to \nhospice care. When you experience this industry as a person and as a family \nmember, it gives you a different perspective.  \n \nWe  are  here  today  because  of  the  technical  bulletin  that  came  out  in \nSeptember 2018.  It  was  unexpected  to  the  industry  and  it  conflicted  with \ncurrent rules, regulations and expectations which were in place for physicians, \nthe communities, the providers, etc. I want to emphasize S.B. 362 references \nresidential and group homes. It is targeted toward assisted living. The assisted \nliving and group homes provide assistance for seniors. Senate Bill 362 does not \nrefer  to  nursing  homes  or  full-on  care.  We  are  referring  to  assisting  active \nseniors with daily living.  \n \nThe  technical  bulletin  came  out  and  talked  about  seniors  in  the  residential \nhomes in group settings who had a diagnosis of dementia to Alzheimer's, to \ncognitive impairment. The term \"cognitive impairment\" is so broad. I think about \neveryone in this room who has lost their keys or cell phone today or are not \nsure where they left their car in the parking lot. When we talk about senior \nliving, is it a simple element of not knowing where their keys are that has \nprompted the \"cognitive impairment\" or, truly, are they a risk to themselves? \nAre they at risk of wandering out of the facility or harming themselves and not \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 27, 2019 \nPage 17 \n \nbeing able to maintain their quality of life? That is when \"cognitive impairment\" \nneeds to be addressed. \n \nThe current rule already in place is the physician providing an assessment prior \nto admission. All residential facilities commonly called communities are required \nto have a physician do a complete history and physical within 30 days prior to \nadmission. Further, the rule is the physician must provide an annual review and \nsubmit it to the community. In addition, the current rule is the community must \nadminister an assessment that walks through all elements of daily living at time \nof admission, no less than annually, or because of a change of condition. The \nterm  \"change  of  condition\"  means  something  changed;  perhaps  a  stroke \nhappens and the patient's level of care needs to be addressed.  \n \nThis  technical  bulletin  potentially  means  the  average  senior  who  is  walking \naround, driving, shopping and participating in family activities could be required \nto  go  to  a  secured  memory  care  unit.  This  is  not  appropriate.  The  term \n\"endorsed  community\"  means  a  secured  unit,  where  windows  cannot  be \nopened above six inches, it takes a passcode to get in and out and staffing \nratios are one to six. This restricts a senior's right to live.  \n \nThe other important element in a secured memory care unit is the physical \naesthetics endorsement of the community, such as increased firewalls. These \nelements would have to be met if an assisted living facility wanted to convert to  \na  secured  memory  care  unit.  I  believe  the  DHHS  said  it  would  waive  the \nendorsement fee for licensure. This is a minimal cost when compared to the \ncosts of adding sheetrock in order to meet the two hour fire requirement.  \n \nIf the senior is not to the point where they need a secured unit, let the physician \nand outside entities participate on appropriate placement.  \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nThis bill makes sure that a doctor, independent of the facility, is making the \ndiagnosis and there is still an annual review. Is this close to what this bill does? \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nYes. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 27, 2019 \nPage 18 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDoes the bill require the physician be independent? \n \nMS. FOLEY: \nIt would be an independent physician, because medical care is not provided at \nthese  facilities.  The  facilities  provide  medication  management,  but  these \nfacilities do not have staff physicians. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWhat was the reason or specific incident that led to the technical bulletin? It \nappears this technical bulletin may have been issued to correct a problem and, if \nso, how was that problem corrected?  \n \nMS. GREEN: \nAs a provider in Nevada, we were not consulted prior to the issuance of the \ntechnical bulletin. I can speak from my own beliefs, as well as my exposure to \nthe industry. My assumption would be this technical bulletin was the result of \nelopements, meaning seniors wandering away from a community and/or home \nand the search element that followed. My assumption is this technical bulletin \nwas the result of a senior or seniors who wandered away from an established \ncommunity.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWould it be fair to say an annual assessment is adequate and perhaps there are \ntimes to call for earlier assessments? In this situation, can anyone ask for an \nassessment, at any time, to get a third party trained professional to determine if \nthat person requires another form of care?  \n \nMS. GREEN: \nThat is correct. It needs to be based on the senior and their aging process, \nrather than a sole diagnosis. Diagnosis is a huge label and the physician needs \nto assess it with input from the community and the family in terms of what the \npatient's daily activities look like. In addition, a change of condition is more \nimperative than the annual assessment. A change of condition can happen at \nany time. It could be a stroke, a urinary tract infection that goes septic or a \nroutine surgery.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 27, 2019 \nPage 19 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nFrom past testimonies in regard to cognitive care, I have heard that it is not a \nsingle event, but rather a slow decline. Even the family who are caregivers do \nnot notice it, because there are micro changes over the course of six months \nthat could add up to a significant change. What are the safeguards for people \nwho have that slow, cognitive decline that the family may not notice or be in \ndenial or caregivers who may not notice the changes? What is the trigger? Is it \nan event, such as they wandered off? How do we know we are catching them \nwhen we need to catch them?  \n \nMS. GREEN: \nThere  are  many  factors  that  fall  under  the  dementia  umbrella.  The  disease \nprocess is very different based on what form they have, what part of the brain \nit  is  attacking  and  how.  What  all  parties  need  to  be  aware  of  is  the \ndeterioration.  When are they changing? How are they changing?  Were they \npreviously independent, coming down  for meals and  now the family has to \nremind them it is meal time? Maybe the family has to remind them a second \ntime or walk with them. That deterioration is a collaboration of everyone saying \nhe or she is different than they were last month. Let us sit down and address it \nnow. Let us tell the physician and get their input.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThat sounds rational and logical from a system point. What is in the system to \nmake sure that happens? \n \nMS. GREEN: \nWhat is in the system is the care plan. The care plan is established by the \nfamily,  the  resident  and  the  community,  meaning  the  administration,  nurse, \nwellness  director  or  whatever  each  community  has  in  place.  The  care  plan \nreviews the activities of daily living from the beginning of the day to the end of \nthe day and the normal baseline of that day. When the community sees there \nare alterations to that baseline, it is their responsibility to sit down and address \nthis with the family and any responsible parties involved. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs that a common standard of care based on licensure or is that something that \nis in the Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS)? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 27, 2019 \nPage 20 \n \nMS. GREEN: \nThat is in NRS. There are requirements for the physician at time of admission \nand  the  annual  review.  The  community  responsibilities  are  at  the  time  of \nadmission  and  no  less  than  annually.  The  term  utilized  is  the  \"change  of \ncondition\". The change of condition does not have to be major, but it can mean \nthe resident no longer fits the mold for the care plan put in place for their needs.  \nI also want to point out that placing a senior in a secured unit will take away \nmore  of  their  decision-making  ability.  This  will  have  an  instantaneous, \ndetrimental, negative impact on their cognitive and emotional state. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRemainder of page intentionally left blank; signature page to follow. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 27, 2019 \nPage 21 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSeeing no further business, we are adjourned at 5:51 p.m.  \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n   \nMichelle Hamilton, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 27, 2019 \nPage 22 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nExhibit / \nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \n# of pages \n  A  2    Agenda \n  B  7    Attendance Roster \nS.B. 174  C  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 192  D  3  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 202  E  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 216  F  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 270  G  3  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 284  H  4  Senator David R.

(BDR 40-567) \n \nMS. COMLOSSY: \nI will read the summary of the bill and amendments from the work session \ndocument (Exhibit D). \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI have problems with the amendments and the bill itself. I asked the legal staff \nwhat the definition of \"woman\" was. The understanding was a woman is a \nperson  who  has  started  puberty.  This  will  mean  that  11-year-old  girls,  or \nyounger, can have an abortion without the knowledge of their parents. The \ngestational age can be up to the time of delivery, as in 40 weeks. If something \ngoes wrong with post-abortion, there is no protection for liability or recourse for \nthose concerned about issues after a procedure.  \n \nThere are some significant flaws in the bill. I will be voting no. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThis bill, in its original format, did have portions dealing with parental consent \nand notification. Those aspects of the bill were removed.  \n \nI will entertain a motion on S.B. 179. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2019 \nPage 4 \n \nSENATOR WOODHOUSE MOVED TO AMEND AND DO PASS AS \nAMMENDED S.B. 179. \n \n  SENATOR SPEARMAN SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE  MOTION  CARRIED.  (SENATORS  HARDY  AND  HAMMOND \nVOTED NO.) \n \n* * * * *  \n \nSENATE BILL 228: Revises provisions relating to marijuana and industrial hemp. \n(BDR 54-180) \n \nMS. COMLOSSY: \nI will read the summary of the bill and amendments from the work session \ndocument (Exhibit E). \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI am not clear on the definition of a structural integration practitioner. Do we \nhave  this  definition  in  statute?  I  have  challenges  with  products  being \nadministered. Are those administering them being exposed to possibly harmful \nproducts?  Have  we  added  that  the  product  provided  by  the  patient  can  be \napplied? \n \nMS. COMLOSSY: \nThe  amendments  remove  a  person  who  provides  wellness  services.  The \nproposed  amendment  by  the  City  of  Las  Vegas  removes  all  references  to \nmarijuana-infused  products  and  marijuana  products  in  general.  Structural \nintegration practitioners would be applying cannabidiol (CBD) or industrial hemp \nproducts. As the bill is written, a patient or client can provide the product to be \nadministered by the person doing the application. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThis brings up the issue of who determines what the CBD content is? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nBy removing the references to marijuana and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), are \nwe talking about all over-the-counter (OTC) products that can be purchased? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2019 \nPage 5 \n \nWILLIAM ADLER (Silver State Government Relations): \nThe  intent  of  the  amendment  is  to  remove  the  words  \"marijuana\"  and \n\"marijuana-infused products\". Products sold in dispensaries have relatively low \nlevels of THC. Some lotions and topicals do have the psychoactive ingredient, \nTHC, in them.  \n \nThe City of Las Vegas believes we should regulate the products and prevent \npeople from applying excessive amounts. The person applying the product could \nhave overexposure to the product.  \n \nThis amendment is only for CBD products which are a Schedule V drug pursuant \nto the Nevada State Board of Pharmacy and can now be purchased in many \nstores and also applies to veterinarians. To my knowledge, animal treats contain \nCBD; there are not regulated THC pet substances. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWould this hold true for massage therapists to apply any other OTC product a \ncustomer may provide? Would this be different from any other class of products \nwe have talked about today? \n \nMR. ADLER: \nIt is common for patients to provide their own products due to allergies and \nthings  of  that  nature.  This  would  be  just  another  product  a  patient  would \nprovide that happens to contain CBD. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWe do not allow a patient to return a medication that has been opened, as we \ndo not know what it contains. We do not know the concentration of CBD in the \nbottle because we do not know what they actually purchased or may have \nadded to it. This is one of the challenges I have with \"provide your own\" as we \ndo not know what \"your own\" is, or what may have been substituted.  \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThere is nothing in this bill that requires anyone to accept any product to be \napplied or requires a professional to do anything with any product provided. \nMany who have gone to a massage therapist have provided various oils such as \nlavender and peppermint.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2019 \nPage 6 \n \nA National chain has announced they will begin selling OTC drugs like this, \nbecause it is an alternative to many of the opioids being prescribed over the \nyears. With the opioid abuse we are living with today, one can weigh whether \nor not it is prudent to use a topical application that would relieve pain or use the \nopioid. \n \nThere  is  nothing  in  this  bill  stating  \"you  must  do  this\".  It  simply  states  if \nsomeone provides the product, the professional can choose to use it or not. It \nwould be like someone taking nail polish to a nail technician for a manicure or \npedicure.  \n \nOne of the issues we face today with CBD and hemp is the lack of knowledge \namong nonprofessionals confusing these products with marijuana; CBD is not \nmarijuana. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nOur legal counsel has the structural integration practitioner citation. \n \nERIC ROBBINS (Committee Counsel): \nStructural  integration  practitioner  is  defined  in  Nevada  Revised  Statutes \n(NRS) 640C.090 as a \"person who is licensed pursuant to the provisions of this \nchapter to engage in the practice of structural integration.\" \n \nThe term \"structural integration\" is defined in NRS 640C.085 as: \n \n…the  application  of  a  system  of  manual  therapy,  movement \neducation and embodiment education that is intended to improve \nthe functional relationship of the parts of the human body to each \nother within the influences of gravity.  \n \nThe  term  does  not  include  \"the  practice  of  physical  therapy  as  defined  in \nNRS 640.024  or  chiropractic  as  defined  in  NRS  634.013  including,  without \nlimitation, chiropractic adjustment or manipulation, as defined in NRS 634.014 \nand 634.173, respectively.\" \n \nSANDRA ANDERSON (Board of Massage Therapy): \nI am the Executive Director of the Board of Massage Therapy. You have given \nus the legal definition of structural integration. Structural integration is Rolfing; a \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2019 \nPage 7 \n \ndeep  tissue  modality  requiring  more  education  than  the  average  massage \ntherapist modality.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWhen the bill was originally heard the advice to your licensees would be, at the \nvery least, to wear gloves if they are going to accept any product to be applied, \nnot one they have chosen to use in their practice. \n \nMS. ANDERSON: \nYes, that is correct. They can wear gloves or deny to topically apply a product. \nIf they have an allergy to a product, they have that discretion. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWhy  are  we  differentiating  structural  integration  practitioner  from  massage \ntherapist if they are under the Board of Massage Therapy? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThis is how it came out of drafting. The bill sponsor may be able to better \nclarify this for us. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nIt  is  important  to  note  they  are  both  licensed,  as  doctors  and  dentists  are \nlicensed, and it is part of NRS.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will entertain a motion on S.B. 228. \n \n  SENATOR WOODHOUSE MOVED TO AMEND AND DO PASS AS \nAMMENDED S.B. 228. \n \n  SENATOR SPEARMAN SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED. (SENATOR HARDY VOTED NO.) \n \n* * * * *  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the work session and open the hearing on S.B. 266. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2019 \nPage 8 \n \nSENATE BILL 266: Provides for the establishment of the Mental Health First Aid \nProgram. (BDR 39-550) \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN (Senatorial District No.1): \nI  am  here  to  present  S.B. 266  for  your  consideration.  The  bill  requires  the \nDivision of Public and Behavioral Health (DPBH) of the Department of Health and \nHuman Services (DHHS) to establish the Mental Health First Aid Program to:  \n \n…provide training concerning the identification and assistance of \npersons who have a mental illness or substance use disorder or \nwho  may  be  experiencing  a  mental  health  or  substance  abuse \ncrisis. \n \nSenate Bill 266 is necessary for a variety of reasons. We know that Nevada \nfaces a severe shortage of mental health providers which impacts access to \ncare, which means mental health conditions often go undiagnosed. By training \nmore people to recognize the symptoms of mental illness we may be able to \nidentify  those  who  need  mental  health  services  and  connect  them  to  the \nlicensed professionals they need.  \n \nWe  are  in  the  midst  of  an  ongoing  opioid  epidemic  which  kills  more  than \none Nevadan every day. Training more people to recognize and provide initial \nassistance to individuals in crises can only help improve their chances for a \npositive outcome.  \n \nThe Mental Health First Aid Program joins a number of other programs. We have \nfirst aid for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and for the Heimlich maneuver. When \nI was in basic training we had training for escape, evasion and self-defense. \nThis bill allows for another type of training to help people who are in dire need \ngiven the fact we do not have the necessary mental health resources.  \n \nThe Mental Health First Aid Program required by S.B. 266 would be established \nby  the  DPBH,  if  money  is  available.  The  program  training  would  include \nrecognizing the symptoms of mental illness or substance use disorder, providing \ninitial assistance to persons experiencing a mental health or substance abuse \ncrisis, and guiding persons requiring assistance with mental health issues. It \nwould  include,  without  limitation,  persons  experiencing  a  mental  health  or \nsubstance abuse crisis, to professionals qualified to provide such assistance. It \nwill also include comforting a person experiencing a mental health or substance \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2019 \nPage 9 \n \nabuse crisis, helping a person with a mental illness or substance use disorder \navoid a mental health or substance abuse crisis and promoting healing, recovery \nand good mental health. \n \nThe  bill  requires  DPBH  to  consult  with  various  interested  persons  when \ndeveloping  the  Program.  The  Program  will  inform  the  public  and  interested \ngroups such as emergency medical service providers, law enforcement officers, \nteachers,  school  administrators  and  primary  health  care  providers  about  the \navailability and benefits of mental health first aid training.  \n \nFinally, S.B. 266 requires DPBH to compile and submit an annual report to the \nGovernor and the Legislature regarding the number of people who provide such \ntraining, the number of training sessions and the groups to whom such training \nwas provided. \n \nFrom January 28, 2019 to February 2, 2019, the Born This Way Foundation \nwith the Benson Strategy Group took a survey of over 2,000 young people in \nthe United States ages 13 to 24. They explored how youth view their own \nmental wellness, their access to key mental health resources and how they \nwant those resources to look. Nearly nine in ten young people stated mental \nhealth  is  a  priority.  Only  four  in  ten  rated  their  own  mental  health  highly. \nApproximately one in three young people said there is a lack of reliable access \nto resources to support their mental wellness, or to address a mental health \nissue. Youth cited knowing where to go and the cost as key barriers to mental \nhealth  resources.  While  young  people  struggle  to  access  mental  health \nresources, they are open to using a wide variety of them and want to learn skills \nto support their mental wellness.  \n \nOver the last two years, the Born This Way Foundation has trained more than \n1 million people across the Country in using mental health first aid. I would urge \nyour support for S.B. 266. \n \nTRISTA MILLER (Community Outreach Coordinator, Tuck and Run Foundation): \nI will read from my written testimony (Exhibit F). \n \nJULIE  KOTCHEVAR  (Administrator;  Division  of  Public  and  Behavioral  Health, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nWhile the bill states \"to the extent money is available\", there were questions on \nwhere the money would come from and when it would be available. We are \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2019 \nPage 10 \n \nlooking at grant funding sources to pay for this Program and whether this would \ncome under public health preparedness for emergency medical services.  \n \nThe best description for this service is neighbors helping neighbors and helping \npeople  to  learn  how  to  identify  a  potential  mental  health  or  substance  use \ndisorder, so people can be referred to the correct services. Most people see a \nproblem but are not sure what they are experiencing. They do not want to \nintrude or make an unwelcome inquiry or referral. This bill is about educating the \ncommunity as a whole on what mental health first aid training is. The more \npeople that are trained in a community the better.  \n \nIt is our intent to find funding for this Program. We have been reviewing types \nof discretionary grant funding. \n \nJULIE MURRAY (President, Nevada Medical Center): \nI am in favor of S.B. 266 and will read from my written testimony (Exhibit G). \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nYou want to train as many people as possible on the signs of people in need of \nfirst  aid.  The  list  of  those  who  could  be  trained  are  shown  in  the  bill  in \nsection 1, subsection 3, paragraph (b). If someone does not recognize the signs \nand does not administer first aid or attempt to figure out what is happening, \ndoes this open someone up to liability? \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI do not believe it does. There are many signs to look for when people are \ndepressed  to  the  point  of  suicidal  ideation,  substance  abuse  or  showing  a \nmental health crisis. This bill intends to ensure more people understand these \nsigns. At first you might not recognize everything, but you get better as time \ngoes by. We are not trying to put people in legal jeopardy. This is voluntary and \nwould help friends and family.  \n \nWhen someone completes suicide, those left behind always ask why. Why did I \nnot see the signs; what was there I should have known yesterday and did not \nsee today? There is no \"liability\" there. It is just a matter of learning the signs \nand being able to, even if wrong, ask the necessary questions to assess the \nsituation and take the correct action to save a life.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2019 \nPage 11 \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nIt  is  important  we  get  on  the  record  that  this  is  not  opening  up  the  Good \nSamaritan Clause. People are going to ask questions because they feel they \nhave a good friend they do not want to lose who seems a little out of character. \nToo many people with first aid skills are afraid to practice those skills. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nIn 2015 and 2017, Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson presented a bill that \nwould require medical professionals to be trained in recognizing the signs of \nsuicidal ideation. Statistics had shown someone completing suicide had usually \nseen a physician or medical professional within the last 30 days.  \n \nThis bill will not leave it solely to the medical professionals. We are providing \nthe average non-medical person the signs to look for if they are concerned one \nof their friends or a family member might be in trouble. \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nThe bill states in section 1, subsection 3, paragraph (b) there is a plan to inform \nthe public. Do you have an idea of how this will happen? Will it mostly be a \nwebsite on the internet? Is there a program that has worked in other states? \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nOthers states have people, communities and professional groups discussing the \ntraining.  There  is  also  social  media  and  other  ways  we  will  advertise  the \ntraining. We want to use all means available to us to ensure people understand \nthis is another way to complement or provide additional support in an area of \nmental health where it is desperately needed. \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nI thought we would perhaps leave the plan up to Ms. Kotchevar and the DPBH. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThe DPBH will be administering the Program. \n \nDAN MUSGROVE (Vice President, Strategies 360): \nI am here today representing a number of clients in the behavioral and mental \nhealth arena in support of S.B. 266. The more people know and understand the \nsigns, they can better counteract the stigma surrounding mental health. People \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2019 \nPage 12 \n \nfeel like they are alone and when we empower people to have the knowledge on \nhow to deal with someone who might have issues, we are all better off. \n \nROBIN REEDY (National Alliance on Mental Illness Nevada): \nI am neutral on S.B. 266. The Mental Health First Aid Program is a phenomenal \nprogram. I have taken a course and, even though I have been volunteering for \nthe past eight years, it proved to be very beneficial. We at the National Alliance \non Mental Illness (NAMI) would like to encourage the concept of equivalency \nintroduced into the bill.  \n \nMultiple national organizations, including NAMI, have created age appropriate \ntraining  including  mental  health  and  substance  use  disorders,  targeted  to \ndifferent segments of the population. The Crisis Intervention Team Training for \nlaw enforcement and first responders, in which NAMI participates, achieves the \ngoal of the bill. We have NAMI programs like Ending the Silence, designed for \nmiddle  and  high  school  students,  school  staff,  and  parents  or  guardians  of \nmiddle or high school aged youth. We have NAMI Basics, which is a class for \nparents, guardians and other family caregivers who provide care for youth ages \n22  or  younger  who  are  experiencing  mental  health  symptoms.  We  have \nFamily-to-Family which is a class for families, significant others and friends of \npeople  with  mental  health  conditions,  as  well  as  one  geared  toward \nprofessionals. \n \nAll of these programs could help accomplish the goal of widespread training in \nmental health awareness and response. It would be helpful for the DPBH to \ncontract with many qualified community-based organizations with employees or \nvolunteers  qualified  with  mental  health  first  aid  or  equivalent  instructors  to \nprovide the training. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 266 and open the hearing on S.B. 315. \n \nSENATE BILL 315: Revises provisions relating to public health. (BDR 40-581) \n \nSENATOR JOYCE WOODHOUSE (Senatorial District No. 5): \nI am here to present S.B. 315 for your consideration. \n \nPediatric  cancer,  by  definition,  is  a  rare  disease  accounting  for  less  than \n1 percent of cancer diagnoses each year. While rare, more than 15,000 cases \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2019 \nPage 13 \n \nof pediatric cancer in the United States are diagnosed annually. This means \n1 in 408  children  will  be  diagnosed  with  cancer  before  the  age  of  15,  and \n1 in 285 children will be diagnosed before they turn 20. These children and their \nfamilies  suddenly  face  some  of  the  worst  news  imaginable,  often  without \nwarning.  \n \nI had the opportunity to get to know one family receiving such news. They \nfought but lost their young son to cancer. Senate Bill 315 is their effort to raise \nawareness  about  childhood  cancer,  studying  and  identifying  strategies  to \nprevent  such  rare  diseases  and  encourage  health  care  providers  to  receive \ncontinuing education in the diagnosis of these diseases. I am honored to assist \nthem in this effort to commemorate their son Carson and allow Aubrey Arreola \nto tell you the story of her son. \n \nAUBREY ARREOLA: \nI am here to support S.B. 315. This bill will create the Rare Disease Advisory \nCouncil providing a central hub for knowledge. It is to ensure pediatricians and \nmedical professionals in Nevada can receive time sensitive information, training, \neducation and support in a family's greatest time of need. \n \nI am here as a Nevadan, a wife, a daughter, a sister and devastated mother. I \nlost a child to a senseless disease that could have been caught sooner with \nadequate  training and a central system of knowledge around childhood  rare \ndiseases and cancers.  \n \nCarson Arreola was born on October 29, 2009. He was our first child and the \nlight of our lives. As he grew older his personality grew larger than life. Some of \nhis \"Carsonisms\" still bring joy to my family and friends. \"Good night mommy, \nsweet dreams my love girl\" or \"mommy, you are a real nice lady.\" He also knew \nbad boys do not get things, and good boys do like an office and sandwiches. As \na baseball fanatic, one day I told him, \"Carson, you are my little angel.\" His \nappropriate response was, \"No I am not, I am a Padre.\" \n \nWe took Carson to his pediatrician on May 4, 2016, for what we thought was \nstrep throat. After a week of antibiotics and running a fever we took him back \nand received another type of antibiotic. Carson was still not feeling well on \nMay 15, 2016. We took him to urgent care to inquire why, after two rounds of \nantibiotics, his strep throat would not go away.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2019 \nPage 14 \n \nAfter  two  blood  draws  at  the  urgent  care  we  were  sent  to  the  St.  Rose \nemergency room for three additional blood draws. It was there we received the \ndevastating news Carson had a rare and aggressive childhood leukemia. Our \nfamily was shocked that our highly trained, capable and trusted pediatrician was \nnot able to identify and diagnose any symptoms of the childhood disease. We \nwere even more shocked to discover our pediatrician was himself a childhood \nleukemia survivor.  \n \nWithout an established Rare Disease Advisory Council within Nevada relating to \nthe prevalence and treatment of rare childhood diseases, our pediatrician was \nunable to pick up the symptoms that could have been addressed and potentially \nhave saved Carson's life.  \n \nWhen we arrived at the emergency room, Carson's white blood cell count was \n400,000. A normal white blood cell count in a healthy child is 4,500 to 11,000. \nDue  to  his  dangerously  high  potassium  levels,  he  was  rushed  to  Sunrise \nChildren's  Hospital  where  he  would  have  a  port  placed  and  begin  dialysis \nimmediately.  As  you  can  imagine,  the  impact  this  had  on  our  family  was \ndevastating. Just 24 hours earlier, we thought our son had a case of strep \nthroat and now we stood helpless as he was placed under anesthesia to have a \nport placed in his chest. \n \nOn  May  16,  2016,  Carson  was  officially  diagnosed  with  T-cell  acute \nlymphoblastic leukemia. We spent the next three days watching our six-year-old \nson's  body  slowly  shut  down.  He  experienced  breathing  trouble,  kidney \nproblems and heart arrhythmias. At 3:30 a.m. on Wednesday, May 18, 2016, \nhis heart stopped twice and the doctors were able to revive him. At 2:58 p.m., \nafter doctors tried everything humanly possible to save him, we held our little \nboy as he quietly went to heaven. \n \nCarson was a shining light with a heart of gold. He was outgoing, funny, smart, \nkind, artistic, fearless and happy. He was obsessed with dinosaurs and knew \nthe name of every one by the time he was three years old. He loved his stuffed \nTiggers, dancing, drawing, baseball, motorcycles and monster trucks. He loved \nand thought the world of his little brother and sister. He had a zest for life that \nwas contagious and refreshing. It was impossible to be in a bad mood around \nCarson. Joseph P. Kennedy said, \"When the young bury the old, time heals the \npain and sorrow, but when the process is reversed the sorrow remains forever.\" \nBecause of this we have a drive, a passion, and commitment to share our story.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2019 \nPage 15 \n \nI am here with my husband Marc, my father Jerry Gerber and family friend Julie \nPazina to stand with Senator Woodhouse in support of this legislation. We do \nthis to help raise awareness for early childhood cancer detection and do what \nwe can to ensure no other family has to endure the earth-shattering devastation \nwe did. We will talk about the day we lost Carson, but Carson is not lost; we \nknow where he is. He finished the work he was sent here to do and was called \nhome. He will continue to influence us as we try to become better because of \nhim. \n \nJULIE PAZINA: \nThis legislation is very important to me because of my friendship with Aubrey \nArreola and her family. It feels like just yesterday we were on our way to lunch \nand Aubrey shared she was pregnant with her second child, and how excited \nCarson was to be a big brother.  \n \nSenate  Bill  315  has  the  ability  to  educate  parents  and  children  about  the \nimportance of annual physical examinations and provide continuing education to \nNevada medical professionals about the diagnosis of rare diseases. It will create \na Rare Disease Advisory Council to study and treat rare diseases and make \nrecommendations based on their studies for future legislation.  \n \nEducation and communication are critically important in preventing more families \nfrom suffering the tragedy of a child's passing. These are common steps that \ncan save lives. As Nevadans, we can come together and take the steps to \nprevent these tragedies by passing S.B. 315.  \n \nSENTOR WOODHOUSE: \nI will review the highlights of S.B. 315 and the way this bill aims to address \nchildhood cancer. \n \nSections 2 and 3 create the Rare Disease Advisory Council within the DHHS. At \nleast seven other states have established such councils, and many more have \nconsidered similar legislation. In Nevada, this Council will examine the incidents, \ncauses  and  economic  burden  of  rare  diseases  in  our  State.  It  will  increase \nawareness  among  the  general  public  and  health  care  providers  and  identify \nstrategies to prevent and control rare diseases. It will also study the effects of \nearly treatment, as well as delayed or inappropriate treatment. It will establish a \ncomprehensive plan for rare disease management and develop a registry of rare \ndiseases diagnosed in our State.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2019 \nPage 16 \n \nSections 4 through 6 increase public education about the importance of annual \nphysical examinations for children. The early diagnosis of childhood cancer is \ndifficult, in part because this is a rare condition, and because the symptoms are \nsimilar to other common childhood diseases. No widely recommended screening \ntool exists to identify the wide variety of childhood cancers. However, experts \nagree routine childhood physicals provide an extremely important opportunity for \nparents  to  discuss  a  child's  growth  and  development  with  trained  health \nprofessionals. If necessary, a physician can refer a child for additional testing \nbased on the child's symptoms and history. Unfortunately, many parents only \nseek medical care when their children are sick. \n \nThe goals of the above sections of S.B. 315 are to emphasize the importance of \nannual physicals for children. This is achieved by requiring the DHHS to include \nsuch information in appropriate public  health programs and activities. It  will \nrequire  school  districts  and  charter  schools  to  include  such  information  in \nwritten  communications  with  parents  and  guardians  regarding  the  health  of \npupils, and require health and physical education courses to include instruction \non this topic. \n \nThe third piece of the bill requires the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to \ndesign, prepare and issue special license plates to increase the awareness of \nchildhood cancer. The license plates will include the phrase \"Cure Childhood \nCancer.\" These and related changes are provided in sections 7 through 16 of \nthe bill. \n \nI received an email from the DMV regarding the special license plate. It included \nan amendment which makes it more consistent with other special license plate \nrequirements we have before us this Legislative Session. I will provide that \nemail to the Committee.  \n \nFinally, sections 17 through 22 aim to help health care providers better diagnose \nchildhood  cancer  by  requiring  appropriate  licensing  boards  to  annually \ndisseminate  information  concerning  the  signs  of  pediatric  cancer.  It  also \nencourages their licensees to receive training and education in the diagnosis of \nrare diseases as part of their required continuing education.  \n \nUnfortunately, the Arreola family is not alone in their experiences with Carson. \nOther families have faced a similar diagnosis and struggle, as will more in the \nfuture. This bill aims to enhance the awareness and education among children, \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2019 \nPage 17 \n \nfamilies, health care providers and the general community to give children the \nbest chance possible of an early diagnosis when these tragic situations happen. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nDuring  the  Interim  we  heard,  all  too  often,  stories  from  parents  who  have \nchildren with rare childhood diseases having to go elsewhere for treatment. I \nagree this is a very important bill. \n \nMARLA TURNER: \nI  speak  today  as  an  individual  and  retired  clinical  research  professional \nspecializing  in  oncology  in  support  of  S.B.  315.  This  bill  will  protect  our \nchildren. The cancer survival rates for pediatric children hover above 80 percent, \napproximately 82 percent; significantly higher than that of adults. If we are able \nto diagnose our children earlier, we will raise this survival rate even higher.  \n \nALEXIS MOTAREX: \nMost days I am here representing the Nevada Chapter of Associated General \nContractors, but today I am here as the mother of a cancer survivor. \n \nFebruary 20, 2012, we learned our son Cooper had leukemia. Our otherwise \nhealthy four-year-old was suddenly in a fight for his life. Hours after receiving \nthe  news,  we  were  flown  by  air  ambulance  to  Oakland  Children's  Hospital \nwhere Cooper was subjected to a battery of tests to determine exactly what \ntype of leukemia he had. We learned it was acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), \nthe most curable type of leukemia.  \n \nCooper  began  treatment  on  February  22,  2012,  the  first  of  1,129  days  of \nchemo; 3 years, 2 months and 4 days. We spent the first three weeks in the \nhospital in Oakland where Cooper was given high doses of chemotherapy and \nsteroids to induce remission. He got violently ill from the chemotherapy. The \nsteroids made him grumpy and irritable, causing a gain of a third of his body \nweight in two weeks. His hair began to fall out and his face became so bloated \nhe was unrecognizable.  \n \nWhen they say ALL is the most curable form of leukemia, it does not mean it is \neasy. Cooper had to take at least one form of chemotherapy every night. He \nhad to take steroids for 2, 28-day pulses in the first 8 months, and then 5 day \npulses every month for the remainder of his treatment. He had 35 or 40 spinal \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2019 \nPage 18 \n \ntaps and chemotherapy infused through a port surgically implanted above his \nheart. \n \nThe treatment for cancer is vicious. He missed most of kindergarten and a good \npart of first and second grades. He could not spend much time with friends and \nhad to stop playing sports. He woke up with chemo hangovers, lost all of his \nhair several times and lost and gained weight. He broke out in rashes and got \nsores in his mouth. The skin on his hands, neck and face became so inflamed \nand chapped it appeared it would split open. Cooper's immune system was \ncompromised so he got sick easily and every fever resulted in a trip to the \nemergency room, where more often than not, he had to be admitted. He was \ntaken by air ambulance to Oakland twice; an experience you hope never to have \nonce.  \n \nA year into treatment he became very ill. At first, his doctors thought it was \nanother virus, but it became bad very fast as it can in immunocompromised \npatients. He was finally diagnosed with pneumonia; his oxygen level was at \n69 percent. They do not like it when they fall below 95 percent. He spent \n15 days in the hospital, 5 of which were in pediatric intensive care. We were \nwatching him die and he knew it as well. At one point he looked at me and said \n\"mommy I am scared.\" All I could say was \"I know baby, you have this,\" and \nhe did.  \n \nIt  was  determined  the  pneumonia  was  caused  by  the  rhinovirus,  the  virus \ncausing the common cold. Because of what the current treatment for leukemia \ndoes to the body, Cooper almost died from the common cold. \n \nCooper received his final chemotherapy on April 26, 2015. He is healthy and \nstrong, in sixth grade and a straight-A student. He is back to skiing, playing \nbaseball and golf. Despite everything Cooper suffered for over three years, we \nconsider  ourselves  lucky.  No  family  should  suffer  at  the  hands  of  pediatric \ncancer. No parent should ever have to bury their child because we cannot find a \ncure.  \n \nWe  need  more  awareness  about  pediatric  cancer.  Awareness  evolves  to \nfunding, and funding means research. Research means better treatment options \nand maybe someday a cure. Parents deserve to watch their children grow up \nhealthy and happy. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2019 \nPage 19 \n \nGEORGE ROSS (Comprehensive Cancer Centers of Nevada): \nComprehensive  Cancer  Centers  of  Nevada  supports  S.B.  315.  We  lost  our \noldest son very suddenly at the same age as Carson, but for a different reason. I \nhope  people  have  the  same  experience  as  Cooper  and  not  the  experience \nCarson had. \n \nJERRY GERBER: \nI am the father of Aubrey Arreola and the grandfather of Carson. I am here to \nvoice my support for S.B. 315. The responsibility of our elected officials is very \ndaunting. With your support of this bill, as you heard my daughter so eloquently \ntestify, if this bill is passed, you can negate the trauma so many Nevada families \nwill have to endure.  \n \nI  heard  a  quote  many  years  ago  in  a  high  school  government  class,  which \nepitomizes my belief in government. It was the late Senator Hubert Humphrey \nwho said, \n \nThe moral test of government is how that government treats those \nwho are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the \ntwilight of life, the elderly; and those in the shadows of life, the \nsick, the needy and the handicapped. \n \nI  hope,  with  your  support  of  this  bill,  it  can  be  proven  once  again  that \ngovernment can truly be a protector and guardian of its citizens. Even more so, \nits greatest and most precious resource is children. \n \nMARC ARREOLA: \nI am the father of Carson Arreola. Thank you for listening to the story of our \nson.  I  am  here  to  support  S.B.  315  to  help  further  the  research  in  early \ndetection of childhood cancer in hope of preventing situations like ours from \nhappening to other families and to rid this horrible disease once and for all. \n \nCONNOR CAIN (PhRMA): \nI  am  here  on  behalf  of  the  Pharmaceutical  Research  and  Manufacturers  of \nAmerica. We have submitted a letter in support of S.B. 315 (Exhibit H). I would \nlike to say thank you to Carson and Cooper and their families for being here, \nand for this legislation. We believe it is a great way to promote innovative \ntreatments. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2019 \nPage 20 \n \nTOM MCCOY (American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network): \nThe American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network is in the neutral position \nto S.B. 315. I will read from my written testimony (Exhibit I). Childhood Cancer \nAction Day was last week on Capitol Hill. Volunteers from our organization and \nother childhood cancer groups were walking the halls advocating for passage of \nthe bills I mentioned in my testimony.  \n \nMariah,  one  of  our  volunteers,  was  diagnosed  at  the  age  of  one  with \nneuroblastoma, the most common cancer in infants. With 18 rounds of radiation \nand several surgeries on a one-year-old, survival was questionable. Mariah was \ngiven experimental chemotherapy and it saved her life. As an adult, she has had \n43 surgeries, is at risk for 8 secondary cancers and has 100 different disorders, \ndiseases and medical issues. These are late effects developed years after her \ntreatment as an infant. She deals with chronic pain each day and asked the \nlawmakers she visited last week to fund childhood cancer research which, right \nnow, only receives about 4 percent of all cancer research dollars.  \n \nSEAN MCDONALD: (Administrator, Central Services Division, Department of Motor \nVehicles): \nWe  stand  in  the  neutral  position  for  S.B. 315.  I  will  read  from  my  written \ntestimony (Exhibit J). The changes made were strictly administrative, ensuring \nthe allocation of fees collected would go to the appropriate channels to benefit, \nin this case, the organization serving to facilitate the educational component. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThat  language  is  in  the  sponsor's  hand  and  you  are  comfortable  with  that \nlanguage? \n \nMR. MCDONALD: \nWe are comfortable with the language as drafted. \n \nSENATOR WOODHOUSE: \nI hope you will join me in support of the measure that is before you and advance \nawareness and education regarding childhood cancer. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 315 and open the hearing on S.B. 370. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2019 \nPage 21 \n \nSENATE  BILL  370:  Revises  the  State  Plan  for  Medicaid  and  the  Children's \nHealth Insurance Program. (BDR 38-966) \n \nSENATOR JAMES OHRENSCHALL (Senatorial District No. 21): \nI  am  the  Deputy  Public  Defender  in  Juvenile  Court  in  Clark  County.  As  a \npracticing attorney, I have represented many children and have seen many who \nare Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) children; children exposed to alcohol in the \nwomb.  \n \nPracticing  in  the  Juvenile  Court,  I  have  found  there  is  therapy  that  can  be \nhelpful for these children in terms of the outcomes for the rest of their lives. It is \nthe Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) therapy that has, for decades, proven so \neffective for children on the autism spectrum. In southern Nevada, even though \ndoctors were recommending ABA, the great majority of the children I saw were \ncovered  under  State  insurance  through  Medicaid,  or  the  Children's  Health \nInsurance Program, and there was an issue with the therapy being covered. This \nis why I sponsored S.B. 370. \n \nKELLY VENCI GONZALEZ (Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada): \nLegal Aid Center of Southern Nevada supports S.B. 370. I will read from my \nwritten testimony (Exhibit K). \n \nJENNIFER ROBERTSON: \nI am in support of S.B. 370 and will read from my written testimony (Exhibit L). \n \nAn effective therapy for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) children is \nABA, but it is not the only therapy. It will not be effective for every child with \nFASD. I hope this bill will cover other effective therapies for FASD children, not \nonly ABA. \n \nHEATHER MORRIS: \nI  am  here  in  support  of  S.B. 370  and  will  read  from  my  written  testimony \n(Exhibit M). \n \nGEOFFREY SIMMONS: \nI  am  here  in  support  of  S.B. 370  and  will  read  from  my  written  testimony \n(Exhibit N). \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2019 \nPage 22 \n \nHOLLY SUMMERS: \nI  am  here  in  support  of  S.B. 370  and  will  read  from  my  written  testimony \n(Exhibit O). \n \nCOLLEEN MORRIS: \nI  am  a  pediatrician  and  geneticist  in  support  of  S.B. 370.  Having  practiced \ngenetics in other states, Nevada's prevalence of FAS is at least 5 percent. We \nhave a large number of children who often go undiagnosed because the severe \nend of the spectrum is easier to see due to the presence of the facial features. \nHowever, those children not having these facial features are more difficult to \ndiagnose.  \n \nThis  is  why  the  team  approach  at  the  Ackerman  Center  for  Autism  and \nNeurodevelopment Solutions at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas School of \nMedicine  is  so  important  in  making  the  diagnosis  for  these  children.  As \nprofessionals, we are frustrated that making the diagnosis is only the first step. \nThe  next  step  is  finding  appropriate  treatment.  It  is  hopeful  that  with  the \npassage of S.B. 370, there will be more trained and available individuals to treat \nthese children and young adults still present in our community. \n \nSENATOR OHRENSCHALL: \nThere  is  a  proposed,  friendly  amendment  (Exhibit  P)  from  the  Nevada \nAssociation of Health Plans. This amendment will add that a managed care \norganization shall cover medically necessary treatment of FASD. \n \nThis bill will help many children perhaps not receiving the appropriate diagnosis. \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nIn  subsection  4,  it  states  \"medically  necessary\"  habilitative  or  rehabilitative \ncare. Are you able to tell me a little more about what this means? Is there a list \nof what is medically necessary? \n \nSENATOR OHRENSCHALL: \nAs I understand from the legislation on insurance for children on the autism \nspectrum,  \"medically  necessary\"  would  be  \"recommended  in  the  treatment \nplan\", whether ABA therapy, speech therapy or counseling. I would be willing to \nhave someone with more expertise explain it further if needed. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2019 \nPage 23 \n \nTOM CLARK (Nevada Association of Health Plans): \nThe Nevada Association of Health Plans supports S.B. 370 and the proposed \namendment, Exhibit P. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 370 and open the hearing on S.B. 363. \n \nSENATE BILL 363: Provides for the creation of the Nevada Stem Cell Center. \n(BDR 40-1017) \n \nSENATOR WOODHOUSE: \nI am here to present S.B. 363 for your consideration. This bill establishes the \nNevada Stem Cell Center as an independent, nonprofit corporation to provide \nstem cell treatments, conduct stem cell research and educate the public about \nthese types of cells. The Center will be closely associated through collaboration \nwith  the  University  of  Nevada,  Las  Vegas  (UNLV),  as  well  as  its  Board  of \nDirectors which includes, among others, the President of UNLV and the Dean of \nthe UNLV School of Medicine.  \n \nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, stem cells have the remarkable \npotential to develop into many different cell types in the body. Serving as a sort \nof repair system for the body, they can theoretically divide without limit to \nreplenish other cells as long as a person or animal is still alive. When a stem cell \ndivides, each daughter cell has the potential to either remain a stem cell or \nbecome another type of cell with a more specialized function such as muscle \ncell, red blood cell or a brain cell. \n \nStem  cell  research  and  treatments  represent  the  vanguard  of  scientific \ntreatment. I believe the Legislature should support Nevada's entrance into this \nfield. \n \nMIKE SCHNEIDER: \nI appreciate the opportunity to present S.B. 363 to the Committee. Stem cells \nhold great potential to better understand how diseases occur. They have the \npotential to replace cell tissues damaged or destroyed by illness to replicate \nthemselves over and over for long periods of time. They also have the potential \nto create treatment and cures for diseases.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2019 \nPage 24 \n \nTo date, scientists and health care professionals have made impressive strides \nusing stem cells in the treatment of complicated diseases such as leukemia, \nlymphoma, multiple myelomas, rheumatoid arthritis and autism. Clinical trials \ninvolving stem cells are ongoing throughout the United States for numerous \nother  conditions  as  researchers  explore  the  possibilities  of  these  cells.  The \nNevada Stem Cell Center will offer opportunities for Nevadans to receive cutting \nedge therapy. It will be an opportunity for the UNLV School of Medicine to \nserve as a draw for researchers, scientists, students and individuals seeking \ntreatment.  \n \nGiven that stem cell research is at the forefront of medicine, much remains to \nbe  learned.  This  is  a  field  where  the  promise  and  effectiveness  of  new \ntreatments are sometimes exaggerated by those looking to capitalize on hype \nand sell treatments to the desperately ill. The Center would be an upstanding \nentity performing research to understand and advance stem cell therapies in a \nresponsible manner, translating science into safe and effective treatments. \n \nWhen I was a Senator, I had stem cell bills that were worked on over the years. \nI have been able to travel the Country and the world to visit stem cell clinics. I \nhave  seen  the  opportunity  world-class  stem  cells  provide.  This  will  change \nhealth care in Nevada. This type of medicine will create a medical tourism hub \nfor Las Vegas. \n \nBUDDHADEB DAWN, M.D. (Nevada Stem Cell Center): \nI am in support of S.B. 363. I have provided the Nevada Stem Cell Center \nProposal (Exhibit Q), proposed Organizational Chart (Exhibit R) and testimony in \nsupport (Exhibit S). I also have a presentation of testimony with a slide show \nexplaining the aspects of a stem cell (Exhibit T). \n \nStem cells are special types of cells which have the ability to replenish their \nown store; to self-replicate and generate new cells from the cells in the body \nwhich are in different tissues.  \n \nWe have attempted to use stem cells for therapy since 1992. During this time, \nwe  have  seen  scientific  attempts  to  utilize  many  different  types  of  cells  in \nclinical trials such as bone marrow and umbilical cord blood. The results have \nbeen  variable  with  different  types  of  cells  with  different  disease  entities. \nConsistent with the increasing number of cells that have been used for therapy \nand the number of diseases for which stem cells have been applied, the list has \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2019 \nPage 25 \n \ngrown  significantly  over  the  last  15-20  years.  They  include  heart  attacks, \nstrokes, critical limb ischemia, cancer and bone marrow transplants. Variable \namounts of success have been gained from this treatment. \n \nAs a cardiologist, I would like to explain how stem cells would work for the \nheart. When an artery is blocked, the part of the heart that is supplied by the \nartery loses the muscle, or that part of the heart dies. After the heart attack, the \nheart  will  continue  to  dilate  and  the  area  covered  by  heart  muscle  is  now \ncovered  by  a  scar.  This  scar  is  unable  to  contract.  Twenty  years  ago  the \nconcept was that if we inject stem cells in and around the scar it would make \nnew muscle, or would otherwise strengthen the heart to more efficiently pump \nand improve patient symptoms.  \n \nThis is accomplished in humans in many different ways. A catheter is advanced \nthrough the artery into the area where the occlusion was; the part of the heart \nwhere the muscle was lost. We open it up with a balloon to stop blood flow and \ninject cells through the catheter to the damaged area of the heart. Another way \nto inject cells would be when the chest is open. Cells could be loaded in a \nsyringe and injected in and around the scar. They can also be injected through a \nvein.  \n \nThere have been more than 80 studies completed worldwide for heart disease \nalone  using  bone  marrow  cells.  However,  some  of  the  trials  have  been \ninconclusive due to the low number of patients. It has been our privilege to \nenlighten  people  in  this  area  and  we  have  published  several  papers  on  the \nsubject. The last one was in the American Heart Association Journal where we \nanalyzed  data  from  48  randomized  clinical  trials  from  2,600  patients.  Our \nanalysis showed heart function improved by over 3 percent, and the scar tissue \nwas smaller by over 2 percent. \n \nOne may ask, what is the benefit to the patient from these small numbers of \nimprovement? This is where the importance of science and data analysis is \nrelevant.  Our  analysis  showed  the  outcome  of  those  patients  improved \ntremendously with the risk of death decreasing by 45 percent, and the risks of \nrecurrent heart attack, stroke and arrhythmias decreasing significantly. \n \nThe  importance  of  scientific  data  in  this  field  caught  between  undue \nexpectations and optimum results creates the need for academic environment \nand scientific rigor to cell therapy operations. With this approach, we can select \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2019 \nPage 26 \n \nappropriate patient populations most likely to benefit. We can select appropriate \ncell types on their scientific merit. We can optimize the cell processing, follow \npatient outcomes, analyze data and through research, be able to discover new \ncell therapy approaches. \n \nThis will be my third attempt at forming a Stem Cell Program. I founded the \nStem  Cell  Program  at  the  University  of  Louisville.  As  the  founding  Director \nbetween 2013 and 2018, I founded the Midwest Stem Cell Therapy Center at \nthe University of Kentucky. I see huge potential with this Nevada Stem Cell \nCenter if approved. I have had long-standing interest in mentoring, and there are \nextensive opportunities to collaborate within UNLV, as well as externally. \n \nWhy invest in a Stem Cell Center? This will bring cutting-edge clinical trials \nbeing done across the Country not readily available to Nevadans. It will help \nlocal  investigators  begin  stem  cell  trials.  The  Center  will  be  able  to  locally \nproduce high-quality stem cells for delivery to patients. There will be research \nfocused  on  identifying  new  cells  and  novel  targets  for  different  stem  cell \napproaches. Through education, we will promote awareness and disseminate \nscientific  information  dispelling  some  of  the  myths  surrounding  stem  cell \nscience. \n \nIn conclusion, stem cells are the future of medicine. There are approximately \n200 Investigational New Drugs (IND) projected to be submitted to the Food and \nDrug Administration in 2020 and there are a large number of IND currently \npending.  If  we  are  able  to  deliver  cell  therapy  within  a  strong  academic \nenvironment  it  would  result  in  improved  outcomes.  There  is  extensive \nknowledge and expertise available locally which would potentially benefit a large \nnumber of patients in this State and adjoining states.  \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nDr. Dawn, you stated you had done stem cell research at the University of \nLouisville Medical School. How long ago was that?  \n \nDR. DAWN: \nI was employed there between 2001 and 2009. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThe University of Louisville Medical School received a $13.1 million grant. What \nwas the outcome, and where are they today? \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2019 \nPage 27 \n \nDR. DAWN: \nThat grant was secured after I left the University. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nSome of us are sensitive to fetal stem cells. You stated there will be no retrieval \nfrom aborted remains. Is this correct? \n \nDR. DAWN: \nI have never worked with fetal or embryonic cells and that will not be done at \nthe Center. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI  am  curious  about  the  choice  of  the  bill  directing  the  formation  of  an \nindependent,  stand-alone  501(c)(3)  charitable  nonprofit.  Was  that  the  model \nused at the two prior universities with which you were affiliated? It sounds as \nthough they were a department or a program within the University. Why would \nwe use NRS statute to set up an independent nonprofit as opposed to funding a \nprogram at a university? \n \nDR. DAWN: \nIn Kansas, the Midwest Stem Cell Therapy Center was part of the university. \nWith my experience in leading that Center, I believe this model would be nimble \nand have excellent guidance through an Executive Board. The difference was \nthe Midwest Stem Cell Therapy Center had an Advisory Board, not an Executive \nBoard. With an Executive Board including members from the Legislature, as well \nas  local  governing  authorities,  it  would  give  more  flexibility  to  the  Center's \noperations which would be necessary for clinical operations, as well as other \nactivities of the Center. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThe  University  of  Louisville,  School  of  Medicine  sometimes  does  things  in \nconjunction with the Jewish Hospital in Kentucky. Were they connected at all, \nor was it a stand-alone therapeutic center? \n \nDR. DAWN:  \nThe research I did at the University of Louisville did not have a stem cell center. \nWe  built  a  stem  cell  program  which  focused  on  research  and  subsequently \ndeveloped clinical trials from there. It was not organized or funded as a center. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2019 \nPage 28 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIs the Executive Board going to be subject to the Open Meeting Law? Is it \nchoosing to use State General Fund money? \n \nDR. DAWN: \nI am not the appropriate person to ask this question. I would defer to someone \nmore knowledgeable. \n \nSENATOR WOODHOUSE: \nI do not have an answer for that. I will work with our legal staff to determine \nthe proper way to handle that question. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nMr. Robbins, would this Executive Board be subject to the Open Meeting Law? \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nThe  Open  Meeting  Law  applies  to  any  public  body  which  is  defined  in \nNRS 241.015 to mean: \n \nAny administrative advisory, executive or legislative body of the \nState or local government consisting of at least two persons which \nexpends or disburses or is supported in whole or in part by tax \nrevenue … \n \nUnder that definition, unless it is expressly exempt from the Open Meeting Law, \nthe Open Meeting Law would apply. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nIf they started to receive funding from other sources besides the State General \nFunds,  would  they  still  be  needing  to  follow  the  Open  Meeting  Law?  I  am \nthinking of the long list of nonprofits for which we donate grants through The \nFund for a Healthy Nevada where they have a portion of their money coming \nfrom tax dollars or other government sources and are not subject to the Open \nMeeting Law. \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nThe definition states a public body is \"…any Body supported in whole, or in \npart, by tax revenue.\" If there is any State General Fund money provided, it \nwould be subject to the Open Meeting Law. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2019 \nPage 29 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAre there any other examples within NRS where we have created a stand-alone, \nindependent, 501(c)(3) nonprofit where we are compelling the president of a \nuniversity and members of the Legislature to sit on the board of that nonprofit \nand become trustees of that nonprofit? \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nI do not have an answer for that, but I will look into it for you. \n \nMELISSA CLEMENT (Nevada Right to Life): \nNevada Right to Life supports S.B. 363.  \n \nUmbilical stem cell banks had just come about when I was pregnant with my \nfirst child. It is amazing what our medical field is able to do with these stem \ncells.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 363 and turn the hearing over to Vice Chair \nSpearman. \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nI will open the hearing on S.B. 456. \n \nSENATE BILL 456: Revises provisions relating to staff privileges for advanced \npractice registered nurses at hospitals. (BDR 40-786) \n \nSENATOR JULIA RATTI (Senatorial District No. 13): \nI am here to present S.B. 456 for your consideration. Nevada faces a severe \nshortage of health care providers. Two out of every three Nevadans live in an \narea designated by the Federal government as having a shortage of primary \nmedical care providers. More than 9 in 10 Nevadans, 95 percent of the State's \npopulation, live in a federally designated mental health profession shortage area. \nThese statistics are even more sobering in rural Nevada. \n \nOne approach to improve access to care is to rely on mid-level health providers \nsuch  as  advanced  practice  registered  nurses  (APRNs)  for  more  services.  In \nNevada,  APRNs,  including  certified  nurse-midwives  (CNMs),  can  currently \npractice independently, which reduces the need to rely solely on physicians and \ncan help State residents obtain medical care. However, mid-level providers are \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2019 \nPage 30 \n \noften  reimbursed  at  a  lower  rate  than  physicians  for  providing  the  same \nservices.  \n \nThe 2010 Affordable Care Act aimed to address a piece of this problem by \nincreasing reimbursement rates for CNMs to 100 percent of the amount paid to \nphysicians  for  the  same  procedures.  While  a  higher  reimbursement  rate  is \navailable, we have seen very few nurse-midwives who are licensed in Nevada, \nin  part,  because  without  hospital  privileges  they  cannot  admit  patients  or \npractice independently in a hospital setting. \n \nSenate Bill 456 addresses this problem by authorizing hospitals to grant APRNs \nprivileges to work in their facilities. Our hope is this change will encourage more \nCNMs to practice in Nevada.  \n \nMS. KOTCHEVAR: \nSection 1 is language very similar to how a dentist can be admitted for hospital \nprivileges. It states \"A hospital may admit an advanced practice registered nurse \nto  membership  on  the  medical  staff  of  the  hospital  to  perform  any  act \nauthorized pursuant to NRS 632.237.\" \n \nThis basically states they can work within their approved scope of practice. \nSection 1, subsection 1 states a hospital shall not automatically admit them, \nmeaning they can set criteria for any professional on their staff. It also cannot \ndeny them based on the fact they are APRNs as opposed to another provider \ntype. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIs  this  limited  to  nurse-midwifes  working  in  intensive  care  units  or  doing \nsurgery?  Or  are  you  opening  it  up  to  all  hospital  privileges  knowing \nnurse-midwives  traditionally  do  not  train  in  hospitals  and  do  not  have  the \nknowledge of other areas of the hospital? \n \nMS. KOTCHEVAR: \nIt does limit it to the scope of practice and training of the midwife. What they \nare trained to do, and what they are licensed to do, will be the limit of the \nprivileges; however, the hospital cannot automatically deny anyone. Midwives \nneed to demonstrate they are qualified. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2019 \nPage 31 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nAre there any nurse practitioners who have in-hospital care training programs \nother than nurse-midwives? Do they have nurse-midwives training in hospitals \nanywhere that we know? \n \nMS. KOTCHEVAR: \nI do not have an answer for that, but I can ask the APRN and the State Board of \nNursing and get back to you. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nHave any nurse-midwifes ever done a C-section? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nWe can go to the licensing board and check on the scope of practice. I do not \nbelieve this is our intent. We are highlighting the nurse-midwife. We are seeing \nbarriers to entry where we are trying to expand the number of practitioners \nwhere there are shortages. There are no additional examples that have come to \nmy attention. The language is broadly written. We will do some work with the \nlicensing board to ask those questions. \n \nMS. KOTCHEVAR: \nWhile we have seen a growth in APRNs, there are 5 licensed nurse-midwives \nout of 1,500, and 1 of those 5 is practicing. This has been an area where more \nwomen are asking to use midwives. They become limited to a home birth which \nmay not be safe. We are looking to try to meet that need for women. \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nSection 4, subsection 2, paragraph (a) and section 4, subsection 3, paragraph \n(b) speak to regulations the board will adopt and addresses things with respect \nto rural hospitals, substance abuse and residential facilities. I am unsure if the \nquestions Senator Hardy asked are covered under that. If it does not, maybe \nthere are word changes we need to look at. \n \nMS. KOTCHEVAR: \nWhat we need to look at is whether NRS 632 limits their scope of practice, and \nif it is defined well enough. Perhaps we need to include more criteria for a \nhospital to use when adding nurse-midwives. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2019 \nPage 32 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nAre there hospitals ready to accept this legislation? \n \nMS. KOTCHEVAR: \nWe  would  have  to  ask  the  hospitals.  I  believe  it  certainly  provides  an \nopportunity to meet the needs of the people they are serving. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThere are people who are enthusiastic about seeing the number of patients \nseeking home births have the opportunity to be transferred to a facility when it \nis appropriate or, desired by the patient, should something unexpected happen. \nThere is a general understanding this will improve the health, safety and options \nfor patients.  \n \nCHELSEA CAPURRO (Nevada Advanced Practice Nurses Association): \nNevada Advanced Practice Nurses Association supports S.B. 456. Other than \njust Certified Nurse Midwives, we have had APRNs seeking hospital privileges \nwho are doctorally trained relating to mental health. One of the barriers is they \nmust have a collaborating physician which State law does not require.  \n \nVeterans  Affairs  (VA)  hospitals  give  APRNs  hospital  privileges.  Forty-one \npercent of APRNs across the Country have hospital privileges. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWhat are their hospital privileges in the VA hospitals? \n \nMS. CAPURO: \nI will research this and get back to you. There are many APRNs practicing in \nother areas, other than just nurse-midwives, that would be interested in this. \n \nMELINDA HOSKINS (Nevada Affiliate of the American College of Nurse-Midwives): \nThe Nevada Affiliate of the American College of Nurse-Midwives is in support of \nS.B. 456. I am a CNM and took my training in a hospital. As nurse-midwives, \nwe provide care in hospital and clinical settings. I have chosen my path by \nproviding home-birth services in northern Nevada, and it would be great to have \nhospital privileges.  \n \nThe year our autonomous practice went into effect in Nevada was in 2013. The \nBoard of Trustees of Carson Tahoe Regional Medical Center voted they would \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2019 \nPage 33 \n \nonly allow applications to the medical staff if the APRN was employed by a \nphysician who was already a medical staff member. I have been unable to apply \nfor privileges.  \n \nIn  the  last  year,  I  have  had  two  clients  for  home  birth  who  needed  to  be \ntransferred to the hospital. One case involved a client who was experiencing \npain due to the position of her baby. She had an epidural with her first baby and \nwanted another. The physicians were gracious, obliged her with an epidural and \nshe had her baby. The second case involved a young woman having her third \nbaby. Her membranes released and her labor did not start. At 24 hours, we \nthought it wise to go to the hospital. I accompanied her and again, was received \ngraciously by the staff and within six hours she had her baby. \n \nI previously worked at a birth center in Santa Rosa, California, where I had \nhospital privileges and would have been able to take both of those patients \nmanaging  their  care  without  inconveniencing  the  physicians.  I  had  a  good \nrelationship with the nursing staff there. \n \nWe have 36 nurse-midwives in this State. I believe at least 28 are working in \nhospital settings where they are providing birth services. Because they are not \nmembers of the medical staff, their names do not appear on the face sheets of \nthe mothers admitted to the hospital. If you were to scroll through the providers \nwho are on the birth certificate list, those attending a birth, at least two-thirds \nof  those  28  midwives  do  not  appear  on  that  list.  Their  names  are  never \nrecognized as being the provider attending a birth. This means the statistics of \nAPRN attended births are inaccurate. The birth certificate clerk at the hospital \nuses the name of the physician on the face sheet of the patient's admitting \nrecord.  \n \nCommercial insurance companies are unable to credential me. I do not have \nhospital privileges and am unable to be an approved, credentialed provider for \nmany  of  the  insurance  companies.  This  limits  my  practice  to  the  Medicaid \npatients  who  can  afford  to  pay  my  fee  in  cash  or  those  who  have  a \nhigh-deductible Health Savings Plan to provide for the birth.  \n \nLYNN ANDERSON (Nevada Affiliate of the American College of Nurse Midwives): \nI support S.B. 456. I am a doctorally prepared Nurse Practitioner, CNM and \nAPRN. I have had hospital privileges at the only two local hospitals in Reno that \nprovide birth services; St. Mary's Women's Health Center and Renown Regional \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2019 \nPage 34 \n \nMedical  Center.  I  have  worked  in  large  medical  groups  and  had  wonderful \ncollaborating  physicians.  I  am  credentialed  under  a  Strategic  Planning \nProfessional designation. I do not hold voting privileges on the medical staff and \nam not authorized to admit patients under my name, although I have attended \nthousands of births in the community. \n \nAbout a year-and-a-half ago, a local area hospital closed our medical practice \nalong with six physicians and three midwives. Our patients were relocated to \nother practices; some of whom I had attended births for two or three prior \npregnancies.  They  were  displaced  in  their  seventh  and  eighth  months  of \npregnancy. Because I no longer had a collaborating physician, a midwife partner \nand I intended to start a private practice to treat and transition these women. \nWe were unable to establish a relationship with a local physician to collaborate \nwith so we were unable to open the practice.  \n \nBeing unable to collaborate with a physician also sets up a condition of vicarious \nliability. We are autonomous practitioners. We are responsible for the care we \nprovide  our  patients.  The  physicians  I  collaborate  with  in  no  way  assume \nresponsibility for my actions because I am an independent practitioner.  \n \nI  am  currently  employed  as  the  Assistant  Professor  of  Obstetrics  and \nGynecology  at  the  University  of  Nevada,  Reno  School  of  Medicine.  I  teach \nthird-year  medical  students  and  supervise  senior  resident  family  practice \nresident physicians in the area of birth. They value my expertise; therefore, I am \npermitted to supervise physicians, yet I have no admitting privileges. My name \ncannot be on the admission orders. I have to find a physician to do that. In \nmany  cases,  it  may  be  a  family  practice  attending  faculty  member  or  an \nobstetrician-gynecologist who know nothing about the patient or the care that \nhas been given.  \n \nMARLENE LOCKARD (Nevada Chiropractic Association): \nThe Nevada Chiropractic Association supports S.B. 456 and access to health \ncare. We believe all health care providers should be able to practice within their \nscope, training and education.  \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThis bill is about access to care. I ask you to support S.B. 456. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2019 \nPage 35 \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 456 and return the hearing to Chair Ratti. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe Committee received information with regard to S.B. 370 on Fetal Alcohol \nSpectrum Disorders and the Foster Care System (Exhibit U). \n \nSeeing no further business, this hearing is adjourned at 6:28 p.m. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRemainder of page intentionally left blank; signature page to follow.   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2019 \nPage 36 \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nVickie Polzien, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2019 \nPage 37 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nExhibit / \nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \n# of pages \n  A  1    Agenda \n  B  9    Attendance Roster \nS.B. 94  C  2  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 179  D  2  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 228  E  23  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nTrista Miller / Tuck and Run \nS.B. 266  F  1  Testimony of Support \nFoundation \nJulie Murray / Nevada \nS.B. 266  G  2  Testimony of Support \nMedical Center \nS.B. 315  H  1  Connor Cain / PhRMA  Letter of Support \nTom McCoy / American \nS.B. 315  I  1  Cancer Society Cancer  Testimony of Support \nAction Network \nSean McDonald / \nS.B. 315  J  1  Department of Motor  Testimony in Neutral \nVehicles \nKelly Venci Gonzalez / Legal \nS.B. 370  K  2  Aid Center of Southern  Testimony of Support \nNevada \nS.B. 370  L  1  Jennifer Robertson  Testimony of Support \nS.B. 370  M  1  Heather Morris  Testimony of Support \nS.B. 370  N  1  Geoffrey Simmons  Testimony of Support \nS.B. 370  O  1  Holly Summers  Testimony of Support \nProposed Amendment \nS.B.370  P  1  Senator James Ohrenschall \nNVAHP \nBuddhadeb Dawn, M.D. / \nS.B. 363  Q  8  NSCC Proposal \nNevada Stem Cell Center \nBuddhadeb Dawn, M.D. / \nS.B. 363   R  1  Proposed Organizational Chart \nNevada Stem Cell Center \nBuddhadeb Dawn, M.D. / \nS.B. 363  S  2  Testimony of Support \nNevada Stem Cell Center \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2019 \nPage 38 \n \nBuddhadeb Dawn, M.D. /  Presentation of Testimony of \nS.B. 363  T  14 \nNevada Stem Cell Center  Support \nNational Organization on  FASD and the Foster Care \nS.B. 370  U  1 \nFetal Alcohol Syndrome  System Flyer \n ", "26": "\nMINUTES OF THE  \nSENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n \nEightieth Session \nApril 3, 2019 \n \n \nThe Senate Committee on Health and Human Services was called to order by \nChair Julia Ratti at 4:12 p.m. on Wednesday, April 3, 2019, in Room 2135 of \nthe  Legislative  Building,  Carson City,  Nevada.

(BDR 40-111) \n \nSENATOR JULIA RATTI (Senatorial District No. 13): \nI would like to introduce Katie and Luke Anderson, the family who brought to \nmy  attention  the  need  for  this  bill  and  made  me  interested  in  newborn \nscreening.  \n \nWhen the Anderson family received a life-changing diagnosis, they reached out \nto me about newborn screening. What I learned about the newborn screening \nprocess was that Nevada had fallen behind in keeping up with best practices. \nMy first inclination was to add this one condition that you will hear about to the \nnewborn screening process. However, there is already a public health system \nbuilt around newborn screening and there are some pretty good Nationwide \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 3, 2019 \nPage 3 \n \nprocesses in place. There is a uniform process where decisions are made as to \nwhich conditions belong on the newborn screening panel.  \n \nThe condition we are going to talk about today is on the Recommended Uniform \nScreening  Panel  (RUSP).  However,  Nevada  has  not  followed  those  best \npractices and recommendations and did not screen for that condition. Nevada \nneeds  to  improve  its  best  practices  and  make  sure  the  newborn  screening \nprocess is as strong as it can be.  \n \nKATIE ANDERSON: \nMy name is Katie Anderson and this is my eldest son Luke. Our eight-year-old \nson Ben was diagnosed March 9, 2018, with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy \n(ALD) (Exhibit C). By then, Ben's brain was already past the point of all possible \nmedical treatments. Following Ben's diagnosis our older son Luke was tested, \nand we learned that he also has X-linked ALD, but not the cerebral form.  \n \nHad  there  been  a  newborn  screening  for  X-linked  ALD,  we  would  have \nimmediately known about Luke immediately and we would have also been able \nto  make  an  informed  decision  about  having  a  second  child.  Conceptually, \nnewborn screening could eliminate the spreading of these types of diseases to \nfuture generations.  \n \nSENATOR WOODHOUSE: \nThank you for sharing your story. It is important for the Legislature to know \nwhat is going on in its communities so it can make things right for families in \nthe future.  \n \nTRUDY LARSON, PH.D. (Dean, School of Community Health Sciences, University \nof Nevada, Reno): \nI  oversee  the  Nevada  Newborn  Screening  Program  (NNSP).  The  NNSP  was \nstarted  in  the  1990s  primarily  to  deal  with  phenylketonuria  (PKU).  Early \nrecognition of PKU with a special diet would offer a normal life for children who \nhad this genetic condition.  \n \nThe screening was originally done by the Oregon State Public Health Laboratory \nuntil  2014,  when  the  program  moved  to  the  Nevada  State  Public  Health \nLaboratory. Currently, the NNSP screens for 57 conditions and recently added \nsevere combined immunodeficiency syndrome (SCID). A fatal disease early in \ninfancy, SCID can be cured with a bone marrow transplant. The availability of \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 3, 2019 \nPage 4 \n \ntreatment  is  just  one  measure  used  to  recommend  genetic  conditions  for \nscreening. There is a briefing paper (Exhibit D) by the United States Department \nof  Health  and  Human  Services  outlining  how  their  advisory  committee  of \nexperts recommend screening tests. The outcome is the RUSP Core Conditions, \n(Exhibit E).  \n \nEach genetic condition brought forward for inclusion is thoroughly investigated \nwith  four  overarching  considerations.  To  be  included  as  a  primary  target \ncondition, the genetic condition must meet four conditions in Exhibit D. Each \nstate is responsible for selecting its own screening list based on a number of \nfactors.  Nevada  screens  for  all  but  three  of  the  RUSP  conditions.  These \nthree conditions  are  mucopolysaccharidosis  type  1,  X-linked  ALD  and  spinal \nmuscular atrophy.  \n \nThese  are  all  conditions  where  an  enzyme  does  not  work  and  there  is  an \naccumulation of material that causes destruction or where enough protein is not \nproduced. These are all genetic conditions. We do not measure genes or look at \ngene mutations. We look at whether the accumulation of these materials in the \nblood are abnormal.  \n \nThe impetus for S.B. 291 and most revisions around newborn screening are \nrequests from families who have been impacted by genetic conditions not on \nthe RUSP. As this applies to Nevada, S.B. 291 would add the three conditions \nto the NNSP already approved by the Federal Advisory Group. Nevada has the \nAdvisory Committee on Heritable Disorders and Genetic Diseases in Newborns \nand Children (ACHDNC) composed of physicians with expertise in these genetic \ndisorders, nurses, hospitals and support agencies. The ACHDNC has already \nrecommended all RUSP conditions. Inherent in this action is the need to identify \nadequate resources to support the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up.  \n \nTo support the NNSP, fees are collected from birthing hospitals and sites that \nare mandated to obtain specimens from every newborn. The current fee covers \ntwo testing screens. The first test is between 24 and 48 hours after birth and \nthe second test is 2 weeks later. To add the tests for these three conditions \nwould bring Nevada up to federal standards, but would require an increase in \nfees. Senate Bill 291 identifies a mechanism that will allow transparency in the \ndevelopment of increased fees and puts in place a means to delay adding tests \nif resources will not permit it. That is not just resources to do the test, it would \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 3, 2019 \nPage 5 \n \ninclude  resources  to  fund  physician  experts  who  can  provide  the  necessary \ntreatment for those children.  \n \nThe  NNSP  believes  it  is  important  for  Nevada  to  keep  up  with  federally \nrecommended  screenings  and  put  in  place  a  mechanism  to  assist  in  this \nprocess. I have included a chart (Exhibit F) showing the number of conditions \nfound since the start of newborn screening in Nevada. Of the 158,434 babies \nwho have been screened, 235 critical conditions have been identified, allowing \nfamilies to benefit from early diagnoses and treatments. Nevada is growing in \nnumbers and resources and it needs to extend these options to all families.  \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThe easy path for this bill would be to just add these three conditions and \nassociated fee increases and add a fiscal note. A year from now, the national \nRUSP may add conditions putting Nevada back in the same position.  \n \nThere is also a trend where families go to Legislators with compelling stories \nand want their condition to be added to the NNSP. There are literally hundreds \nof rare disease conditions. I believe it is more effective to have a well-vetted \nnational process to determine what conditions should be added to the panel. \nThis  is  better  than  the  Legislative  Body  being  swayed  by  what  might  be \ncompelling stories to add newborn screening conditions to the panel, but they \ndo not meet the criteria for which there are not scientifically based interventions \navailable.  \n \nWhat this bill seeks to do is make the standard in Nevada to keep up with the \nRUSP. This means Nevada will continue to follow best practices, but it will put \na box or limit around it. Therefore, conditions that do not qualify for the RUSP \nwill not be added in Nevada.  \n \nI would like to refer to section 1, subsection 2, which states the State Board of \nHealth will set the standards for following the RUSP. This is important because \nMedicaid covers 55 percent of births in Nevada. For those births covered by \nMedicaid, Nevada will have to pay the increased screening fee to cover those \nconditions. Just to give you a sense of scale, the cost to add the three RUSP \nconditions  is  about  $500,000.  Senate  Bill  291  has  two  important  escape \nclauses.  An  example  of  the  first  escape  clause  would  be  a  condition  was \nincluded on the RUSP, but the cost was exorbitant. If the RUSP adds the new \ncondition, and the amount of resources it would take for the Nevada State \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 3, 2019 \nPage 6 \n \nPublic Health Laboratory (NSPHL) to keep up with that condition was too much, \nthe State Board of Health would be able to opt out Nevada.  \n \nThe second escape clause is if the Director of the NSPHL or the Chief Medical \nOfficer believes the resources are not available in the community to provide the \nsupport for the families to work with the diagnoses. This would also give the \nState Board of Health the ability to opt out Nevada.  \n \nThe third part of S.B. 291 is a four-year lag. This gives Nevada four years from \nthe  time  the  condition  is  added  to  the  RUSP  to  determine  lab  costs  and \nresources. It requires Nevada hold a public hearing where Dr. Larson or her \nsuccessor justify the rate increase. The four-year window will give Medicaid and \nall other payers and providers the opportunity to plan for the future.  \n \nRight now our newborn screening process is stuck in time. The current rate is \n$81 and that amount has not changed since Nevada adopted the program from \nOregon. The NSPHL is housed at the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR). The \nPresident of UNR has the sole authority to raise fees. Currently, they could \nchoose to raise fees and/or add conditions, but there is no public process or \nframework about how to do that. This puts the President of UNR in an awkward \nposition. I am not sure he wants to make those decisions. This bill brings this \nback to the State Board of Health in consultation with Medicaid in regard to the \nfee, and gives Nevada a standard to follow. This biennium, Nevada will need to \nspend  about  $500,000  to  get  caught  up  by  the  addition  of  these \nthree conditions. However, as new conditions come up, there is a process to \nadopt them, which does not freeze the newborn screening process in time at \nthe $81 rate.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI assume the lag time does not exist for the first three conditions. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThe bill states Nevada will do this within four years and these conditions will be \nadded  within  four  years.  The  intent  would  be  to  act  immediately  on  these \nthree conditions and then have four years for any new conditions.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIs there an advantage to moving this back to Oregon? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 3, 2019 \nPage 7 \n \nMS. LARSON: \nNo. We have been able to improve service to the community. The results get \nback 24 hours faster than they did from Oregon. I believe doing this in-state \nprovides greater service.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nDid we save money by moving it to Nevada? \n \nMS. LARSON: \nThe fee was $81 when Nevada brought it over. Oregon was raising the rate $2 \nevery year, and that was going out-of-state.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWe need to do this sooner, rather than later. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nIn closing, I just want to let the Committee know we have been working with \nrepresentatives from hospitals, insurance companies and universities to State \nMedicaid in order to make sure functionally this would work.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nAre we allowed to see if anyone is against this before I make a motion? \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nI will open for support of S.B. 291. \n \nCATHERINE O'MARA (Nevada State Medical Association): \nWe support S.B. 291. \n \nMELINDA HOSKINS (Nevada Affiliate of the American College of Nurse-Midwives):  \nWe are in support of S.B. 291. As a home birth midwife, I have some questions \nabout  reimbursement.  This  fee  is  charged  to  us  as  providers,  but  is  not \nreimbursed by Medicaid.  \n \nTOM CLARK (Nevada Association of Health Plans):  \nMany of you might be surprised to see an insurer in support of such a mandate. \nI want to thank Senator Ratti for including a working group when drafting this \nbill. Subsection 2 of section 1 is important to us as insurers. It creates a box \nand makes the screening process predictive. We know when these types of \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 3, 2019 \nPage 8 \n \ntests reach the federal level where they need to be screened; we can plan when \nthey will come to the State. We are proud to support this bill.  \n \nCHELSEA CAPURRO (Health Services Coalition):  \nWe are in support of S.B. 291. It is important for us to have a standard list to \nfollow and prepare for what is coming up. This bill helps us know what we need \nto cover. If the fee is going to be increased, we will know how, why and when \nthat would occur.  \n \nBOBBETTE BOND (Culinary Health Fund): \nWe are in support of S.B. 291.  \n \nTODD INGALSBEE (Professional Firefighters of Nevada): \nWe are in support of S.B. 291. \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 291. \n \nSENATOR HARDY MOVED TO DO PASS S.B. 291. \n \nSENATOR WOODHOUSE SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will open the work session on S.B. 203. \n \nSENATE BILL 203: Revises provisions governing programs for children who are \nblind, visually impaired, deaf or hard of hearing.

(BDR 40-786) \n \nMS. COMLOSSY: \nI will read the summary of the bill from the work session document (Exhibit K). \n  \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI want to figure out the scope of work for the advanced practice registered \nnurses (APRN). For example, I do not think the APRN belongs in the hospital's \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 3, 2019 \nPage 11 \n \nintensive care unit or on the surgical unit. I think they have been trained to do \nwhat they do and they provide valuable work. I do not think it is wise to give \nflat permission for the APRN to have hospital privileges. Just because they are \nan APRN does not mean they can or cannot do things. They have to have a \nscope of practice.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nMy understanding is the enabling Legislation that allows for an APRN or any \nother licensed professional to have privileges in a hospital does not change their \nscope of practice. Their scope of practice is a combination of Nevada Revised \nStatutes (NRS), Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) and other regulatory and \nlicensing processes. The act of giving them hospital privileges would not change \ntheir scope of practice, but without those privileges they cannot perform their \nscope of practice in a hospital.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWhen we talked about the dieticians, we wanted to allow them to do something \nspecific as opposed to doing everything. The dietician was not given hospital \nprivileges to do everything. The dietician was given privileges within a scope of \npractice.  In  this  bill,  if  we  have  an  APRN  apply  for  privileges  at  a  hospital \nwithout a scope of practice, then what is there to stop an APRN from saying, \n\"I can do whatever I want, because I have privileges at the hospital.\" I believe \nwe would be remiss to give carte blanche to the APRN. According to this bill, \nthe hospital cannot say \"no\" to the APRN.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will pull S.B. 456 to get clarity on this question. I would also be open to an \namendment in the bill that states, \"Allows an APRN to work within their scope \nof practice.\"  \n \nCan we amend S.B. 456 to state, \"We give APRNs hospital privileges within \ntheir scope of practice\"? \n \nERIC ROBBINS (Committee Counsel): \nYes, we can add such an amendment. \n \n \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 3, 2019 \nPage 12 \n \nSENATOR  WOODHOUSE  MOVED  TO  AMEND  AND  DO  PASS  AS \nAMENDED S.B. 456 WITH THE CONCEPTUAL AMENDMENT PROPOSED \nBY  CHAIR  RATTI  THAT  STATES,  \"WE  GIVE  APRNS  HOSPITAL \nPRIVILEGES WITHIN THEIR SCOPE OF PRACTICE.\" \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the work session and open the hearing on S.B. 262. \n \nSENATE BILL 262: Makes various changes to provide for tracking and reporting \nof information concerning the pricing of prescription drugs for treating \nasthma. (BDR 40-55) \n \nSENATOR YVANNA D. CANCELA (Senatorial District No. 10): \nThe concept of S.B. 262 will not be unfamiliar as it mirrors S.B. No. 539 of the \n79th Session, intended to shed transparency on diabetes drugs. Senate Bill 262 \ndoes the same thing our State currently does for diabetes drugs, except for \nasthma drugs.  \n \nI  want  to  share  some  numbers  to  show  why  this  is  important.  Today \n10.4 percent  of  all  adults  and  11.5  percent  of  all  children  have  asthma  in \nNevada. In the Country, 8.1 percent of adults and 8.4 percent of children have \nasthma; Nevada is well above the national average. The No. 1 reason children \nmiss school in Nevada is asthma. When children have asthma attacks, they \ncannot attend school. When adults have asthmas attacks, they cannot go to \nwork.  \n \nAt the same time, the cost to manage this disease is expensive. In 2015, the \ncost  was  $3,266  per  person,  of  which  $1,830  went  to  drug  costs.  Most \nasthma inhaler medication formulas are not new to the market, yet they are \nexpensive. From 2013 to 2018, the cost of asthma inhalers increased about \n35 percent from an average price of $280 to $380.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 3, 2019 \nPage 13 \n \nSenate Bill 262 intends to shed light on why asthma costs have increased and \nallow for a third-party unbiased look at what is happening to asthma drug costs \nin Nevada. Similar to S.B. No. 539 of the 79th Session, S.B. 262 will require \nthe  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  (DHHS)  to  compile  a  list  of \nessential asthma medications. The DHHS will narrow the list to the essential \nasthma  medications  by  the  highest  cost  and  highest  use,  among  other \ncategories, to ensure the list captures drugs that account for the majority of \ncosts.  \n \nOnce the list is compiled, drug manufactures will report certain materials such \nas: the cost of producing the drug, the administrative expenditures, the profits \nearned  from  the  drug,  the  amount  of  financial  assistance  provided  through \nprescription  assistance  programs,  the  cost  associated  with  coupons,  the \nwholesale acquisition cost, a history of any increase in the wholesale acquisition \ncost, the aggregate amount of rebates and any additional information required \nby the DHHS. \n \nAdditionally,  manufacturers  that  have  been  subject  to  a  significant  price \nincrease within the immediately preceding two calendar years must submit an \nannual report describing the reason for the increase.  \n \nCapturing the information from the drug manufacturers alone is not sufficient. \nThe second part of S.B. 262 captures the language from S.B. No. 539 of the \n79th Session that allows for a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) to also submit \ninformation  on  asthma  medication.  That  information  will  include  the  total \namount  of  rebates  the  PBM  negotiated  with  manufacturers  during  the \nimmediately preceding calendar year, the amount of all such rebates retained by \nthe PBM and the amount of all such rebates negotiated for purchase of such \ndrugs for use by individuals with a variety of types of insurance. The bill also \nextends  the  language  of  NRS  439B.650  to  require  DHHS  to  analyze  the \ninformation submitted by drug manufacturers and PBMs to compile a report.  \n \nIt is sometimes easy to think reports or data do not create change, I want to \npoint out some highlights since the last Session.  \n \nToday it is nearly impossible to hear policymakers talk about the high cost of \ndrugs without including the cost of insulin. It has become the poster child for \nhigh-cost prescription drugs. Nevada helped sparked that movement by talking \nabout the high cost of insulin and diabetes drugs in 2017. As a result, there \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 3, 2019 \nPage 14 \n \nhave  been  market  changes  for  major  diabetes  drugs.  Manufacturers  have \nlowered the cost of some of their insulin drugs and we have seen lawmakers \nuse  Nevada's  data  to  question  the  high  cost  of  diabetes  drugs.  All  of  that \naffects the patients who deserve to know the answer as to why their drug costs \nare so expensive.  \n \nMy hope is we will have the same catalyst effect in the category of asthma \ndrugs as we have had in diabetes care.  \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nWhat  has  been  the  net  effect  of  S.B.  No.  539  of  the  79th  Session?  It  is \ntwo years later, what has been the reduction of cost in insulin? \n \nSENATOR CANCELA: \nIt is hard to measure the correlation between changes in the market and the \ntransparency  created  by  S.B.  No.  539  of  the  79th  Session.  Just  today, \ntwo PDMs announced they are going to cap the cost of insulin. I am not sure of \nthe exact markers, but I believe they are lowering the cost of insulin because of \nawareness that increased cost of insulin is a problem.  \n \nNevada now has unbiased data that show the cost of insulin has increased, \nalong with the different reasons why it increased. That data could be used to \nshape public policy discussions around the need to lower the cost of insulin. In \n2017, Nevada helped spark that conversation. Now there are questions being \nasked about insulin cost at the federal level.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs there anyone in support of S.B. 262? \n \nCHRISTI CABRERA (Nevada Conservation League): \nAs an environmental organization, the connection between pollution and public \nhealth is front and center in our work. Today, people throughout Nevada with \nlung disease such as asthma are at greater risk from air pollution. Under no \nuncertain  terms,  air  pollution  has  the  hardest  impact  on  low-income \ncommunities and communities of color. The American Lung Association gave \nClark and Washoe Counties an \"F\" for ozone and particulate pollution in its \nState of the Air report. Far too many Nevadans are facing an added risk for \nasthma from air pollution. We support S.B. 262.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 3, 2019 \nPage 15 \n \nRUDY ZAMORA (League of Conservation Voters):  \nI  am  here  on  behalf  of  Chispa  Nevada,  a  program  within  the  League  of \nConservation  Voters  focused  specifically  on  communities  of  color  and \nlow-income  families  in  southern  Nevada.  As  previously  stated,  Clark  and \nWashoe Counties received an \"F\" for air quality. More than 1 in 12 kids in our \nState suffer from asthma, including my own 4-year-old son, William. Due to my \nwork and service in the community, I know thousands of other families are \nsuffering from asthma as well.  \n \nIt has been painful to watch my child suffer debilitating asthma attacks. They \nput him in the hospital for days at a time. Just a few weeks ago, my son almost \ndied  when  he  went  into  respiratory  failure  and  cardiac  arrest.  For  the  first \n24 hours in the hospital, we were uncertain if he had suffered any long-term \neffects. I want my son to run and play and live a normal life.  \n \nThese lifesaving medications are the only thing that will allow my son to live a \nclose to normal life. He needs them to breath. For low-income families and \ncommunities of color these medications can become a burden. My son is on \nthree different types of medications to control his asthma. I am fortunate to \nhave  employer-provided  insurance  that  helps  cover  the  cost  of  those \nmedications. However, not everyone can afford $80 a month after insurance for \nthese medications. Families without insurance can see up-front costs of $500 a \nmonth, and that does not include hospitalization or first responder costs. We \nsupport S.B. 262. \n \nMS. CAPURRO: \nOn behalf of the Health Services Coalition, we support S.B. 262.  \n \nPRAVEEN JAYAKUMAR (Culinary Health Fund): \nI am a primary care physician and a Medical Director with the Culinary Health \nFund. I am here to testify about asthma and how to manage it (Exhibit L). This \nis why I am in support of S.B. 262.  \n \nJOSEPH DOUGLAS (Culinary Union): \nI am 12 years old and have had asthma since I was 7 years old (Exhibit M). I \nsupport S.B. 262. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 3, 2019 \nPage 16 \n \nMR. CLARK: \nI  am  here  on  behalf  of  Nevada  Association  of  Health  Plans  and  we  are  in \nsupport of S.B. 262. \n \nMR. INGALSBEE: \nI am here on behalf of the Professional Firefighters of Nevada and we are in \nsupport of S.B. 262. Firefighters receive numerous calls for kids and adults with \nasthma. Many of them cannot afford the medication they need and we provide \nthem temporary relief. Sometimes we go back several times that day to provide \nthis medication.  \n \nJIM SULLIVAN (Culinary Union): \nWe are in support of this bill, because it brings down the cost of health care. \nThis issue is important to our union, because every dollar we have to spend on \nhealth care when negotiating contracts, comes out of wages, retirement and \npensions.  \n \nCRYSTAL MUNOZ (Culinary Union): \nI have had asthma since I was 7 years old. It is expensive to take care of my \nfamily's  asthma  (Exhibit  N).  I  support  S.B.  262  and  increased  transparency \nregarding the price of asthma medicine.  \n \nSTACIE SASSO (Health Services Coalition): \nThe Health Services Coalition represents 25 employer and union self-funded \nhealth  plans  and  roughly  280,000  lives  in  southern  Nevada.  Asthma  is  an \nexpensive disease and any transparency on the prescription drugs these patients \nhave to pay is appreciated.  \n \nMS. BOND: \nTwo years ago when we worked on the diabetes legislation, what we heard \nfrom the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) was \nNevada would run out of drugs, manufacturers would stop selling insulin to \nNevada, diabetes treatment would become more expensive, this would not save \nany money and they would file a lawsuit. I believe PhRMA got the last part \nright.  \n \nI want to remind the Committee several things happen when transparency gets \ngoing.  Several  other  states  have  introduced  similar  legislation.  Diabetes  and \ninsulin groups have grown. Eli Lilly and Company recently announced they are \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 3, 2019 \nPage 17 \n \ncutting  the  price  of  Humalog  insulin  in  half  because  they  are  introducing  a \ngeneric insulin, and two manufacturers are going to create a product that has a \n$25 a month insulin cost. We have good data reporting on diabetes by DHHS.  \n \nRAYMOND MCALLISTER (Nevada State AFL-CIO): \nWe have 200,000 members and most of them belong to health insurance trust \nfunds that purchase these supplies. There are a lot of bills that will make little \ndifference in the lives of most people. There was an opportunity last Session \nwith diabetes medication to make a real difference in people's lives. This is \nanother one of those opportunities where you can provide transparency and \nstart a path of better access to health care for the residents of this State.  \n \nCHAD NEANOVER (Culinary Union): \nI have asthma. I was born premature, with one and a half lungs. At birth, my \nhalf lung was collapsed and I weighed one pound, nine ounces. Throughout my \nchildhood, I was in the hospital at least once a week every month. I have never \nknown life without asthma. I did not have health insurance from the ages of \n18 to 29 years old. I could not afford to get treatment for my asthma. I took \nover-the-counter  medications  and  was  not  able  to  keep  my  asthma  under \ncontrol. If I had an asthma attack, I would go to the hospital, but I would not be \nable to pay the $500 emergency visit copay, nor the extra cost for x-rays. I \nwent to Tijuana to get three inhalers for under $20. In my twenties, I woke up \nin the emergency room. It was the most worried I have ever seen my wife. A \nfew months later, I had a big bill from the hospital. There were times I was \nworking two jobs and still had to forego my asthma treatments because we had \nto pay bills. We had to take care of not only my illness, but my wife's illness. I \nsupport S.B. 262 and increased transparency.  \n \nBYRON CHACON (Culinary Union; translator Nelson Lucero): \nByron Chacon's testimony in English (Exhibit O) is in support of S.B. 262.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs there anyone here in opposition to S.B. 262? \n \nROCKY FINSETH (PhRMA): \nI am here on behalf of PhRMA and we are opposed to S.B. 262. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 3, 2019 \nPage 18 \n \nASHER LISEC (PhRMA): \nI am the Policy Director for PhRMA. We are opposed to S.B. 262 which expands \nthe insulin transparency bill to include asthma medications. PhRMA understands \nthe discussions about the costs and affordability of medications is important. \nHowever, PhRMA thinks transparency conversations need to be meaningful and \nprovide information about what the consumer pays for the medicine (Exhibit P). \nWe  think  this  bill  could  be  significantly  improved  by  providing  transparency \nacross the entire supply chain.  \n \nOur second issue pertains to litigation that happened after S.B. No. 539 of the \n79th Session. A product of that litigation was a set of regulations providing \nprotection of proprietary information that was submitted to the DHHS. It is not \nclear whether S.B. 262 would extend those same proprietary protections to \nasthma  drugs.  We  would  ask  the  Legislature  to  consider  an  amendment  to \nadopt the regulations from S.B. No. 539 of the 79th Session into S.B. 262 to \nprovide the same proprietary protection for asthma medications.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs anyone here today to testify neutral for S.B. 262? \n \nJAY PARMER (Association for Accessible Medicines): \nThe Association for Accessible Medicines represents the generic and biosimilar \nindustry. The generic industry supports drug price transparency. Generic drugs \nreduce  costs  of  prescriptions  for  consumers  and  Medicare  and  Medicaid \nprograms. In 2005, then State Senator Dina Titus introduced a bill that became \nknown as the \"Generic Drug Utilization Act.\" Since that time, generic drugs \nhave made a significant financial impact on the State. The data we have from \n2017 show generic drugs saved the Medicaid program $370 million. Of the \nprescribed drugs for Medicaid, 82 percent were generic and they accounted for \nonly 16 percent of total drug costs. Statewide generics were 90 percent of all \nprescriptions filled, but accounted for only 24 percent of total spending. This \nequates to about $2 billion in savings for Nevada in 2017.  \n \nSUZANNE BIERMAN (Administrator, Division of Health Care Financing and Policy, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services):  \nTransparency and accountability legislation help address rising pharmaceutical \nprices (Exhibit Q). We are neutral on S.B. 262. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 3, 2019 \nPage 19 \n \nSENATOR CANCELA: \nOne in every ten Nevadans has asthma. Nevada has a higher rate of asthma \nthan the national average and it is expensive to treat the condition. We as a \nState should have neutral data to make policy decisions on this important issue. \nThis is what S.B. 262 creates.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe will close the hearing on S.B. 262 and open the hearing on S.B. 378. \n \nSENATE  BILL  378:  Revises  provisions  relating  to  the  pricing  of  prescription \ndrugs. (BDR 40-574) \n \nSENATOR CANCELA: \nSenate  Bill  378  does  a  number  of  things.  It  creates  the  Prescription  Drug \nAffordability Board, the Prescription Drug Affordability Stakeholder Council that \nwork with the Board and the Silver State Scripts Board.  \n \nThis bill is not original to Nevada; it started as an idea in Maryland. It has gotten \nthrough the Maryland House and is now in the Maryland Senate. The Maryland \nLegislative Session has not ended. Currently, we do not know what the final bill \nis or if it passed during their session.  \n \nThe reality is about one in four Nevadans struggle to deal with the high cost of \nprescription drugs. This bill is written to address that.  \n \nSection  12  of  the  bill  establishes  the  Prescription  Drug  Affordability  Board, \nwhich  consists  of  five  members,  one  each  appointed  by  the  Governor,  the \nMajority  Leader  of  the  Senate,  the  Speaker  of  the  Assembly,  the  Attorney \nGeneral and one member jointly appointed by the Majority Leader of the Senate \nand the Speaker of the Assembly. The members must have expertise in the \neconomics of health care or in the practice of clinical medicine. They must not \nbe an employee, officer, member of the executive board or a consultant of a \nmanufacturer  or  a  trade  association  for  manufacturers  as  defined  in \nNRS 639.009.  \n \nEach of the appointments to the Board must reflect the ethnic and geographic \ndiversity of the State. Before being appointed, appointees must disclose any \npotential conflicts of interest that may create a bias or the appearance of bias in \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 3, 2019 \nPage 20 \n \nmatters related to the duties of the Board. Members can receive a salary of \n$80 per day, as well as per diem and travel expenses.  \n \nSection 13 prescribes the requirement governing the procedures of the Board. \nThe Board must meet every six weeks or at the call of the Chair. It allows for \nthe  Board  to  close  any  portion  of  the  meeting  to  consider  proprietary \ninformation  around  a  prescription  drug.  It  prohibits  members  from  accepting \nfinancial benefits that exceed $5,000 per year from manufacturers or related \npeople and entities. It prohibits the Board members, employees and independent \ncontractors from accepting gifts or donations that could lead to a conflict of \ninterest. It requires members to disclose conflicts of interest within five days of \nidentifying the conflict.  \n \nSection 14 says the Board may appoint an Executive Director, General Counsel \nand other employees of the Board as needed. \n \nSection 15 creates the Prescription Drug Affordability Stakeholder Council. This \ngroup has less appointment restrictions and allows for industry representation.  \n \nSection 16 establishes the Prescription Drug Affordability Account in the State \nGeneral Fund to fund the Board. \n \nSection 17 requires the Board to impose an assessment on manufacturers that \nsell prescription drugs for distribution in the State and requires the Board to \ndeposit  those  assessments  into  the  Prescription  Drug  Affordability  Account. \nThere are two proposed amendments. The first proposed amendment (Exhibit R) \nchanges the word \"assessment\" to \"fee\" in this section.  \n \nSection 18 requires the Board to identify prescription drugs that meet certain \ncriteria. Once the Board is established, these next sections answer \"what does \nthe Board do?\" \n \nSpecifically, the Board must identify certain drugs and decide whether those \nprescription drugs should be looked at because of their costs. \n \nThe Board identifies: (1) Brand-name prescription drugs for which the wholesale \nacquisition cost is $30,000 per year or more and the wholesale acquisition cost \nhas increased by $3,000 or more in any 12-month period or during the course \nof a treatment; (2) New biosimilar prescription drugs that have a wholesale \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 3, 2019 \nPage 21 \n \nacquisition cost that is not at least 15 percent lower than the brand name \nprescription drug to which it is biosimilar; (3) Generic prescription drugs for \nwhich the wholesale acquisition cost is either $100 or more for a 30-day supply \nor less for one unit of the drug or has increased by 200 percent or more during \nthe  preceding  calendar  year;  (4)  Any  other  prescription  drug  the  Board \ndetermines,  in  consultation  with  the  Council,  that  the  price  of  the  drug  is \ncreating significant challenges for insurers and patients in Nevada.  \n \nFor  each  drug  the  Board  identifies,  it  must  coordinate  with  the  Council  to \ndetermine whether to conduct a review of the price of the drug. The intent is \nthe  Council  has  industry  representation  that  will  balance  the  nonindustry \nrepresentation within the Board to ensure the drugs under review meet this \ncriteria and have buy-in from both sides.  \n \nSection 19 creates criteria the Board must consider when conducting such a \nreview. This includes such information as: wholesale acquisition cost of the \ndrug, the discount or rebates provided to health carriers and PBMs, the prices at \nwhich alternatives are sold in the State, cost to health carriers to provide the \nprescription drug, impact of price of the prescription drug in regard to access for \nthe drug, and other relevant criteria. \n \nAfter looking at that outlining criteria, if the Board cannot make a determination, \nsubsection 3 outlines additional criteria it may consider.  \n \nSection 20 authorizes the Board to use certain information concerning the price \nof a prescription drug when conducting a review, and take certain measures. \nThe  Board  may  enter  into  a  memorandum  of  understanding  to  acquire  this \ninformation. Subsection 3 clarifies any proprietary information disclosed to the \nBoard is confidential and not a public record.  \n \nSections 13, 27 and 28 also provide for the confidentiality of the proprietary \ninformation the Board must consider.  \n \nSection 24 requires the DHHS to provide the Board any information pursuant to \nNRS 439B.600 through 439B.695, which requires manufacturers, PBMs and \npharmaceutical representatives to submit certain information related to certain \nprescription drugs.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 3, 2019 \nPage 22 \n \nSection 21 states if, after conducting a review, the Board determines the drug \nprice is creating significant challenges for insurers and patients in Nevada, the \nBoard must prescribe a recommended upper payment limit for all purchases and \npayments of the prescription drug in the State. The first proposed amendment \nExhibit R adds the language regarding payments. Purchases are made by those \nwho take ownership of the drug, such as the wholesaler, hospital, pharmacy or \npatients. The payers, such as PBMs and insurers, also have to be included. The \ngoal  is  to  ensure  the  upper  payment  limit  applies  to  the  entire  supply  and \nfinancing chain.  \n \nIn recommending such a limit, the Board must consider relevant information, \nincluding the cost of administering the drug, delivering the drug to consumers, \nand any other relevant administrative costs of the drug.  \n \nSections 29, 30 and 32 through 36 make any upper payment limits prescribed \nby the Board mandatory after January 1, 2024. \n \nSection 39 requires the Board to conduct an additional review of the price of a \nprescription drug for which a recommended upper payment limit was prescribed \non or before December 31, 2023, and if appropriate, to prescribe a mandatory \nupper payment limit for that drug at the time.  \n \nSection 22 outlines the grievance procedure. In the event an entity feels the \nBoard has made a wrong decision, this allows for a written appeal.  \n \nSection 23 allows for the Board to adopt regulations, enter into contracts and \nsubmit  an  annual  report  to  the  Legislature.  The  annual  report  must  include \ntrends in the prescription drugs, the number of prescription drugs reviewed, \nappeals submitted for judicial review and any recommendations to increase the \naffordability of prescription drugs in the State.  \n \nThere  is  a  conceptual  amendment  (Exhibit  S)  to  expand  what  is  already  in \nsection 31. Sections 31 and 32 establish the Silver State Scripts Program. The \nSilver  State  Scripts  Program  will  allow  DHHS  to  develop  a  list  of  preferred \nprescription drugs which must be used for Medicaid and the Children's Health \nInsurance Program (CHIP).  \n \nThis preferred prescription drug list may be used for health benefit plans funded \nby a State agency, local governmental entity or nonprofit health benefit plan \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 3, 2019 \nPage 23 \n \nthat provides coverage for prescription drugs. If they choose to use the list of \npreferred prescription drugs. It requires that the DHHS to negotiate and enter \ninto  purchasing  agreements  for  the  drugs  included  in  the  list  of  preferred \nprescription drugs. It clarifies that DHHS has regulatory authority to develop the \nterms of the agreements and receive all rebates.  \n \nThe conceptual amendment Exhibit S requires DHHS to manage and govern the \npharmacy benefits for Medicaid and CHIP, as long as they are covered by a \nmanaged  care  organization  (MCO)  rather  than  have  the  MCO  manage  and \ngovern the pharmacy benefits. This means DHHS is responsible for managing \npayments  for  prescription  drugs  and  dispensing  fees,  administering  all  other \nprescription related services and costs, pharmacy benefits, data systems and \ndrug rebates. The DHHS may select and contract with a PBM as long as the \ncontract has significant transparency. It would also allow for the management \nof receiving rebates and taking appropriate action to carry out the Silver State \nScripts Program.  \n \nThe conceptual amendment Exhibit S requires the DHHS to report annually to \nthe Legislature the amount of money saved through the Silver State Scripts \nProgram. \n \nThe  last  part  of  the  conceptual  amendment  Exhibit  S  replaces  the  existing \nMedicaid Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee within DHHS with the Silver \nState Scripts Board. The Board will be required to identify prescription drugs for \ninclusion in the list of preferred prescription drugs. \n \nThe  last  part  proposes  authorizing  the  Board  to  consider  the  cost  of  a \nprescription  drug  if  there  is  no  significant  difference  in  its  clinical  efficacy, \nsafety and patient outcomes of two or more drugs. It would also allow for the \nBoard  to  close  any  portion  of  the  meeting  in  order  to  consider  proprietary \ninformation confidential.  \n \nFinally,  page  2  of  Exhibit  R  adds  audit  controls  of  a  PBM  for  transparency \npurposes.  It  requires  a  contractor  to  maintain  certain  records  and \ndocumentation, cooperate with audits and submit to an annual audit.  \n \nThe Silver State Scripts Program aims to expand the State purchasing power \nand  reduce  the  cost  for  Medicaid  and  potentially  for  other  State  and  local \ngovernment health benefit plans.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 3, 2019 \nPage 24 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI would like to summarize to make sure I understand S.B. 378. There are two \nparts to S.B. 378. The first is the Prescription Drug Affordability Board and all of \nthe necessary language to create and fund the Board. The Board manages drug \nprices in Nevada. The second part establishes the Silver State Scripts Program \nwhich  gives  the  State  the  ability  to  create  a  group  purchasing  program  for \npharmaceuticals, which could include State agencies and local governments. \nThere is also a reporting and audit process.  \n \nSENATOR CANELLA: \nYes. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDoes anyone want to testify in support of S.B. 378? \n \nMS. CAPURRO: \nThe Health Services Coalition is in support of S.B. 378. \n \nAMANDA KHAN (Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada): \nI  have  asthma  and  I  cannot  afford  the  expensive  prescription  drugs  for  my \nasthma. I have submitted written testimony (Exhibit T). I support S.B. 378.  \n \nMS. BOND: \nOn  behalf  of  the  Culinary  Health  Fund,  I  want  to  support  the  idea  of  an \naffordability board, because Nevada has not had a central location to work on \nthese issues.  \n \nMR. SULLIVAN: \nThe Culinary Union supports S.B. 378. I also want to point out the large groups \nof people wearing red shirts in this room and in Las Vegas are in support of \nS.B. 378. \n \nMR. MCALLISTER: \nThe Nevada State AFL-CIO supports S.B. 378. \n \nMR. INGALSBEE: \nThe Professional Firefighters of Nevada supports S.B. 378. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 3, 2019 \nPage 25 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWould anyone like to testify in opposition to S.B. 378? \n \nMR. FINSETH: \nI am here on behalf of PhRMA. We are in opposition to S.B. 378. \n \nADAM HOSMER-HENNER (PhRMA): \nSenate Bill 378 proposes an imposition of price control that has potential legal \nvulnerabilities. These are the same legal vulnerabilities as S.B. No. 265 of the \n79th Session. That piece of legislation was ultimately vetoed amid concerns \nabout legal challenges to its imposition of price control.  \n \nFirst,  S.B.  378  appears  to  violate  the  dormant  Commerce  Clause  of \nThe Constitution of the United States by regulating or controlling commerce in \nother states. The imposition of an upper payment limit affects transactions that \noccur entirely outside of Nevada. The amendment proposed by Senator Cancela \nappears to extend and exacerbate that problem by extending the reach of this \npiece of legislation throughout the entire supply chain.  \n \nThis piece of legislation is based on a Maryland statute. The original statute in \nMaryland was struck down by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals as violating \nthe dormant Commerce Clause after a lengthy and expensive legal battle which \nwent to the Supreme Court of the United States. The Supreme Court of the \nUnited States declined to issue certiorari to consider and potentially reverse the \ndecision of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, leaving the bill abrogated and \nvoided in Maryland.  \n \nThe  new  legislation  in  Maryland  is  significantly  different  than  the  piece  of \nlegislation presented here in S.B. 378. For one thing, it only affects purchases \nby state entities rather than by any private health insurance plan or PBM. We \nbelieve that is an attempt to limit the potential constitutional issues with respect \nto transactions that occur outside the state.  \n \nSecond, there is a preemption issue to this piece of legislation in the sense it \naffects the balance struck by the United States Congress with respect to federal \npatent law. The United States Congress has struck that balance with respect to \nthe profits for an innovator to drive innovation by pharmaceutical companies \nand by other patent holders. A price control would restrict the goal of federal \npatent law. At least one federal circuit court has determined that this attempt to \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 3, 2019 \nPage 26 \n \nset prices that can be charged by a patent holder violates that balance struck by \nthe United States Congress, which is the ability for a patent holder to set prices \n(Exhibit U).  \n \nThese are only two of the legal aspects raised.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDoes PhRMA want to add any additional remarks? \n \nMR. FINSETH: \nWe have posted a written statement by PhRMA, Exhibit U.  \n \nELISA CAFFERATA (Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada; Biotechnology Innovation \nOrganization): \nI am wearing my Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada hat. I want to address the \nSilver State Scripts portion of S.B. 378. I am still trying to get some feedback in \nterms  of  consolidation  of  prescription  medication  into  one  formulary  and \nallowing for the consideration of the costs when it comes to the medications \nthat are on the list. It might have an impact on the other work we have been \ndoing this Session. For example, expanding the availability of medications such \nas long-acting reversible contraception, which can be expensive. We have not \nhad a chance to finish that analysis and I want to bring up this issue.  \n \nMy  other  hat  is  Biotechnology  Innovation  Organization.  We  have  submitted \ntestimony in opposition to S.B. 262 (Exhibit V) and S.B. 378 (Exhibit W).  \n \nSENATOR CANCELA: \nThe Attorney General in Maryland has done a lot of work, not only on the \ndormant  Commerce  Clause,  but  also  preemption  questions.  They  have  been \nhelpful sharing that information with Nevada.  \n \nWe have crisis level problems when people cannot afford the medicine they \nneed, and that requires bold policymaking and bold action.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 3, 2019 \nPage 27 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSeeing no further business, we are adjourned at 6:10 p.m. \n \n \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nMichelle Hamilton, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 3, 2019 \nPage 28 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nExhibit / \nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \n# of pages \n  A  2    Agenda \n  B  10    Attendance Roster \nS.B. 291  C  2  Katie Anderson  Testimony \nU.S. Department of Health \nTrudy Larson / University of \nS.B. 291  D  1  and Human Services Briefing \nNevada, Reno \nReport \nTrudy Larson / University of \nS.B. 291  E  2  RUSP Core Conditions Chart \nNevada, Reno \nTrudy Larson / University of \nS.B. 291  F  1  Chart of Conditions \nNevada, Reno \nS.B. 203  G  3  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 258  H  43  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 284  I  5  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 364  J  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 456  K  1   Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nPraveen Jayakumar / \nS.B. 262  L  2   Testimony \nCulinary Health Fund \nJoseph Douglas / Culinary \nS.B. 262  M  1  Testimony \nHealth Fund \nCrystal Munoz / Culinary \nS.B. 262  N  1  Union  Testimony \n \nByron Chacon / Culinary \nS.B. 262  O  1  Testimony \nUnion \nAsher Lisec / PhRMA \nS.B. 262  P  2  Testimony \n \nSuzzanne  Bierman  / \nS.B. 262   Q  1  Department  of  Health  and Testimony \nHuman Services \nS.B. 378  R   1  Senator Yvanna D.

I have \nput together a short slide presentation (Exhibit D). The mobile trailer design will \nallow people to process poultry through the use of these trailers. There are \nsome  pictures  of  the  mobile  chicken  processing  trailer  on  the  first  slide, \nExhibit D. Page 2 outlines the need to change existing laws. We currently have \nno  legal  poultry  processing  plants  in  northern  Nevada.  According  to  the \nU.S. Food  Safety  and  Inspection  Service  website,  we  have  two  processing \nplants,  one  in  Las  Vegas,  Newport  Meat  of  Nevada  and  the  other  is  the \nUniversity of Nevada, Reno, Wolf Pack Meats. I contacted Wolf Pack Meats \ntoday and was told they do not process poultry at this time.  \n \nThe benefits to passing S.B. 390 are on page 3. It would allow people with a \n1,000  chickens  or  less  to  process  these  birds.  It  would  give  community \nservants such as 4-H, Future Farmers of America and some of our small farmers \nthe  ability  to  start  processing  chickens.  This  would  allow  these  people  to \nharvest  and  package  them  under  regulated  health  conditions.  We  want  the \nNevada  Department  of  Agriculture  (NDA)  to  process  this  information. \nSenate Bill 390, would allow for the use of mobile poultry processing, page 4, \nonce it is inspected by the NDA.  \n \nPoultry processing has a health certification process. We are transferring this \nfunction to the NDA. The advantage of being mobile allows the processing unit \nto move to each area. We envision the mobile poultry processing trailer would \ngo to small places, groups and communities, where people would need 400 or \n500 birds processed. This would give them the ability to have them legally \nprocessed in a clean certified facility and then they would be able to sell their \nprocessed birds.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 4 \n \nOn page 5 of Exhibit D, training would be offered through Western Nevada \nCollege. Once trained, you would be required to pass a certification test through \nNDA and have to meet the known State requirement standards for processing \npoultry. You must pass the written test and become certified to either rent the \nmobile processing trailer or have someone with that trailer and the certification \nto process your poultry. Once you have your chickens processed, and met all \nthe requirements, you would be able to sell those chickens or processed birds.  \n \nOn page 7 of Exhibit D, you will find a Reno Gazette-Journal article written by \nMark Robison. It talks about how important this economic development would \nbe  for  our  area,  especially  since  there  is  no  big  growth  in  the  local  food \neconomy. We do not have any local processors to allow us to market local \nchickens.  \n \nThe cost of passing the bill is outlined on page 8 of Exhibit D. Currently, there is \nnot impact to the State. All the resources and expenses would be paid for by \nthe consumer. If you needed certification, you would have to pay for by the \nclasses and the testing. This is the same as the cottage industry bills. Once \ncertified, you would pay to rent the trailer and process your chickens.  \n \nIn conclusion, on page 9 of Exhibit D, passing S.B. 390 would mean an increase \nof economic growth for small farmers. This would also increase the ability of \nthe consumer to have farm fresh poultry from a local farmer and give small \ncommunity groups the opportunity to increase funds by the sale of poultry in \nour area.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nMy understanding is this project has been in the regulatory process for about \nfive years. As it started moving through the regulatory process, at some point, it \nsort of hit a brick wall, because there was not a Nevada Revised Statute (NRS) \nto authorize this type of facility. I believe S.B. 390 and its amendment creates \nthe concept. Who is the State Quarantine Officer? \n \nSENATOR HANSEN: \nIt is one of the job duties of the Director of the NDA. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nBasically, this bill creates the category for the NDA to create the regulations \nthat would assure the public that this processing would be safe. The regulations \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 5 \n \nare not in the bill because they would occur if the bill were passed, and this \nprocess were allowed to move forward. Is that the understanding? \n \nSENATOR HANSEN: \nAbsolutely,  that  is  my  understanding.  It  was  discovered  in  the  regulatory \nprocess,  the  NDA  did  not  have  the  authority  to  move  this  forward  in  the \nabsence of a change in NRS. Senate Bill 390 will create the change in NRS to \nallow the NDA to regulate this type of mobile unit.  \n \nMR. ROBISON: \nYes, that is the intent of S.B. 390. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs anyone here in support of S.B. 390? \n \nANN  LOUHELA  (Director,  Specialty  Crop  Institute,  Western  Nevada  College; \nPresident, Nevada Grown): \nI have triple responsibilities today. The first one is as the Director of Western \nNevada College, Specialty Crop Institute. It is a small farm agriculture program \nthat has served the community for the past ten years. It provides training for \nsmall  farms  and  economic  development.  The  Institute  would  provide  the \nworkshops and training needed to pass any required testing. We have been \ndoing this for ten years and collaborate a lot with NDA and the University of \nNevada Cooperative Extension. Our highest priority is food safety and good \nagricultural practices.  \n \nI am also the President of Nevada Grown. Nevada Grown is a nonprofit that \npromotes agriculture and provides community education. This bill would open \neconomic  development  for  small  farms  and  restaurants.  The  demand  from \nrestaurants exceeds what farmers are able to provide. There is a huge poultry \ndemand by restaurants. \n \nMy last responsibility is as a consumer. For the past ten years, I have bought \nmy meat from farms. I feel much safer with the food I get from a small farmer \nrather than at a grocery store. As a consumer, I would like the option to buy \nsmall farm poultry at a grocery store.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 6 \n \nMICHAEL DELEE (Delee Law Offices, LLC): \nI  have  a  family  farm  located  in  Nye  County  which  has  over  2,000  organic \npasture chickens. We look forward to being part of this program and are in \nsupport of S.B. 390. \n \nNANCY OGAN (Ogan Family Farm): \nI have a small family farm in Wellington, Nevada. I am testifying in support of \nS.B. 390. We raise a few hundred birds for processing on a small level. We are \nunder the 1,000 bird limit. We invite people out to our farm to learn the process \nof how to humanely and safely harvest their birds. I would like to be able to \nharvest  some  of  our  chickens  for  people  who  are  not  interested  in  the \nharvesting process, but still want to buy birds from us. I would like to use a \nfacility like this and take my product to a farmer's market, along with eggs and \nproduce.  \n \nWe are looking to expand and buy a bigger farm with some hay and some \npasture and this would give us an opportunity to get some economic income to \ndo such a thing. This could also allow us to start a Community Supported \nAgriculture (CSA) program. The CSA programs allow people to sign up and get \nbaskets of produce, honey, eggs and poultry.  \n \nJOE CHAMBERS (Rusty Skillet Ranch and Quail Farm):  \nWe are a first generation, small family farm in support of S.B. 390. We raise \ndomestic quail. Currently, we are selling quail eggs but have a demand for meat \nproducts. We are unable to fulfill the demand for the meat products. There \nwould be a positive economic impact for the ranch if this bill were to pass.  \n \nJUANITA COX: \nI have a number of chickens and eggs. I think this would be a good opportunity \nfor young people, especially in the rural areas.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs there anyone in opposition to S.B. 390? \n \nSUE KENNEDY: \nI am the owner of Kennedy Ranch in Elko County that sells grass finished beef, \npasture raised poultry and fresh eggs. I am reluctant to testify in opposition to \nS.B. 390; however, it is missing some critical elements for food safety. I hope \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 7 \n \nto  be  able  to  help  you  draft  a  better  bill.  I  have  written  testimony  and  an \namendment (Exhibit E) that will address all the issues in my testimony.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI see some of what you are addressing would be handled in the regulatory \nprocess. Some issues deal with whether this process should be handled by the \nNDA or the Division of Public and Behavioral Health, Department of Health and \nHuman Services (DHHS). I would like to invite you to meet with Senator Hansen \nover these issues. I can see Senator Hansen is in agreement.  \n \nMS. KENNEDY: \nI would be happy to do that.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs there anyone who would like to testify neutral on S.B. 390?  \n \nDOUG  FARRIS  (Administrator,  Animal  Industry  Division,  Department  of \nAgriculture): \nThe NDA is neutral on S.B. 390. We have reviewed the amended language and \nhave heard from many producers who are in favor of S.B. 390. We look forward \nto working with them.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWould you be able to meet with Senator Hansen and Ms. Kennedy? \n \nMR. FARRIS: \nI would be happy to do that. \n \nSENATOR HANSEN: \nThis is a broad bill to allow NDA to develop the regulations that Ms. Kennedy \nwas concerned about. We will be happy to meet with Ms. Kennedy and NDA to \nsee if there is any specific language needed to be included in NRS.  \n \nIf anyone is curious about how many chickens are processed in the United \nStates in any given year, that number is 9 billion plus chickens. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe Committee will be interested in knowing the pros and cons of having this \nunder the NDA versus the DHHS. I will close the hearing on S.B. 390. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 8 \n \nVICE CHAIR WOODHOUSE: \nI will open the hearing on S.B. 293. \n \nSENATE BILL 293: Makes various changes relating to children who are victims \nof commercial sexual exploitation. (BDR 38-517) \n \nSENATOR JULIA RATTI (Senatorial District No. 13): \nFor years now, Nevada has known there are child victims of sex trafficking in \nour State. While the extent of the problem is difficult to identify with specificity, \nNevada consistently ranks as one of the states with the greatest minor sex \ntrafficking problems and populations.  \n \nI want to acknowledge Nevada has made great strides recently to create a plan \nfor  the  scope  and  breadth  of  the  problem  through  the  Nevada  Coalition  to \nPrevent the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children (CSEC) established by \nExecutive  Order  in  2016.  The  CSEC  Coalition  has  started  to  address  many \ndifficult questions. I intend for S.B. 293 to work in conjunction with the work \nalready being done by the CSEC Coalition.  \n \nEighteen states and the District of Columbia have enacted \"safe harbor\" laws, \nrecognizing that children cannot legally consent to sexual acts with adults and \nare often manipulated into prostitution through fear, emotional deceit, force or \nintimidation.  While  a  range  of  responses  are  needed  to  address  the  unique \nsituation of each trafficked child, the traditional model has relied heavily on \narrest and detention of the most vulnerable person in the triad of child, pimp \nand customer. National trends and best practices are moving away from this \nmodel and recognizing the universal truth; victims should not be punished for \ntheir victimization.  \n \nSenate Bill 293 embraces that truth and collectively forces us to confront the \nvery real placement needs of these victims. For too long, we have allowed our \nvictimized children to be detained in juvenile detention because no one has ever \nbeen  able  to  answer  the  question,  \"If  not  here,  where  will  we  put  these \nchildren?\" Using a punishment based model sends these children the wrong \nmessage. To them, it feels like punishment.  \n \nThe original draft of this bill was aggressive. It laid out a requirement to create \ntreatment  and  home-based  placement  options  for  these  victims  in  the  child \nwelfare  system,  while  eliminating  the  ability  to  utilize  the  juvenile  detention \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 9 \n \nmodel for this population. Understandably, there was a lot of duress when this \nversion of the bill came out.  \n \nThere are a lot of good people who are trying to figure this out. We know we do \nnot want to handle this as a crime. We know we do not want to criminalize \nchildren who are victims. Sometimes it appears putting them in the juvenile \njustice system is the only safe place to take care of them. We cannot flip a \nswitch and have all the resources we need to treat these children as victims in \nthe child welfare system. We are laying out a process that we think will get us \nthere. I want to be clear: \n \nWe are putting a stake in the ground. How we are doing things \ntoday is not appropriate, and we need to get to a place where we \nknow what the system is that we need to build, and have invested \nand started building that system to make sure these children are \ntreated as victims and not as criminals.  \n \nI believe there is a careful path to ensure that we as a State can be successful \nin  the  implementation  of  that  vision.  Therefore,  we  are  working  off  of  a \nconceptual amendment (Exhibit F) and pretty much the entire bill is gone.  \n \nThe amendment requires the development of a research and treatment-based \nplan throughout the next biennium to articulate exactly what is needed to fix \nthe gaps in services that will lead us away from a detention-based model for \nvictimized children. We have a responsibility and an opportunity to lead in this \narea; I believe the plan is the key.  \n \nFirst, Nevada will add a position within the Division of Child and Family Services \n(DCFS) with DHHS overseeing CSEC services, including implementation of the \ncomponents  of  this  bill.  This  person  will  provide  a  key  role  in  stakeholder \ncoordination and proactive planning—filling the gap that currently exists.  \n \nThe  second  step  will  be  for  this  new  position  to  create  a  plan  for \ntreatment-based infrastructure to serve the CSEC population. This will require \nanswers to a lot of difficult questions. What are the gaps in services? How do \nwe recruit and maintain placement options? What do the different placement \noptions  look  like?  How  can  we  increase  the  likelihood  of  success  of  these \nplacements? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 10 \n \nNext, by October 2020, this plan is to be presented during the interim to the \nLegislature for it to consider investing in the needed infrastructure.  \n \nThe  ultimate  goal  will  be  removal  of  any  reliance  on  the  juvenile  detention \nsystem to treat and house our most vulnerable and victimized youth.  \n \nMARY MCCARTHY (Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada): \nI am an attorney at the Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada. We support \nS.B. 293 as amended. I work with children who are abused and neglected in \ntheir home. My specific focus is sexual abuse by a parent, step-parent, sibling \nor someone in a relationship with a parent, who is regularly found in the home \nand therefore has access to the child.  \n \nSexual abuse is perpetrated in secret by people on whom the child depends and \nwhom the child trusts. The manipulation, sometimes called \"grooming\" of the \ntargeted child happens slowly. Unlike other types of child abuse, perpetrators \nwork very hard to form an emotional bond with a child and preserve secrecy. \nThey may buy items a child wants, take them on trips around town without the \nother family members, confide in them as though they are a peer and tell them \noften how special they are. Alternatively, some abusers insist on exercising \nsuch control over family members that a child dares not challenge his authority.  \n \nWhen personal boundaries are crossed, children are confused and accept the \nabusers version of the truth such as, it is just for fun, it is natural, it is for their \nown good, it is so you will know what to do or it is because you and I are so \nclose and I want you to feel good. Abusers use whatever fiction is necessary to \nmaintain the emotional bond and trust of the victim. Often an abuser will tell a \nchild that if they tell anyone, they will both be in trouble or a family member will \nbe hurt emotionally or even physically. Some children have had their boundaries \nviolated so profoundly that they no longer recognize their right to their own likes \nand dislikes, their own friends and outside relationships, their own bodies, or \ntheir right to say no. This is the sexual abuse that precedes sexual exploitation \nby a pimp and can later lead to years of sexual exploitation as a trafficked adult.  \n \nThe majority of adults engaged in prostitution were once child victims of sex \ntrafficking. These adults are desperate for affection and attention, and a man \nwho says you are my girlfriend, who buys them clothing, pays for salon visits, \nmakes them wanted, is pedaling a powerful drug.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 11 \n \nEventually, the victim will be forced to understand that her boyfriend needs her \nto sell her body to support them both. One of my clients expressed this moment \nand her reaction was, \"Well I was doing the same thing for free, and I might as \nwell get paid for it.\" When the pimp tells her they will both be arrested and she \nwill be detained if she tells, his credibility is enhanced in her mind, when that is \nwhat happens.  \n \nSometimes older children see prostitution as a way to survive street life. They \nwould rather think of themselves as survivors than as victims or offenders. \nHowever, even in instances when a child apparently sells her body without a \npimp, federal law considers any child engaging in a commercial exchange for \nsex to be a traffic child. The customer can be defined as, \"one who causes a \nperson  under  18  to  engage  in  a  commercial  sex  act,\"  in  the  Victims  of \nTrafficking and Violence Projection Act of 2000. I would also like to refer the \nCommittee to the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act \npassed by the U.S. Congress in 2014.  \n \nIt can take years for an adult to realize the context of the limited choices she \nhad available to her. I say her, because according to a 2011 report, Commercial \nSexual Exploitation of Child Sex Trafficking, by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, \n95 percent of CSEC children are females. If we agree children are victimized by \npimps, gangs, pedophiles, and \"johns\" seeking sex from a child, why is it that \nwe continue to have only the blunt instrument of detention to address the needs \nof  the  affected  child?  This  is  like  the  old  saying,  \"When  all  you  have  is  a \nhammer, everything looks like a nail.\" We need more tools to get more children \nout of the sex trade and provide them with a path to a high school diploma, a \njob, a way to be in a healthy relationship, have healthy children, and a better \nfuture than past.  \n \nSenate  Bill  293,  and  its  amendment,  envisions  new  tools  to  respond  to \ntraumatized and sexually exploited children. An intake resource is where the \nwelcome is warm, the clothes are not detention sweats, the peers have been in \nthe same situation, health screenings, counseling and resources are available in \na setting where judgement is withheld. Foster homes are where trained adults \nprovide a new script for interaction with respect and appropriate boundaries in \neducational attainment. These resources must be attractive and empowering \nenough  for  the  child  and  compete  with  the  lure  of  the  street  and  the \nboyfriend/pimp who is circling like a shark.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 12 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nDid the fiscal note go away? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nIt  is  such  a  different  bill;  the  original  fiscal  note  is  no  longer  valid.  In  the \nconceptual amendment, we are asking for one full-time position to be in DCFS. \nWe should get an updated fiscal note to reflect that.  \n \nBAILEY BORTOLIN (Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada): \nWe have been working with all the child welfare agencies; they are present at \nthe meeting to answer any questions in regard to the fiscal note or the bill.  \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nThis issue is important. Is there a \"Plan B\" if the fiscal note preempts this bill? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nI feel strongly that we need to \"Put this stake in the ground.\" If we do not do \nthis  we  will  continue  to  work  within  the  same  system.  I  will  advocate  as \nstrongly as I can and hope other members of the Committee will do this as well. \nIf we get to the end of the Session and we cannot get there, we need to find \nanother  way  to  fund  this.  Whether  it  be  a  grant,  a  philanthropic  donation, \nsomeone or something to help us get started in this process. I do think it is \nimportant for there to be one person whose job responsibility is to make sure \nthat  this  happens.  I  do  not  want  to  be  coy  about  this  process.  The  next \npresentation at the next Legislative Session will have a significant fiscal note. \nWe came across a sincere concern by local governments that this could be an \nunfunded mandate. They thought the State would mandate this and not give \nthem the resources to do it. I am not  going to  give up on this before the \n120th day of the Session.  \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nPerhaps someone who will be testifying later could answer the question of how \nmuch that position would cost.  \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nI am sure that is possible. I did want to go to step four of the amendment where \nit says, \"Set an implementation deadline for the state to safely and successfully \nremove any reliance on juvenile detention to house child victims of commercial \nsexual exploitation.\" Since the submission of this amendment, we have had \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 13 \n \nconversations  with  legal  counsel,  and  we  must  set  a  date.  That  date  is \nJuly 1, 2022.  This  leaves  another  Legislative  Session  to  talk  about  the \nnecessary resources to flip that switch in a way that is safe and responsible for \nthe children we are serving.  \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nIf the question is the fiscal note, how can we put a price on the children who \nhave been sexually exploited? I do not think we can put a price on that. What if \nit were one of our children? These are children in situations in which they had \nno  control  over.  We  as  legislators  should  shoulder  the  burden  of  returning \nbalance to the life of a child who has been sexually exploited.  \n \nVICE CHAIR WOODHOUSE: \nOften times, we need to take a step back. We should question, how much does \nit cost, as opposed to what is the long range issue? We have to look at who is \nbeing helped with this.  \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nWe have services now that support some of this population. By saying this \nissue does not belong in the juvenile justice system is not in any way a critique \nof  our  juvenile  justice  agency.  They  have  been  creative  about  how  to  get \nservices  to  the  population.  There  are  investments  being  made  now  in  the \njuvenile justice system as well as in the child welfare system. This will not all be \nnew dollars; part of it will be looking at how current dollars are allocated. Then \nwe can create a transition plan to reallocate those resources. There may be \nsome  new  funding  needed  as  well.  We  need  a  planning  time  frame  to \nthoughtfully decide what we are currently doing, as well as the new framework \nand resources we need. Perhaps specialized licensed care foster homes or other \nmodels may be created during the interim. We have existing resources and need \nto look at how we allocate them, perhaps differently, to get this accomplished.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nCould we not consider foster homes now? \n \nMS. BORTOLIN:  \nWe do use some foster homes; however, both juvenile justice and welfare want \nto provide better wrap-around services. This would allow greater success in \nthose placements. Currently, there is no specialized treatment, services or plans \nspecific  to  the  needs  of  this  population.  We  know  this  population  needs \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 14 \n \ntrauma-based treatment and informed care. We also know those parents in the \nfoster homes need to be adequately prepared to care for this population. We \nneed to provide specialized training. Currently, we do not have the specialized \ncare, and the foster home placements are not successful.  \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThere is a placement part for children who are appropriate for foster care. There \nis also a short-term transitional part dealing with the time a victim is located on \nthe street typically by law enforcement until the period of time when they are \nplaced in a home or even reunited with parents who are capable of taking their \nchild  and  recovering  with  the  correct  wrap-around  services.  There  is  a \nshort-term part where there is a need to balance protection and appropriate \nplacement. Currently, that model does not exist—nor how will it work. There \nare not many foster homes set up to prevent a child from running away and \ngoing back to the danger she was just removed from. Not every child needs \nlong-term foster placement, but every child needs a short-term intervention, and \nthat model still needs to be built. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI think we are waiting for the perfect system at the expense of children today. \nRealistically,  we  have  kids  that  run  away.  We  have  children  who  have \nchallenges. If we are waiting for the perfect wrap-around service, we are not \nmaking a difference for the children today. I do not see the point of waiting to \nbe perfect.  \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nI agree with you 100 percent. This is why I wrote the original bill. We are not \ngoing to help these children in juvenile justice; we are going to help them with \nchild welfare and wrap-around services. The victim of sexual exploitation is not \nthe typical run-away. They frequently run right back to their pimp and a very \ndangerous  situation.  I  do  not  think  we  are  waiting  for  perfect,  but  we  are \nresponsible by waiting to make sure we have the right protections in place.  \n \nI tried to picture myself being a parent who perhaps lives in California or Utah, \nwho has received a call telling them, \"We have found your daughter, come and \nget her.\" Then in the interim of taking her out of the juvenile justice system and \nputting her someplace else, she runs away. By the time I as her parent get to \nLas Vegas or wherever she was being held, she is no longer there. We need to \nsolve this issue before we get away from holding them in the juvenile justice \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 15 \n \nsystem. We need to be responsible about building that transitional piece. It is \nnot something that exists today, especially if we are no longer going to use the \njuvenile justice system.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nDo we have any study that shows what you are envisioning works? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nI think we need to build the system. I believe Nevada is the right one to do this \nbecause its numbers are so atrocious. If anyone can do this, Nevada can. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nLet us not wait.  \n \nVICE CHAIR WOODHOUSE: \nIs anyone here in support of S.B. 293? \n \nAMBER HOWELL (Director, Human Services Agency, Washoe County): \nI want to thank the sponsor for allowing Washoe County to have some time to \ndigest this difficult situation. Washoe County has between 20 and 30 children in \nthe foster care system that are CSEC. We do not know the number of children \nwho  do  not  end  up  in  our  system.  We  want  to  offer  support  with  the \namendment. We are in a position where we cannot get it wrong and there are \nnot any states that are doing it right. Washoe County has a deep and restrictive \nplacement option which is juvenile detention; we have a free and open situation \nin our Kids Kottage Shelter, which is not very safe, and we have nothing in-\nbetween. What I like most about the amendment is this is not a child welfare \nissue, it is not a juvenile justice issue and it is not a mental health issue, it is all \nof our issues, and we all need to put our minds together to get it right. Tagging \nthis issue with one agency is where states are failing because this is a very \nserious and difficult population who are coming our way. We want to do good \nby them.  \n \nHOLLY WELBORN (American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada):  \nWe want  to register our support for this important piece  of legislation. We \nbelieve the appropriate place for CSEC should be in the child welfare system. \nWe are pleased there is an effective date for removing CSEC from the juvenile \njustice system.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 16 \n \nJARED BUSKER (Children's Advocacy Alliance): \nWe are in support of S.B. 293. \n \nJOHN PIRO (Clark County): \nIt is time for Nevada to get off the list of bad categories. The Clark County \nPublic Defender's Office supports S.B. 293. \n \nKENDRA BERTSCHY (Washoe County Public Defender's Office): \nWhat we have been discussing during this Legislative Session is how do we \nprotect  the  victims?  This  is  who  these  children  are.  When  we  send  these \nchildren to a detention center, we are revictimizing them. What are we telling \nour youth when we detain them? That they are not good enough to be in foster \nhomes, and we have no solution for them? It is time for a solution.  \n \nKIMBERLY MULL (Kimberly Mull Advocacy and Consulting): \nI hold a master's degree in victim services management, and I am an expert in \nsexual violence and victim's rights. I was identified by Shared Hope International \nas  one  of  the  Country's  leading  policy  experts  on  child  sex  trafficking  and \nprostitution.  I  am  a  survivor  of  child  pornography  and  child  sex  trafficking \nmyself.  Passing  \"safe  harbor\"  laws  is  the  number  one  initiative  for  sex \ntrafficking advocates and programs across the Country. Minnesota and Florida \nhave similar foster care programs that have been in place for a while.  \n \nI was going to focus my testimony on the fact that I was 11 years old the first \ntime I was paid to get on my knees in front of a man or the fact that I was \n12 years old the first time I thought I was pregnant. When I thought I was \npregnant, I curled up on the floor and repeatedly punched myself in the stomach \ntrying  to  make  a  baby,  that  did  not  exist,  come  out.  I  was  13  when  my \ntrafficker stopped using threats against my parents, my brother and my pets to \ncontrol  me,  but  rather,  my  trafficker  informed  me  that  I  was  a  criminal,  a \nprostitute and if anyone found out, I would be removed from my family and \nthrown into prison. My only crime was being raped by men who chose to pay to \nrape me, rather than rape their own children. In the eyes of the law that made \nthem  less  liable  and  they  would  be  given  no  jail  time,  but  I  would  receive \njuvenile detention.  \n \nUpon further review of the bill, I saw the fiscal note attached to the original bill, \nincluding Clark County's $14 million per year fiscal note, as well as an unfunded \nmandate note attached to the bill. I started to laugh and realized that everyone's \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 17 \n \nreason for locking children up in this State and labeling them as criminals is \nbecause they believe there are no other resources available. No one is doing the \nmath and I am going to do the math on the record, right here, right now.  \n \nEach of these children are servicing 10 to 20 men a day, and let us assume 5 of \nthose men are tourists. Five tourists a day for 365 days a year, because there \nare no breaks for these children by their pimps, is 1,825 tourists per year per \nchild. Therefore, 1,825 tourists per year per child at an average cost of $827 \nlegitimate tourist dollars is $1,509,275 legitimate tourist dollars brought into \nLas Vegas, per child, per year. Each one of these victimized children is bringing \nin to Las Vegas, $1,509,275 legitimate tourist dollars because \"What happens \nhere stays here, come rape our Nevadan children, because the average age of \nentry into prostitution is 12 to 14 years old.\"  \n \nLet us put those numbers together; $1,509,275 times 150 raped children who \nare rescued a year equals $226,391,250 a year in legitimate tourist dollars \nbrought to Las Vegas. This figure only applies to the rescued children, it does \nnot include the unrescued children and the unrescued women who are enslaved, \ntrafficked and raped.  \n \nThis is not an unfunded mandate. This is not a situation where there is simply \nno money to help these children. This is a situation where it is simply not a \npriority. Their only crime is that they are being raped by men who chose to pay \nfor it. This is either not a priority or it is too profitable for Nevada to take action \nagainst  it.  Is  Nevada's  current  sex  trafficking  marketing  campaign  too \nsuccessful? After all, Nevada has over $225 million at stake by looking the \nother way.  \n \nELISA CAFFERATA (Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada):  \nPlanned  Parenthood  Votes  Nevada  has  come  to  the  table  the  past  several \nsessions in support for services for people who have been trafficked because \nthe number one need for these victims is health care. We believe this is the best \napproach to address this issue and provide wrap-around services. \n \nBRIGID DUFFY (Director, Juvenile Division, Clark County District Attorney): \nI oversee the Juvenile Division, which consists of both a delinquency team and \na child welfare team. I am testifying as a District Attorney because this bill will \naffect both my delinquency and child welfare teams. I want to state on behalf \nof  Clark  County,  with  the  conceptual  amendment;  our  fiscal  note  can  be \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 18 \n \nremoved.  We  work  with  these  victims  every  single  day.  As  a  member  of \nGovernor Sandoval's CSEC Coalition, we have studied models of how to house \nand treat victims of CSEC; we are finding that \"safe harbor bills\" such as those \nin New York and California are not solving the issue. They are not getting the \noutcomes they would like; they are not in the best interest of children. This is \nNevada's opportunity to bring a bunch of passionate people together who really \nwant to solve this problem in a State where it is rampant and come up with the \nbest practice model. This needs to cross all stages and agencies from mental \nhealth, to juvenile delinquency, to child welfare, to district attorneys, to legal \nadvocates and nonprofit organizations.  \n \nVICE CHAIR WOODHOUSE: \nIs anyone in opposition to S.B. 293? \n \nTOSHIA SHAW (Executive Director, The Embracing Project): \nI am the Executive Director and a victorious survivor. The Embracing Project is a \ndirect service provider. We work with the victims every day from ages 12 to \n21. I oppose the conceptual amendment, as it is written, but I look forward to \nworking with the sponsors, so I can be in support of this bill.  \n \nVICE CHAIR WOODHOUSE: \nIt is my understanding you are opposed to the conceptual amendment, is that \ncorrect? \n \nMS. SHAW: \nCorrect. \n \nSENATOR HAMMAND: \nWhat are you opposed to within the conceptual amendment? \n \nMS. SHAW: \nI would like to be invited to the table, not just The Embracing Project, but the \nother direct service providers here in Las Vegas. We have not been invited to \nthe table; we need to be able to sit down with the other stakeholders.  \n \nVICE CHAIR WOODHOUSE: \nIs anyone neutral on S.B. 293? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 19 \n \nROSS  ARMSTRONG  (Administrator,  Division  of  Child  and  Family  Services, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nThis is not simply a juvenile justice or a child welfare issue, it is an issue for all \nof our child-serving agencies. Rather than send these victims into a system that \nwas not created for them, the conceptual amendment will allow us to create a \nsystem  designed  for  their  particular  needs.  This  bill  goes  nicely  with \n(Assembly Bill 151) along with the conceptual amendment to truly develop a \nCSEC system for these particular victims.  \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 151: Provides for the protection of children who are victims of \ncommercial sexual exploitation. (BDR 38-457)  \n \nThe fiscal note is for the original bill; we have not developed a fiscal note for \nthe conceptual amendment. The duties are a little different for the position. If \nthere were an appropriation attached, that could eliminate the fiscal note. For \nexample, if the Committee were to go with a lump sum for either the hiring of a \nState employee or contractual services, or we were able to contract with an \nindividual to manage the CSEC Coalition. We will do whatever the Committee \nprefers.  \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nWould these children qualify for victims of crime compensation? \n \nMR. ARMSTRONG: \nThe victims of crime compensation is currently administered by the Department \nof Administration. I do not believe there is an age limit for that program; I do not \nsee why they would not be eligible.  \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThere is a bill to move this program to DHHS. \n \nMR. ARMSTRONG: \nI am aware of that. \n \nCHARLES PECK (Sergeant, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department): \nI am the supervisor of the Child Exploitation Task Force in Las Vegas. The Task \nForce  is  comprised  of  Las  Vegas  Metropolitan  Police  Department  (LVMPD) \ndetectives and FBI agents. We all want to work for the same goal. I want to talk \na little about my experience. For the past eight years, I have been the supervisor \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 20 \n \nof the Task Force. We respond to all tips and cases of child sex trafficking in \nsouthern Nevada. I have been involved in roughly 1,000 investigations. Over \nthat time period, about 40 percent to 50 percent of our cases are not in the \njuvenile justice system. I have heard people think that all of our cases are in the \njuvenile justice system—and they are not. The LVMPD agrees that the juvenile \njustice system is not the solution and \"safe harbor\" laws are the way to go. We \nare neutral on this bill. We only saw the original bill and were only recently \nmade aware of the amendment.  \n \nI do want to comment in regard to the 72-hour holds. The LVMPD responds at \nall hours to these recoveries. In about 40 percent to 50 percent of these cases, \nthere is a high risk to that child who is on the streets or found in a casino. There \nis confusion for the child; love is a factor. There is shame on their part. There is \nembarrassment and many different factors. There is also the risk they could run \nback to their trafficker—or whatever you want to call them.  \n \nIn those cases, LVMPD proposes a 72-hour hold for a mental health evaluation; \nservices  could  begin.  It  could  be  equivalent  to  a  Legal  2000  mental  health \nemergency  hold  or  something  similar  in  State  law.  I  am  not  sure  if  the \ndetermination would be a law enforcement officer of the State or it could be \nchild protective services. In the draft I saw, this was not specific. California \ndoes  have  language  to  place  temporary  holds  on  those  high  risk  cases  for \nchildren.  The  Legislature  should  put  that  language  in  this  bill  to  allow  law \nenforcement or child protective services to have the tools to not allow that child \nto go back to the exploiter but to begin the recovery process.  \n \nI want to leave you with one quick story. When I first came to the unit, there \nwas a meeting of about 25 stakeholders, mainly in the juvenile justice system. \nThere were two survivors brought to that meeting and questions were posed to \nthem. What could be done better and what was done poorly. One survivor was \nin her teens; the other survivor was in her early twenties, who I believe went on \nspeaking engagements at various high schools. As the questions went around \nthe room I asked them, \"What was the best thing law enforcement did for \nyou?\" Both of the survivors said at the same time, \"Put me behind a locked \ndoor.\" They did not mean arrest them; they just wanted a process to stop them \nfrom going back to their exploiter. It shocked everyone. I want to leave that \nwith the Committee. In some cases, not all, but in those difficult cases where \nwe do find them on the street or the casino, that we would allow in the law \nsome sort of emergency hold to bring in those support services.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 21 \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nI think that last neutral testifier demonstrates there are a lot of people working \non  this  issue  and  thinking  of  ways  we  could  improve  it.  There  was  great \nprogress created by the work of the CSEC Coalition during the interim. While \ncommissions, professionals and survivors have value, if we do not put a stake in \nthe ground that says we are no longer going to treat victims as offenders, we \nwill find ourselves six years from now, eight years from now, ten years from \nnow, still having this conversation and defaulting back to the juvenile justice \nsystem.  \n \nThe amendment puts in a deadline date and by that time we are going to figure \nout what we need to do to create a system to best meet the needs of these \nchildren. What are we going to do differently? If there is to be a locked door, \nhow can that locked door in the child welfare system treat that child like a \nvictim who may be in need of protection? These victims need to get a treatment \nprocess that does not treat them like a criminal in any way, shape or form, but \ntreats them as a victim and helps them along a journey to recovery through a \nwide variety of supports including those in the nonprofit system. We are not \ngoing to do another study. We are not going to create another commission; we \nare going to put a position in place. It will be their responsibility to pull everyone \ntogether  and  decide  what  we  are  going  to  do  differently  so  that  by \nJuly 1, 2022, this will no longer happen in Nevada.  \n \nVICE CHAIR WOODHOUSE: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 293. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will open the hearing on S.B. 418.  \n \nSENATE BILL 418: Revises provisions governing the distribution and sale of raw \nmilk. (BDR 51-1073) \n \nSENATOR JAMES OHRENSCHALL (Senatorial District No. 21): \nI am presenting on behalf of Senator Parks. I have had the pleasure of working \nwith him on this piece of Legislation for several months. These days many \npeople desire natural foods, fresh eggs from the farm and many other products. \nFarmers' Markets are very popular. There is a desire for people to consume \nunpasteurized milk or raw milk. Senator Parks grew up in New Hampshire and \nwas raised on a farm and raw milk. It is a product for which there is a demand. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 22 \n \nRaw milk is covered in NRS 584, but it is difficult for consumers to get raw \nmilk.  \n \nAre there dangers to raw milk? Yes, there are dangers, and there needs to be \nprotections for the consumer. This can be established through S.B. 418. There \nhave been protections established for farm fresh eggs, raw fish or any other \nproducts  like  that.  I  would  ask  the  Committee  to  focus  on  the  conceptual \namendment (Exhibit G). \n \nMR. DELEE:  \nIt was brought to our attention that there was a fiscal note attached due to the \ninitial desire to have this centralized. Back in 2013, one of this Committee's \nrecommendations was to change the various functions of the counties with \nregard to raw milk to the Dairy Commission. When we saw the fiscal note, we \nwrote the amendment, Exhibit G, to keep this at a county level, which is where \nit has been in statute since 1979.  \n \nThe first change is section 2, which recognizes the county milk commission still \nexists  and  oversees  the  production  and  distribution  of  certified  raw  milk. \nParagraph  2  creates  a  new  version  of  NRS  584.209. \nNevada Revised Statute 584.209 was added as a function of S.B. No. 80 of the \n77th Session and a companion bill with A.B. No. 209 of the 77th Session which \nwas  the  raw  milk  bill  at  the  time.  Unfortunately,  this  bill  was  vetoed  after \nreceiving 57 votes in the legislature. Now, NRS 584.209 will take on a different \nroll.  At  the  bottom  of  NRS 584.209  section  2,  subsection  2,  some  more \nspecifics are added and we have gone back to the county milk commissions.  \n \nOne  of  the  problems  counties  were  having  is  the  qualifications  needed  to \nestablish a county milk commission. For example, there is not a rural medical \ndoctor and veterinarian living in Esmeralda County. This existing language made \nit impossible for counties to comply. This is not something new. If you look at \nS.B. No.  301  of  the  76th  Session,  it  recommended  loosening  the  rules  for \nmembership  for  what  was  then  the  State  Dairy  Commission  for  the  same \nreasons; compliance was impossible. We would like the county commission to \nbe able to set the parameters for the members they appoint to the county milk \ncommissions. This should remove the fiscal note. We are not asking the NDA to \ndo  anything  more  than  it  is  already  obligated  under  statute  to  do.  In  the \nadditional green language, there is this exemption under NRS 584.209 for small \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 23 \n \nfarms. This conceptual amendment adds technical language to bring everything \nback, be consistent, and still have the county milk commissions in each county.  \n \nMoving to new language in section 4, this was chosen as a combination of \nseveral other jurisdictions, mostly Oregon. Oregon has a functional small farm \nexemption,  and  we  used  pretty  much  the  same  language.  The  concept  in \nrespect to section 4 is direct farm sales for various small farms to the consumer \nthat do not go through the raw milk program.  \n \nBRITTNEY FRY:  \nI have been a Nevada resident since 2009. I have spent a lot of time and energy \nbuilding  up  my  homestead.  We  raise  all  of  our  own  meat  and  eggs  and \nwhenever  possible  our  own  dairy  products.  I  know  this  is  a  controversial \nsubject, but raw milk is already legal in Nevada. We want to make raw milk \nmore accessible for the people who want it. Right now there is a de facto ban, \nbecause the rural counties do not have a medical doctor or veterinarian to take \non one of those county commissions. There are some real concerns about raw \nmilk, but it is a choice that people should have the right to make, and a lot of \npeople want it. A lot of people are getting raw milk illegally anyway. We want \npeople to have a safe and legal way to get their hands on raw milk.  \n \nBRETT OTTOLENGHI (Artisanal Foods): \nI own a local business called Artisanal Foods, and I am an advocate for raw \nmilk. Along with gambling, marijuana and prostitution, raw milk has been legal \nin  Nevada  since  1979,  yet  only  one  of  these  consumer  choices  has  been \nrestricted, that being safely produced raw milk. The Southern Nevada Health \nDistrict (SNHD) has submitted a letter of opposition to this bill (Exhibit H). Their \nfirst point is testing one batch of raw milk only confirms that batch of milk and \ndoes not assure the next batch of milk will be free from disease causing germs. \nMy response to the SNHD's statement is, a dairy producing raw milk for direct \nhuman consumption, tests every cow and every batch of milk and each bottle \ncan be traced to a specific milking.  \n \nThe SNHD's second point is 81 percent of disease outbreaks reported occurred \nin states where the sale of raw milk was legal. There is no citation to this \nstatistic, and it does not appear on any U.S. Center for Disease Control and \nPrevention (CDC) document or on the internet. It is also conveniently vague, so \nit  is  meaningless  and  scary.  If  81  percent  of  all  types  of  disease  outbreak \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 24 \n \noccurred in states where raw milk is legal, that could be expected because \nabout 80 percent of the states have some form of legal raw milk.  \n \nThe third point is, in 71 percent of outbreaks, the raw milk came directly from \nthe dairy farm. This statistic is also not cited and is misleading. All milk starts as \nraw milk. This statistic does not look specifically at raw milk produced for direct \nconsumption. To get close to 71 percent of dairy-related outbreaks, they have \nincluded outbreaks from milk intended to be pasteurized, which ironically is the \nmilk  the  SNHD  prefers.  The  most  recent  major  dairy-related  outbreaks  are \nstatistics you can verify from the CDC's website. They were both in 2015 and \nboth from pasteurized milk products.  \n \nThousands of Nevadans are currently being forced into unsafe circumstances \nwhere they must transport their raw milk from any of our neighboring states, all \nof  which  have  legal  raw  milk.  This  usually  involves  a  long  commute  in \npassenger vehicles versus a regulated industry that would require refrigerated \ntransportation.  Senate  Bill  418  creates  a  legal  path  for  small  farms  across \nNevada to produce safe, sanitary, raw milk. To oppose this bill is to deny small \nfarms their most lucrative product and force Nevada consumers into a black \nmarket  without  any  regulation.  Raw  milk  has  been  legal  in  our  State  for \n40 years; it is time we keep our dollars in Nevada and begin serving the market \ndemand. I want to note the SNHD showed no opposition to the earlier poultry \nbill, yet poultry is literally hundreds of times more likely to cause a foodborne \nillness than raw milk. If they were logically consistent, they would require all \npoultry sold to be precooked.  \n \nSENATOR DAVID R. PARKS (Senatorial District No. 7): \nI am not sure I could add anything as I have not had the benefit of hearing the \nprevious testimony over S.B. 418. I want to express my support for this bill, \nand would like to go on record saying that I grew up on raw milk.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nLet me get this clear, raw milk is legal and it is legal in the surrounding states, \nbut something else is not legal, but is legal in all those surrounding states. What \nis the distinction from what the other states can do versus what we cannot do \nhere in Nevada? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 25 \n \nSENATOR OHRENSCHALL: \nAs I understand the situation in Nevada, while raw milk is legal, it is difficult to \nestablish the county milk commissions. The other provision of the amendment \nwould allow for herd shares, where consumers can have a share directly with a \nfarm and obtain raw milk. That is legal in many states; however, I am not sure if \nthat includes all of Nevada's neighboring states.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nRaw  milk  is  legal,  but  we  need  to  remove  the  barriers  of  the  county  milk \ncommissions and allow for herd shares, is that the bottom line? \n \nMR. OTTOLENGHI: \nSenate Bill 418 addresses two main problems. First of all, I created the only raw \ndairy commission in our State in 40 years. I did that in Nye County, and it was \nimpossibly difficult. For example, I had to create a rural regional veterinarians \nassociation,  because  there  was  not  one,  and  it  is  a  requirement  for  the \nveterinarian to be a member of this association. I called every physician who \nhas ever lived in Nye County to find one who met the requirements; it took \nyears. We want to make it easier to create these county milk commissions.  \n \nThe other issue is it allows raw milk to be transported across county lines. This \nis really important. No one is going to make the necessary investment to build a \nmodern sanitary raw milk dairy if they can only sell in one county. They are \ngoing to want to build such a dairy in a rural county where there are cows and \nfarmers and then sell the raw milk to a populous county. This bill addresses \nboth of those major concerns. \n \nMS. FRY: \nAnother  point  is  this  bill  would  remove  the  veterinary  and  medical  doctor \nrequirement. The rural counties that could not create a county milk commission \nbecause they lack the necessary people can now do that. This brings this ability \nto the rural counties.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nRaw milk  is legal. This just makes the  process of creating  the county milk \ncommission that provides the oversight actually possible? \n \nMS. FRY: \nIt makes it attainable. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 26 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nHow do you test the milk? \n \nSENATOR OHRENSCHALL: \nThe  statutory  requirements  are  in  NRS  584.205  and  NRS  584.208  which \ndeclares certified raw milk must meet certain bacteria levels and the conditions \nit must be stored. The proposed amendment would shift that from the NDA to \nthe county milk commission assuming they could be established. The proposed \namendment  would  make  it  so  that  a  county  milk  commission  could  be \nestablished. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIf one takes away the veterinarian and the medical doctor, who is the one to \ncount the bacteria levels? \n \nSENATOR OHRENSCHALL: \nEach county commission, when it establishes a county milk commission, could \ncertainly  create  regulations  for  contracting  with  a  medical  doctor  or  a \nveterinarian. Requiring a resident of that county to be a veterinarian or medical \ndoctor has proven insurmountable in our less populous counties. I believe safety \ncan  be  guaranteed  with  this  bill,  and  each  county  milk  commission  could \ncertainly contract with a medical doctor in Reno or Las Vegas. I am not saying \nwe should not have that type of expertise to guarantee safety for the consumer; \nit is just the current structure needs to be changed. Nevada has a product that \nis legal but unobtainable.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWhat is the issue of crossing state lines? \n \nSENATOR OHRENSCHALL: \nI believe the issue was crossing county lines. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWhat I heard was people were crossing state lines to buy raw milk. I can speak \nfor  northern  Nevada,  folks  are  going  to  Plumas  County  to  purchase  these \nproducts. So what is the county line part of S.B. 418? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 27 \n \nSENATOR OHRENSCHALL: \nIf the bill were to become law, you could have raw milk in Douglas County that \ncould be sold to consumers in Washoe County. You would not be limited to \nDouglas County. If this were to pass, crossing state lines, where people are \ndriving over, purchasing raw milk in their car and bringing it back to Nevada \nwith  a  bag  of  ice  to  keep  it  cool,  would  end.  I  think  that  is  a  dangerous \nsituation.  I  think  this  would  cure  that  situation.  We  have  constituents  who \nbelieve in raw milk. They are purchasing it and are not complying with the NRS \nand are putting themselves in danger. We should have a system where people \ncould obtain it legally in Nevada. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs anyone here in support of S.B. 418? \n \nJAMI HEPWORTH: \nI am in favor of S.B. 418. My family and I have been happily consuming raw \nmilk for the past four years. I moved to Nevada in July from Pocatello, Idaho, \nwhere my husband completed his family medicine residency. He is a doctor and \nhe supports this. In Idaho, we had been buying raw milk from local farmers who \nknew every one of their cow's names. Imagine my surprise when moving to \nNevada where prostitution, gambling and marijuana are legal, but because of the \nde facto ban here, I could not buy raw milk. My options were to spend more \nthan double what I did in Idaho, California or on the black market in Nevada or \nto get my own dairy animals.  \n \nI chose to remain a law abiding citizen and am now a proud owner of Nubian \ngoats; one of which I milk every morning and her name is Amelia. Raw milk is \nnot only safe when properly handled, but it is nutritious. Doctor Weston A. Price \nis one of the most prominent health researchers in the twentieth century and \nauthor  of  Nutrition  and  Physical  Degeneration.  Dr.  Price  found  by  studying \nindigenous  people  that  modern  highly  processed  diets  caused  physical \ndegeneration. As these indigenous people started to add these modern highly \nprocessed  foods  to  their  diet,  their  previous  excellent  health  degenerated.  I \nrecommend you use this book as an excellent and interesting resource. This is \nwhy I believe that raw milk is a healthy and nutritious practice. I am not trying \nto convince anyone to drink raw milk, but this is the reason that I drink raw \nmilk. Not everyone is fortunate enough to have access to land, or have the \nfinancial and time resources to house and milk their own dairy animals, but \neveryone should have legal access to this traditional food. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 28 \n \nIf  you  do  not  agree  with  my  food  choices,  I  would  like  the  Committee  to \nconsider  we  still  protect  clearly  harmful  health  choices  in  other  areas.  For \nexample, we have 480,000 people die annually from first-hand cigarette smoke \nand 41,000 from second-hand cigarette smoke. We have 88,000 people die \nfrom  alcohol  consumption,  5,000  of  which  are  under  age.  One  in  every \nfive deaths in the United States is due to tobacco. The top three causes of \npreventable deaths are tobacco, poor diet and physical inactivity and alcohol \nconsumption. These causes are perfectly legal.  \n \nSome opponents might cite fear of bacteria in their arguments against raw milk, \nbut this is not a problem with proper milk handling procedures. The truth is the \nblanket  fear  of  bacteria  has  created  its  own  set  of  issues  in  our  Country. \nNamely, we have 23,000 deaths in the United States from antibiotic resistant \ninfections. We need to naturally boost our immune systems through exposure to \nmicrobes, which traditionally cultured foods can offer. If you do not want to \nconsume raw milk in the name of safety, that is okay. I doubt you would ban \nalcohol  and  tobacco  in  the  name  of  safety  and  health.  This  issue  is  about \nfreedom and legal access to choose.  \n \nJAUNITA COX (Citizens in Action): \nMany, including myself, were raised on raw milk, cheese and butter. We liked \nraw foods. We got all the good stuff from the animals, the ground and directly \nfrom the farm. We supported a similar bill in 2013, and we got it through every \nhouse and then the Governor vetoed it. In the blink of an eye all of our hopes \nwere dashed; we went back to the underground. We the consumers of raw milk \nand products need this bill, so we do not have to stay in the black market and \nbreak the law.  \n \nRUSS JAMES (District Council 16 Painters and Allied Trades): \nI am a raw milk advocate and a 20-plus year drinker of raw milk. I worked with \nBrittney Fry on the amendment. We are in support of S.B. 418.  \n \nMS. OGAN: \nI am in support of S.B. 418. My family and I have been drinking raw milk for \nabout ten years; we have our own animals. This is another opportunity for small \nfarms to have another product for people who want wholesome local good \nfood. It will help my family farm. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 29 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs there anyone in opposition of S.B. 418? \n \nDOUG BUSSELMAN (Nevada Farm Bureau Federation):  \nI am the Executive Vice President of the Nevada Farm Bureau Federation. We \nare opposed to S.B. 418. Our organizational policy supports only pasteurized \nfluid milk being sold or distributed for human consumption. I will defer to the \nresearch and statistics by the CDC and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. \nThere are a number of needless risks associated with raw milk consumption. \nIncreasing authorization for the sale of raw milk has resulted in consequences of \nmore  outbreaks  of  health  problems.  Pasteurization  of  milk  for  human \nconsumption is a very sound policy, and we believe Nevada requirements should \nbe maintained.  \n \nI am not aware of the amendment. I do not know how those logistics will work. \nI encourage the Committee to look at what the federal requirements might be \nrather  than  transmitting  unpasteurized  milk  directly  for  human  consumption \nacross State lines. I understand within Nevada there may be provisions that \ncould deal with things differently, but I believe there are federal regulations in \nlaw that prohibit the transfer of raw milk across state lines. The Nevada Farm \nBureau Federation is opposed to changing Nevada law to allow for the sale of \nraw unpasteurized milk for human consumption.  \n \nCHAD WESTOM (Director, Environmental Health Services, Washoe County Health \nDistrict):  \nWe are opposed to S.B. 418 because of the public health and food safety \nconcerns of consuming raw milk. Our government affairs liaison did speak to \none of the bill's sponsors and talked about our concerns. We have not had the \nopportunity to review the amendment. As the bill is currently written, it would \nallow for the possibility of raw, unpasteurized milk to be distributed outside of \nNye County and throughout Nevada and into Washoe County.  \n \nRaw milk is scientifically inherently dangerous. Raw milk may contain a number \nof pathogens which may include; Staphylococcus, Campylobacter, Salmonella, \nE. coli, Listeria, to name a few. Pasteurized milk is healthy and prevents harmful \nexposure  to  these  pathogens.  According  to  the  association  of  state  and \nterritorial  health  officials,  foodborne  illnesses  have  had  an  impact  on  our \neconomy. It is estimated the cost of foodborne illness in the United States is \nover  $77  billion  including  medical  costs,  loss  of  productivity,  mortality  and \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 30 \n \noutbreaks associated with raw milk are no exception. For example, there was a \n2008  economic  outbreak  of  E.  coli  linked  to  raw  milk  in  Connecticut.  This \noutbreak resulted in estimated medical expenses of $413,402. Our concern is \nwith those most at risk consuming raw and unpasteurized milk which are young \nchildren. There are outbreaks that involve children younger than five years old. \nIn  the  Connecticut  outbreak.  There  were  young  children  who  experienced \nserious complications.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nCan you articulate what is different between Nevada and its neighboring states \nwhere there seems to be small scale sales of raw milk and no problems?  \n \nMR. WESTOM: \nI  cannot  really  comment  on  that.  Washoe  County  investigates  foodborne \noutbreaks and sometimes it takes a long time to determine the source of a \nfoodborne outbreak. We will be looking into that and if we find something I will \nbe sure and forward that to your office.  \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nWe  have  heard  testimony  where  people  have  gone  over  the  State  line  and \nbought raw milk. We have not heard of any foodborne outbreaks. Have you \ndetermined there is something significant in terms of foodborne outbreaks or \nhealth risk in states surrounding Nevada where raw milk is legal? \n \nMR. WESTOM: \nThere is a lot of scientific information on the internet. The SNDH put comments \nin Exhibit H. Nevada does not have widespread raw milk, and we are not seeing \nthat as a problem. It is our hope that we can keep it that way. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThat was not my question. My question is the states around Nevada that are \nclose enough for people to go to that state and get the raw milk and return to \nNevada. Have those states seen a significant outbreak of foodborne illnesses \nconnected to raw milk? \n \nMR. WESTOM: \nI do not have that information. I will look into it.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 31 \n \nKARLA SHOUP (Environment Health Manager, Southern Nevada Health District): \nSouthern Nevada Health District serves as the public health authority for the \njurisdictions of Clark County, City of Las Vegas, Boulder City, Henderson, North \nLas  Vegas,  Mesquite  and  Laughlin.  You  have  received  our  written  position, \nExhibit H, on this matter. I want to reiterate SNHD opposes any legislation that \nallows for the sale of unpasteurized milk for human consumption. Pasteurization \ninsures that harmful pathogens such as Brucella, Campylobacter, Salmonella, \nLister, Mycobacterium bovis and E. coli are destroyed. These pathogens can be \ntransmitted by healthy animals and missed by batch testing procedures.  \n \nSENATOR OHRENSCHALL: \nIn  the  proposed  amendment,  the  Director  of  the  NDA  would  still  be \npromulgating the regulations in regards to testing even though the county milk \ncommissions  would  have  a  change  in  its  composition.  The  NDA  would  still \npromulgate those regulations. There is already extensive Nevada Administrative \nCodes 584.2031 through 584.2151 detailing tests and what testing certified \nraw milk should have. This bill does not propose to change any of that.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 418 and open the hearing on S.B. 430. \n \nSENATE BILL 430: Expanding the definition of “chronic or debilitating medical \ncondition” for certain purposes related to the medical use of marijuana. \n(BDR 40-1152) \n \nSENATOR NICOLE J. CANNIZZARO (Senatorial District No. 6): \nSenate  Bill  430  expands  the  list  in  which  medical  marijuana  may  be \nrecommended for patients. I would like to introduce Dr. Carmen Jones, who \ntreats patients who use medical marijuana to treat a number of ailments and \ndiseases.  Dr.  Jones  is  a  licensed  physician  and  also  a  medicinal  cannabis \npractitioner here in Nevada where she has been working almost exclusively with \nmedical cannabis patients. At this point, I want to walk through the bill for the \nCommittee. \n \nSenate  Bill  430  is  a  pretty  straightforward  bill.  Section  1  amends \nNRS 453A.050 to add the following conditions to the \"chronic or debilitating \nmedical condition\" to include: an anxiety disorder; an autism spectrum disorder; \nan autoimmune disease; anorexia nervosa; and dependence upon or addiction to \nopioids. It makes changes within some of those definitions: \"persistent muscle \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 32 \n \nspasms\" is changed to \"muscle spasms\" and \"severe nausea\" to \"nausea\". It \nadds: chronic pain and any condition related to the human immunodeficiency \nvirus  and  neuropathic  condition  whether  or  not  such  a  condition  causes \nseizures.  \n \nSince this list was created, I have talked to Dr. Jones and there may be a small \namendment  to  ensure  the  language  for  the  disorders  match  her  clinical \nexperience.  Specifically,  the  language  anorexia  nervosa  should  not  be  in \nsection 1,  subsection  5,  but  should  be  added  to  section  1,  subsection  9, \ncachexia. This better describes the conditions that result in no appetite or an \ninability to eat, similar to symptoms you may see with cancer patients.  \n \nWe  also  want  to  be  clear  the  language  of  a  disease  related  to  the  human \nimmunodeficiency virus does include those patients who are HIV positive, as \nwell as those diagnosed with AIDS. We believe the language in the bill does that \nbut want to have this on the record.  \n \nWe want inclusion of neuropathic diseases regardless of whether they cause \nseizures. This is not meant to be duplicative of the current language which \nallows such a recommendation for seizures regardless of whether or not they \nare  caused  by  epilepsy.  There  is  some  overlap  where  those  diagnoses  may \noccur  for  a  practitioner,  which  I  am  sure  Dr.  Jones  can  describe.  We  just \nwanted the record to be clear; it is meant to get at both of those things even \nthough there may be some overlap.  \n \nCARMEN JONES, M.D.  \nI have been a licensed physician for 28 years and for 17 of those years in \nLas Vegas. I have been seeing patients for medicinal cannabis for seven years. \nIn that time, when I am at my busiest, I could see over 100 patients in a week. \nWith  that  experience,  I  have  been  able  to  look  and  see  what  the  current \nrecommendations  were  and  see  what  was  needed  for  improvement.  This  is \nwhat the Committee has in front of them.  \n \nThis is actually quite straightforward. I will explain what the differences are and \nwhat  should  be  added.  The  anxiety  disorder  mentioned  in  section  1, \nsubsection 2,  is  probably  the  most  common  situation  that  we  see  for  this \ncondition. Many people at one time or another will have anxiety, and cannabis \nactually works quite well for people with anxiety. However, as it stands today, \nthat  is  not  one  of  the  qualifications.  Unless  the  patient  has  an  associated \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 33 \n \nsymptom, they are not able to be approved for medical marijuana and a lot of \npeople are turned away.  \n \nIn  regard  to  autism  spectrum  disorders,  there  is  a  lot  of  research  on  how \ncannabis, especially in a cannabidiol (CBD) form, can help children with autism. \nThere are many associated conditions with autism, mainly seizures. One child \nhad not only autism seizures but also had an autoimmune condition. He was \nthree years old and used CBD to help with his autism. It helped his seizure and \nhis autoimmune condition.  \n \nIn  regard  to  autoimmune  conditions,  these  are  very  responsive  to  cannabis. \nMany patients with conditions such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, all benefit \nfrom it.  \n \nIn regard to anorexia nervosa; I hope that was clear. The nervosa suggests an \nentirely different condition meaning that is a psychological diagnosis with many \ndifferent factors and that is not the intention. The intention is to use the term \nanorexia in its basic symptomatic term which is poor appetite. That term applies \nto people with multiple chronic conditions. If they cannot eat because they have \nanorexia or poor appetite, they often become cachectic. Cannabis is known to \nbe helpful to increase someone's appetite.  \n \nI  will  end  with  the  section  that  may  need  some  clarification,  which  is \nneuropathic conditions. I was trying to be broad in my reason to write this, \nbecause  there  are  so  many  neuropathic  conditions  that  can  be  helped  by \ncannabis. There is a YouTube video showing someone with Parkinson's disease; \nhe takes just a little cannabis and his tremors go away. This video is accurate. \nNeuropathic conditions can happen with or without seizures. The language is an \nattempt to broaden this condition without being so specific.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWhy medicinal? Is that because it is now legal? \n \nDR. JONES: \nThe people selling the products in the dispensaries are not physicians nor are \nthey  medical  people.  They  may  be  well  versed  with  the  plant  but  not  the \nmedical components that allow the two to work together. I am a big advocate \nof maintaining this medical program and plan to expand it. I want to educate \npeople properly on how to use this product and hopefully more of my colleagues \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 34 \n \nwill get past the stigma and join me. I want to allow patients to have more \nappropriate products for the medical needs that they have, rather than rely on \nthe advice of people working at the dispensaries. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIs it cheaper to get marijuana medically? \n \nDR. JONES: \nAs of now, yes. It is cheaper because of the tax break, I am not sure exactly of \nwhat that break is.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will answer that question. There is the cost of the medical marijuana card of \n$100.  You get a  10 percent discount  when you buy marijuana for  medical \nreasons and if that adds up to $100 savings at the register over the course of a \nyear, then it is worth doing.  \n \nThe other important point is the grow facilities and the production facilities need \nto see evidence there is a market for medical marijuana. This would encourage \nthem to invest in the plants and products to meet the needs of the medical \npatient and not solely focused on the recreational patient. \n \nDR. JONES: \nMedical marijuana patients tend to use a lot more cannabis. Many will take the \nmarijuana  flower  and  make  their  own  products,  and  that  is  quite  a  bit  of \nmedicine.  They  totally  save  money  after  purchasing  the  card.  They  tend  to \nconsume  more  and  stronger  products  and  in  different  ways.  I  hope  there \ncontinues to be a large variety of products.  \n \nMADISON SAGLIBENE (Nevada Chapter, National Organization for the Reform of \nMarijuana Laws): \nI am the Executive Director of the Nevada Chapter of the National Organization \nfor the Reform of Marijuana Laws. This bill would help an insane amount of \nconstituents  get  legal  relief  as  opposed  to  going  through  the  recreational \nprogram. Medical protections and tax breaks are important.  \n \nROBERT COHEN (Cohen Medical Centers): \nI am the owner of Cohen Medical Centers in support of S.B. 430. We have been \nhelping medical cannabis patients since 2009. We take care of thousands of \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 35 \n \npatients, and the added conditions are necessary. In answer to Senator Hardy's \nquestion, the autism spectrum usually affects folks under the age of 18 and \nthey would have to have a medical card. They could not get medical cannabis \notherwise.  The  other  benefits  of  the  medical  cannabis  card  are  selection, \nprotection and price. They get better products, better prices and they do not \nhave to stand in line. The conditions that are on this list are necessary. We do \nnot want to turn people away from using cannabis; we do not want them to lie \non the forms and say they have one condition when that is not what they have.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWhen you talked about protection, was that federal or State? \n \nMR. COHEN: \nIt is just State protection. \n \nLENNORA VALLES (Coalition for Patient Rights): \nWe support this bill. I think this will help get more patients on the medical \nmarijuana  program  and  bring  more  medical  marijuana  products  to  the \ndispensaries. I cannot find any suppositories and those are used for colon and \npancreatic cancer. The patients cannot get this. Many patients cannot grow so \nthey cannot make their own. They have to form collectives just to get the \nmedicine they need. This should help expand the product in the dispensaries for \nthe medical marijuana patients. \n \nRIANA DURRETT (Nevada Dispensary Association): \nWe support this bill. When our medical marijuana program was enacted, it was \nbased on projections of 100,000 patients within the first 2 years. Our program \npeaked at about 26,000 patients; we now have about 17,000 patients. Our \nentire medical program is in danger.  We support anything that can make it \neasier for the patients.  \n \nASH-LEE CATCHO (Coalition for Patient Rights): \nI am native Hawaiian. I have lived in Nevada for three years. I grew up in Hawaii \nand natives like myself believe in holistic healing. I am here because my mom is \n62 years old and this is the only medicine she uses; she does not go to a \npharmacy. She still does marathons; she is healthy and has not gone to the \nhospital. I grew up thinking my mom was doing a bad thing—that my mom was \ndoing a drug. My mom is 62 and does not look her age. I never understood why \nmy mom kept calling it medication.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 36 \n \nI am not a user. I was always told people just want to get high. Now I think \nbeing high is just a side effect of the medicine. If you got medicine from the \npharmacy, you could get vomiting or diarrhea as side effects. Now when I think \nabout side effects, I think it is better for my mom to get high and be healthy. I \nam here as someone watching a family member use it and not having to worry \nabout them going in the hospital, because it has kept my mom healthy and out \nof a hospital.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 430 and open the hearing on S.B. 477. \n \nSENATE BILL 477: Prohibits the release of a child to a parent or guardian in \ncertain circumstances. (BDR 38-1005) \n \nSENATOR JAMES A. SETTELMEYER (Senatorial District No. 17): \nSenate Bill 477 relates to releasing a child to a parent or guardian who has been \nconvicted of child abuse, neglect or endangerment. There are several judges in \nmy community who have told me about problems where they had to release a \nchild or were told to release a child to a person who they knew had been \nconvicted of child abuse, neglect or endangerment. There is a problem with the \nNRS. This bill seeks to close this \"loophole.\"  \n \nCurrently, Nevada law prohibits a court from releasing a child who has been \nplaced in protective custody to a parent or guardian who has been convicted of \nchild  abuse,  neglect  or  endangerment  unless  the  court  finds  clear  and \nconvincing evidence that releasing the child to the parent or guardian will not \nresult in physical or psychological harm to the child. However, this bill seeks to \nexpand the prohibition to apply to releasing \"any\" child to a parent or guardian \nwho has been convicted of child abuse, neglect or endangerment regardless of \nwhether the child has been placed in protective custody. It will also expand the \nprohibition to a parent or guardian who has been convicted or adjudicated of \nchild abuse, neglect or endangerment in another jurisdiction.  \n \nThe issue these judges have encountered in Douglas County is that the county \nborders California. They are having to look at the California jurisdictions. Some \njudges have had to break the law rather than release that child to a potentially \nharmful environment. One judge said \"I am not going to release the child into a \nharmful situation. I would rather disobey the law. If you do not like it, take me \nto jail.\" In that respect, we just want to change the law to where the judge can \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 37 \n \nsay no; we can see you have had adjudications from other courts. I have talked \nto colleagues in Clark County and they have the same problem. Judge Sullivan \nis in the audience down south and would like to testify on this matter.  \n \nFRANK P. SULLIVAN (Juvenile Court Judge, Family Division, Eighth Judicial District \nCourt):  \nI preside over child abuse and neglect cases. The reason for NRS 432B is the \nchild protective act. It keeps children safe. The intent of NRS 432B.555 was to \nprotect  children.  If  a  parent  has  been  convicted  of  child  abuse,  neglect  or \nendangerment, this makes sure the court addresses this and does not put the \nchild in harm's way.  \n \nThe key provision is not the jurisdiction in which the parent or guardian has \nbeen convicted but rather the fact they have been convicted of child abuse, \nneglect  or  endangerment,  because  that  directly  impacts  the  safety  and \nwellbeing of the child. I support this bill because it makes common sense and \ncloses any loopholes.  \n \nThe  intent  is  the  parent  \"has\"  been  convicted  of  child  abuse,  neglect  or \nendangerment not \"where\" they have been convicted. This bill addresses any \nchild. As the NRS is currently written, it only looks at a child who is a direct \nvictim of abuse, neglect or endangerment. In this bill, it would apply to any child \nwithin  that  home.  If  that  parent  has  been  convicted  of  abuse,  neglect  or \nendangerment the court could consider any child including siblings before it \nmade a determination to release that child or any other child to those parents.  \n \nALEX ORTIZ (Clark County): \nWe are in support of S.B. 477. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 477. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN MOVED TO DO PASS S.B. 477. \n \nSENATOR WOODHOUSE SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * * * * * \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 38 \n \nChair Ratti: \nSeeing no further business, we are adjourned at 6:33 p.m. \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nMichelle Hamilton, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2019 \nPage 39 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nExhibit / \nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \n# of pages \n  A  2    Agenda \n  B  7    Attendance Roster \nS.B. 390  C  9  Senator Ira Hansen   Proposed Amendment \nS.B. 390  D  10  Randy Robison  Slide Presentation \nS.B. 390  E  3  Sue Kennedy  Testimony \nS.B. 293  F  2  Senator Julia Ratti  Proposed Amendment \nS.B. 418  G  7  Senator David R Parks  Proposed Amendment \nSouthern Nevada Health \nS.B. 418  H  2  Testimony \nDistrict \n ", "28": "\nMINUTES OF THE  \nSENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n \nEightieth Session \nApril 10, 2019 \n \n \nThe Senate Committee on Health and Human Services was called to order by \nChair Julia Ratti at 4:19 p.m. on Wednesday, April 10, 2019, in Room 2134 of \nthe  Legislative  Building,  Carson City,  Nevada.

CANCELA (Senatorial District No. 10): \nI am here today to present S.B. 283 for your consideration. \n \nSenate  Bill  283  revises  statutory  language  related  to  the  list  of  preferred \nprescription drugs used by the Medicaid Program. Federal law requires Medicaid \nto cover all prescription drugs approved by the United Stated Food and Drug \nAdministration. This bill gives the Department of Health and Human Services \n(DHHS) more flexibility in developing Medicaid's list of preferred prescription \ndrugs and in negotiating favorable rates for the State and its taxpayers. \n \nSince 2010, the Legislature has been passing short-term fixes that sunset every \ntwo years. This bill aims to address this issue for the long term. Senate Bill 283 \nwill increase access to certain drugs and allow Medicaid to consider not only the \nclinical  efficacy  and  safety  of  certain  prescription  drugs  but  also  their  cost \neffectiveness. \n \nShould Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 422.4025 sunset on June 30, 2019, we \nwill  revert  to  pre-2010  requirements.  This  will  tie  the  hands  of  the  State \nMedicaid agency to negotiate the prices it pays for certain drugs. Given the \nexponential increases in the cost of prescription drugs in recent years, this is \nnot  a  good  situation  for  Medicaid  beneficiaries  or  taxpayers.  The  changes \noutlined in S.B. 283 will enable Medicaid to reduce costs, better serve recipients \nand spend taxpayer dollars more efficiently. \n \nThis  bill  expands  the  scope  of  the  existing  Prescription  Monitoring  Program \n(PMP) which currently tracks prescriptions for controlled substances listed in \nSchedules II, III, IV and V. They are filled by a registered pharmacy or dispensed \nby a registered practitioner to track every prescription regardless of whether the \ndrug prescribed is a controlled substance. \n \nThis  bill  is  important  for  Nevadans  who  receive  health  insurance  coverage \nthrough Medicaid. It will expand their access to prescription drugs and improve \nthe bottom line as the State purchases these drugs with taxpayer dollars. \n \nI have submitted a conceptual amendment (Exhibit C) which will be reviewed by \nMs. Beth Slamowitz. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 4 \n \nBETH SLAMOWITZ (Senior Policy Advisor on Pharmacy, Department of Health and \nHuman Services): \nI am a Doctor of Pharmacy serving as Senior Advisor on Pharmacy in the DHHS \nand will read from my written testimony (Exhibit D). \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWhat is the impact on patients if their drug is not on the preferred list?  \n \nMS. SLAMOWITZ: \nIf the drug is on the preferred list, it requires no preauthorization process to \nreceive the medication. If the drug is on the nonpreferred list, it would require \nthe prior authorization process and require the individual to show whether or not \nthey have a drug interaction, an allergy or have tried other products. If it is a \ncontinuity of care issue and the patient has been on the medication for a period \nof time, the physician can show medical necessity in order for the patient to \nreceive the drug. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe easier path is to have the drug on the preferred list. If a patient needs to \ncontinue to take a medication on the nonpreferred list, they will require a prior \nauthorization and the physician will have to prove the reason for continuity of \ncare. Is there any difference in price to the consumer? \n \nMS. SLAMOWITZ: \nThat is correct; there is no cost difference to the consumer. \n  \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe way NRS is written there is a list of drugs mandatorily on a preferred list.  \n \nMS. SLAMOWITZ: \nThat  is  correct.  Through  June  30,  2019,  the  current  NRS  states  there  are \ncertain classes of medications that need to be excluded from the preferred drug \nlist.  There  are  three  classes:  human  immunodeficiency  virus  medications, \nanti-hemophilia medications and the anti-rejection medications. Medications that \nhad been approved by Medicaid prior to June 30, 2010, are to be excluded from \nthe preferred drug list. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 5 \n \nCHAIR RATTI:  \nMedicaid  is  going  through  a  process  of  negotiating  with  pharmaceutical \ncompanies to bring a higher level of rebates which brings down the cost of a \ndrug. If that drug is protected by NRS, we have no negotiating power as a \nState.  \n \nMS. SLAMOWITZ: \nThat is correct. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThis bill seeks to provide the State with better negotiating power by saying we \ncannot have a conversation about these pharmaceuticals. \n \nMS. SLAMOWITZ: \nThat is correct. To continue what we have been doing since 2010, we are \naddressing the medications on the preferred drug list with the exception of the \nthree I mentioned previously. Based on the sunset language, as of July 1, 2019, \nthat would change. This bill would allow us to continue the flexibility to manage \nthe benefit as we have been. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe have been dealing with this for some time and continue to extend for two \nyears, we need to act on it. If we do nothing, the bill does not pass and we do \nnot address the sunset issue. Where does that leave us? \n \nMS. SLAMOWITZ: \nAs NRS states, as of July 1, 2019, the three excluded classes, along with \nanticonvulsants, antipsychotics and antidiabetics, would all be excluded from \nthe preferred drug list. We would not be able to address those from a clinical or \ncost standpoint. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWhy does this need to happen in a closed meeting? \n \nMS. SLAMOWITZ: \nThere is federal statute that those negotiations with federal manufacturers are \nproprietary, requiring the closed door session. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 6 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIf we are not able to have these negotiations, we have tied our hands. We are \nspending  more  State  dollars  on  our  pharmaceuticals  than  we  should  be; \ntherefore, we cannot afford to do other things. \n \nMS. SLAMOWITZ: \nThat is correct. \n \nVIVIAN LEAL: \nI am a multiple sclerosis (MS) patient, advocate and lead person for Indivisible \nNorthern Nevada. We understand the need for this bill to avoid a disaster. We \nwant costs to go down. We understand certain procedures need to come into \neffect  when  we  have  duplication  of  cost  categories.  However,  we  are \nconcerned for MS patients on Medicaid.  \n \nThere  are  many  new  drugs  being  released,  but  the  side  effect  profiles  are \ndifferent  and  something  every  person  is  struggling  to  work  out  with  their \nphysicians in terms of which drug to take. It is often trial and error. We can \nstabilize a patient if a drug is not on the formulary. To move the patient to a \nnew drug opens an immune system window. Immune system diseases are not \nthe same as other diseases. A person who is walking one day can be back in a \nwheelchair within three months.  \n \nI have provided a graph (Exhibit E) so you can see the prices we are talking \nabout. In recent years, we had a new generic drug available. The lowest price \nfor that generic is now $23,775 per year for 2019. Medications I was started \non in 1999 are at $90,000 per year for 2019. You can see how the MS patient \nwould  be  frightened  of  cost  corrections  and  how  long  the  preauthorization \nprocess would take in terms of continuity of care. Time is mobility for MS \npatients.  \n \nWe understand the need for this bill. There is no rationality for the cost basis of \nthese medications. Congress has done a study on this and I will submit it for \nyour review. A lot of the rebates are a racket that, unfortunately, we must \naccept. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 7 \n \nCONNOR CAIN (Carrara Group LLC; Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers \nof America): \nPharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America is opposed to S.B. 283. \n \nASHER LISEC (Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America): \nCurrently, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America is opposed to \nS.B. 283. We have had an opportunity with the author's office and the Division \nof Health Care Financing and Policy (DHCFP) to better understand the intent of \nthe  bill.  We  appreciate  how  conceptual  amendment  1  allows  the  DHHS \ndiscretion when it comes to the protected classes.  \n \nWe will be asking for an additional amendment to clarify the closed door piece \nso the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee would only include discussions \nabout  the  proprietary  negotiations.  Our  concern  is  making  sure  patients, \nproviders and others in the community have the opportunity to speak their voice \nand ensure the rationale for making decisions about how formulary placement is \nmade transparent to the public. With this additional amendment, we would be \nneutral on the bill. \n \nLIZ MACMENAMIN (Retail Association of Nevada): \nThe Retail Association of Nevada has mixed feelings on S.B. 283. I feel an \nownership  to  the  piece  on  the  protected  classes  and  the  Pharmacy  and \nTherapeutics Committee. In the past, the Retail Association of Nevada worked \nwith Assemblywomen McClain and Koivisto to bring help with respect to cost \nsavings. We accepted the protected classes at that point and negotiated with \nthe manufacturers because of the concern with the protected classes. We do \nsupport this portion of the bill.  \n \nThe sunset has been going on each year since 2010, and we have looked at a \nsunset each session since then. The Retail Association of Nevada has stayed \nout of that. \n \nWe do oppose the piece on the PMP. The Retail Association of Nevada was not \nmade aware of this until two hours ago. Until today, we were not given an \nopportunity  to  discuss  our  concerns  with  the  individuals  bringing  the  bill \nforward. I am working on information for the Committee to help you understand \nwhat  the  cost  to  the  pharmacy  will  be.  We  have  concerns  about  security \nbreaches and what is to be done with the information. This is protected health \ninformation.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 8 \n \nI was told, that currently, they would not be able to accept an amendment. I do \nwant to state the Nevada PMP, another thing the Retail Association of Nevada \nwas  instrumental  in  implementing,  is  a  database  regarding  information  for \ncontrolled substances. We would hate to dilute the information in that database. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe do have a database for opioids or controlled substances, correct? We have \ngotten valuable data to understand purchasing patterns and policy level decision \nmaking  information.  What  is  the  challenge  with  expanding  that  to  other \npharmaceuticals? \n \nMS. MACMENAMIN: \nI  am  gathering  the  information  to  find  out  what  the  cost  would  be  to  the \npharmacy. There will be a cost to implement this on the grand scale. Walgreens \nspends more than the U. S. Department of Defense on electronic privacy and \nissues with technology to ensure their databases are safe.  \n \nMy concern would be the safety of the patient information, the cost incurred by \nthe member and what it would cost to implement. There was a cost involved in \nother states and in initially setting up the PMP. Dave Wuest with the Nevada \nState Board of Pharmacy may have more information on the State side. There \nwill be a big expense incurred on the stakeholder's side. \n \nThere has been a breach in the past where the State was sued. Would the State \nbe able to offer unlimited liability for incorrect information? \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThe  Commerce  and  Labor  Committee  just  passed  S.B. 21  related  to \ncybersecurity. Once it gets through the Assembly, I believe it will address, if not \nall, 98 percent of your concerns. It will tighten security for personal information \nas well as health information. \n \nSENATE BILL 21: Enacts the Insurance Data Security Law. (BDR 57-221) \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nAre we talking about putting all medications under the PMP? \n \nMS. MACMENAMIN: \nThat is my understanding. They want to collect all data. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 9 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nAs a physician, will I have to enter all of this information in to the PMP? \n \nMS. MACMENAMIN: \nI  do  not  believe  you  would  have  to  enter  the  information  yourself.  The \npharmacies will be the ones to enter the information in to the database for \neverything that is prescribed. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nLogistically, as I check the PMP periodically, will I see everything? \n \nCHAIR RATI: \nMr. Wuest, will you be able to help us with this information? \n \nDAVE WUEST (Deputy Secretary, Nevada State Board of Pharmacy): \nI  am  neutral  on  this  bill.  The  PMP  is  co-administered  between  the  Nevada \nInvestigation  Division  (NID)  and  the  Nevada  Board  of  Pharmacy.  The  NID \nhandles law enforcement of the proper use of the PMP. We have had no issues \nin the 25 years the PMP has been used in Nevada. This does not mean we will \nnot have an issue. \n \nThe State Board has been sued three times since the inception of the PMP. We \nwere found not guilty in each case. We recently had a case linked to a doctor \nwho used it inappropriately. These things do come up, and we address them \nappropriately.  \n \nSenator Hardy, regarding your question about entering information into the PMP, \nif this moves forward, we would have the capability of not showing you the \ndata unless you chose to see it.  \n \nThe long-term goal of the DHHS is not only to do surveillance that is required on \nsuch things as antibiotic and cardiac events but to do medication reconciliation. \nIf, through integration, we were able to migrate this data to the prescriber, you \nwould be able to see what the medication prescribed for the patient looks like.  \n \nThis would be an opt-in situation not a mandate. There is no mandate in this bill \nyou would need to review before prescribing a medication. In the hospitals, \nmedication reconciliation is a challenge, and this data would potentially help \nthem. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 10 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIs this working seamlessly elsewhere, and are all doctors happy with it? \n \nMR. WUEST: \nThere  are  always  issues  with  technology.  As  far  as  I  know,  Nebraska  is \ncollecting the data without issue. We spoke with our vendor, and we can handle \nthe data. There will be an expense on both sides, and we have placed a fiscal \nnote with an amount yet to be determined. The goal would be to potentially use \ngrants to fund the program. \n \nELISA  CAFFERATA  (Biotechnology  Innovation  Organization;  Planned  Parenthood \nVotes Nevada): \nI  am  representing  two  companies  today,  the  first  being  Biotechnology \nInnovation Organization, which is the trade organization for biopharmaceutical \ndrugs. We do have our comments on the record dealing with protected classes. \nThe  issue  is  the  negotiations  around  protected  classes  do  not  just  affect \nnegotiating the price. They impact how patients can access those drugs and \nwhether  they  have  to  go  through  the  preauthorization  and  step  therapy \nprocesses. One of the reasons these drugs have ended up in a protected class is \nso  when  patients  find  something  that  works  for  them  they  can  keep  it \nconsistent.  \n \nToday,  I  am  also  representing  Planned  Parenthood  Votes  Nevada.  We  are \nconcerned. I have raised this concern with the sponsors about a database where \npeople can go and, out of curiosity, look people up. We are more concerned \nabout  the  people  having  access  to  these  databases  randomly  looking  up \ninformation on family or friends than a massive data breach. Those are the kinds \nof  breaches  we  see  along  with  the  Health  Insurance  Portability  and \nAccountability  Act  violations.  They  are  much  more  personal  and  individual. \nWhile we understand those things are against the law, it does create serious \nproblems for our patients.  \n \nJEANETTE K. BELZ (Nevada Psychiatric Association): \nPrior to 2010, the DHHS was required to exclude drugs such as atypical and \ntypical antipsychotics from any restrictions on their list. Financially, in 2010, \nthey were looking for ways to add money to the budget. They came to the \nLegislature and convinced them, for a period of time, to exclude atypical and \ntypical antipsychotics from the restricted drug list. They would allow restrictions \non these drugs and collect rebates. At the time, it was approximately $1 million \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 11 \n \ndollars; that number has come down. Every other year they would come back \nand permanently attempt to remove those restrictions as it is being written into \nS.B. 21. We were opposed and would convince them to extend it another two \nyears.  \n \nThere is a sunset on this as of July 1, 2019. To my understanding, there are \nbudget consequences in the $600,000 range. We asked the DHHS if we could \nwork with them in the Interim to see if there was something else we could \ncome up with to address our concerns.  \n \nThe best thing that could happen for Medicaid folks with mental illness is for a \nprescription to be filled with no prior requirements. We understand that will no \nlonger happen. \n \nI have provided a flyer (Exhibit F) showing how Medicaid patients are currently \nreceiving medications. In the Fee for Service category a formulary is developed \nthrough  the  Drug  Utilization  Review  Board  (DUR)  and  Pharmacy  and \nTherapeutics (P&T) Committee which is a public process. There are limitations \nthat will be put on this public process. I have seen the DUR and P&T Committee \ntake public input and make changes based on what they intended to do.  \n \nThe Managed Care Plan category formularies are developed in private. These \nplans can be different, simple and complicated. You may have to scroll down \n30 pages to get the information on what the restrictions might be. We have \npatients that can be in one of four of these categories. We asked the DHHS \nhow we could make this easier for the patient. It should not matter which one \nof these categories you are in to know which drugs you will be able to access. \nThat is the way it is currently working. We asked the DHHS whether these \nthree  drug  classes,  atypical  and  typical  antipsychotics,  anticonvulsants  and \nantidepressants  could  be  executed  through  the  public  and  fee  for  service \nsystems carving out these three drug classes for mental health drugs.  \n \nWe appreciate that amendment 2 would include these drugs. If this cannot be \ndone, we would request these drugs get carved out as it should not matter \nwhat category you fall in. Most patients and patient advocates with mental \nhealth issues are afraid of being in the managed care system. About 70 percent \nof our patients with Medicaid are in the managed care system.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 12 \n \nI am in opposition as ideally it would be great for protected classes to go on \nindefinitely. We have not been a protected class since 2010. You can continue \nto delay this for another two years, but that is unproductive. If we could get \npast the point of continuing to delay this for another two years, we would \nsupport this bill. \n \nBETTY  VANDEUSEN  (Executive  Director,  Nevada  Chapter  of  the  National \nHemophilia Foundation): \nWe are in opposition to S.B. 283. I have submitted written testimony from the \nNational  Hemophilia  Foundation  (Exhibit  G)  and  will  read  from  my  written \ntestimony (Exhibit H). \n \nSARAH ADLER (President, National Alliance on Mental Illness Western Nevada): \nThe National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) is hopeful for the world that was \ndescribed by Senator Cancela and Ms. Slamowitz; however, at this time we are \nin opposition. We urge the Committee to ensure open access to all atypical and \ntypical  antipsychotics  and  to  continue  to  exclude  antipsychotic  medications \nfrom a list of preferred prescription drugs in the State Medicaid Program. \n \nWe are concerned S.B. 283 would remove the presently existing exclusion. We \nwould like for the sun not to set. It is incredibly difficult for severely mentally ill \npeople  to  achieve  stability.  We  are  succeeding  with  the  current  access  to \nantipsychotic medications. When individuals with mental health conditions are \nunable  to  access  the  most  appropriate  clinically  indicated  psychiatric \nmedications,  they  experience  higher  rates  of  emergency  room  visits, \nhospitalizations and other health services. \n \nA study in general hospital psychiatry by Joyce West, Ph.D., analyzed Medicaid \ndata from ten states. The study found psychiatric patients who reported access \nproblems with their medication visited the emergency department 74 percent \nmore than those who had no difficulties accessing their medications. I have \nsubmitted  a  statement  (Exhibit  I)  from  Robin  Reedy,  NAMI  State  Director, \nexplaining more on this data. \n \nCATHERINE O'MARA (Nevada State Medical Association): \nWe are neutral on the section related to the expansion of the PMP although it \ncould be a beneficial tool for physicians. We have issues where patients state \nthey are taking a blue pill and some kind of red pill, or they do not remember \nwhat their other doctor has prescribed. It would be helpful to be able to look at \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 13 \n \nthe PMP and see what medications are listed in order to help these patients. I \nhave gone through a demonstration on the PMP, and there are ways to organize \nit so you can sort by controlled and non-controlled substances and find the data \nyou need.  \n \nMy  father  is  elderly  and  has  seven  doctors.  We  keep  a  binder  of  all  his \nmedications to share with his primary care doctor when we go for visits. His \nprimary care doctor would be able to access his medication information on the \nPMP rather than us providing our binder at each visit. \n \nWe do get paranoid when we talk about the DHHS collecting and studying data. \nWe reached out to them and asked them how they would be using this data. If \nit is for studying public health, we are on board.  \n \nWe went through a controlled substance bill last Session, and we have another \none  this  Session.  We  would  oppose  any  pathway  of  mandated  prescriber \nguidelines on other drugs. We understand that is not the intent behind the bill, \nand the DHHS is not going in that direction. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI recognize this is a complicated issue and there are competing factors we are \nattempting  to  address.  This  is  a  serious  and  significant  issue.  We  want  to \nensure we have protected classes so care is not disrupted by preauthorization or \nthe need for step therapy. At the same time, it is a challenging notion that we \nwill tie the hands of our own purchasers to negotiate pricing in order to bring \ndown prices for the system. We can afford to do more for patients.  \n \nContinuing  to  sunset  is  not  good  policy  making.  We  need  to  figure  out  a \nlong-term solution to have a balanced approach to meeting the needs of the \npatients of Nevada, as well as manage costs and figure out how to solve this \npermanently. \n \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 283 and open the hearing on S.B. 387. \n \nSENATE BILL 387: Revises provisions relating to organ donation. (BDR 40-882) \n \nSENATOR BEN KIECKHEFER (Senatorial District No. 16): \nI am here to present S.B. 387 for your consideration.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 14 \n \nThis is the fourth organ donor bill I have sponsored in the Legislature. This bill \nrelates  less  to  transplant  and  more  to  donation  of  bodies  and  tissues  for \nresearch  purposes.  The  idea  is  when  individuals  decide  to  make  a  gift  of \nthemselves to further the purposes of research that the gift is honored in the \nsame way other gifts for transplant are honored.  \n \nThe amendment (Exhibit J) ensures organizations collecting donations made for \nnontransplantation  follow  certain  standards  put  forth  by  the  American \nAssociation  of  Tissue  Banks  and  the  Eye  Bank  Association  of  America  as \noutlined by regulations to be developed by the DHHS. The goal is to ensure the \norganizations in these donation processes are following high standards adopted \nand  established  at  the  national  level  and  are  encouraging  more  people  to \nparticipate in the process and donation in general. \n \nDAN MUSGROVE (Nevada Donor Network): \nNevada Donor Network supports S.B. 387. The number of people waiting for a \nlifesaving transplant today is 114,000. Another name is added to the list every \nten minutes. We have 600 Nevadans waiting for a lifesaving available organ for \ntransplantation. Sadly, we have 20 people die each day for lack of an organ \ndonation. Anything that might chill organ donation is something we want to \nwork to counteract.  \n \nIn 2015, we had a situation in Las Vegas where bodies donated by those who \nthought they were donating their loved one for research were not treated with \nthe dignity they deserved. The only thing the DHHS could do was charge the \ncompany for pollution. \n \nThis bill focuses on nontransplant body donation. The three organ procurement \norganizations in Nevada are highly regulated at the federal level. The federal \ngovernment  has  not  been  able  to  put  together  legislation  to  regulate  these \nnontransplant organizations. There is a bill in Congress that is a placeholder; \nthere is no language in the bill. We have about ten states that have begun to \nattempt  regulating  this  industry.  Nevada  could  be  one  of  the  first  to  set  a \nstandard.  \n \nSenate Bill 387 has devised a new definition for what we call nontransplant \nbody  donation  organization.  When  the  bill  was  crafted  they  brought  in \nprocurement organizations, something we do not need to do as they are now \nhighly  regulated.  We  want  to  focus  on  a  nontransplant  body  donation \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 15 \n \norganization. Those are folks engaged in the disposition of human bodies and \nhuman body parts donated or transferred for educational research or for the \nadvancement of medical, dental or mortuary science and not for use in human \ntransplantation.  \n \nWe have created a mechanism for the DHHS to regulate this, and they did make \na suggestion to ensure the actual Department of Public and Behavioral Health is \nthe one establishing the regulations. It would be the DHHS that enforces the \nregulations according to national standards and ensures these folks are treated \nwith dignity. \n \nThis is language that comes from other regulations set for regulation disregard. \nFew,  if  any,  rules  mean  there  are  few  consequences  when  bodies  are \nmistreated. We want to ensure there are consequences if our loved ones are \ntreated in an inappropriate way. \n \nWARREN HARDY (Life Science Anatomical): \nLife  Science  Anatomical  is  a  nontransplant  donor  who  follows  the  national \nstandard and is in support of S.B. 387. We are concerned there is nothing in \nState law or regulation that provides a framework for how this should be done. \nWe look forward to working with the sponsors of the bill in the regulatory \nprocess. \n \nJESSICA VELA (Community Relations Specialist, Sierra Donor Service of Nevada): \nI will read from my written testimony (Exhibit K) in support of S.B. 387. \n \nTYRE GRAY: \nAs a private citizen, I support S.B. 387. September 12, 2012, I received a \nkidney transplant that helped to save my life. I support anything that helps to \nassist and encourage people to donate. \n \nMCCLURE CRONIN (Donor Network West): \nDonor Network West supports S.B. 387. This is something that is necessary to \nprotect Nevadans. The data and information sharing provisions will be important \ngoing forward to help educate our legislators, our government and individuals \nthroughout the State.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 16 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThis is an effort to ensure nothing is on our books that allows a process that \ncreates a chilling effect on people's desire to donate and save lives. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 387 and open the hearing on S.B. 446. \n \nSENATE BILL 446: Revises provisions relating to Medicaid. (BDR 38-974) \n \nSENATOR JAMES A. SETTELMEYER (Senatorial District No. 17): \nI am here to present S.B. 446 for your consideration. This bill is a result of \nconcerns from a constituent who reached out to me. He is self-sufficient, has a \njob and would love the idea of using his own money to help supplement the \nreimbursement to caregivers. This is not allowed under current Nevada law. We \nare attempting to correct this. \n \nWe have a very successful economy in northern Nevada that has had some \nunintended consequences. Individuals with disabilities are unable to find people \nto help care for them. Medicare reimburses approximately $24 per hour, and in \nreality, the reimbursement to caregivers is about $9 per hour. At that rate, it is \ndifficult for individuals to find caregivers. \n \nThis bill seeks to create a supported  personal care concept similar to what \nKansas currently has. I was fortunate when I brought forth this language to be \ndirected to the DHHS where I worked with an individual who actually came \nfrom Kansas. She was familiar with the process but could not speak for or \nagainst, as she works for the DHHS, but she was able to  provide us with \ninformation on the subject. \n \nThe first part of the bill would allow for Medicaid individuals to directly receive \nreimbursement as they do in Kansas. That would then allow them to allocate \nthe money to individuals rather than dealing with a service contract. Under the \nsame portion of the bill it would allow them to use other sources of money \nincluding their own. It would also allow a relative of a Medicaid recipient with \nthe proper training to receive reimbursement for personal care services covered \nby Medicaid that are provided pursuant to NRS.  \n \nSection 1, subsection 3 of the bill states: \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 17 \n \nAn  agency  to  provide  personal  care  services  in  the  home  that \nenters  into  a  contract  with  Medicaid  must  agree  to  pay  its \nemployees who provide personal care services at least 75 percent \nof  the  reimbursements  paid  to  the  agency  under  Medicaid  for \npersonal care services.  \n \nIf they are paying $20 per hour, the goal would be to pay $15 per hour to the \nMedicaid recipient. This may cause concern with the service agencies and may \nneed  to  be  discussed  further.  We  are  not  attempting  to  get  rid  of  these \nagencies. We want to open up more opportunities for individuals to care for \nthemselves,  especially  those  such  as  my  constituent  who  are  more  than \nmentally capable of caring for themselves and directing some of their own care.  \n \nThis bill has the opportunity for those who are wheelchair-bound or those with \nautism  or  any  other  disability  where  there  is  an  issue  with  paying  the \nappropriate wage, to interest individuals in becoming caregivers.  \n \nTED NAGLE: \nI am 60 years old, owned a home and ran a business in Gardnerville for the past \n23 years.  The  last  ten  months  I  have  lived  at  Gardnerville  Health  and \nRehabilitation Center as I have no caregiver in my home. I was born with a birth \ndefect called arthrogryposis, which has left me needing to rely on others for my \npersonal needs such as dressing, bathing, cooking and cleaning, among other \nthings.  \n \nLife has had challenges, but I have made the best of what God has given me. I \nwas  born  in  the  San  Fernando  Valley  of  California,  the  youngest  of  eight \nchildren. I was raised to look for ways to do things rather than complaining that \nI was not able to. I was taught Christian values I hold close to my heart and to \nbe grateful for what I have, not complaining that life is unfair.  \n \nMost of my youth was spent in special schools for the disabled, as at the time \nthey were not yet mainstreaming the disabled into the regular school system. \nAfter eleventh grade, I told my parents I wanted to go to regular school for my \nsenior year or not go to school. They instilled in me the \"go get 'em\" attitude, \nand thanks to my parents' activism, I was the first wheelchair-bound student to \ngraduate  from  Chatsworth  High  School  in  Los  Angeles  County  in  1976.  I \ngraduated with a 3.5 grade point average in the top 5 percent of my class, to \ndate the largest graduating class in the Los Angeles City Schools history. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 18 \n \nBecause of my love for learning, I went on to study at five different colleges \nover the years. Though I did not receive a degree, due to the misdirection of \ncareer counselors, I excelled in several areas helping me to become the man I \nam  today.  I  continue  to  learn  new  things  daily  through  self-study  and  life \nlessons.  \n \nShortly after graduating high school, I decided it was time to move out on my \nown as my other siblings had done. Reluctantly, my parents helped me get \nsettled into an apartment, and like other kids my age, I was free. This would not \nhave been possible without caregivers and family members. The first year was \nchallenging and a bit scary, to say the least, but I did it. I am a stubborn person \nand have rarely found a challenge I could not overcome. At this point, I knew I \ncould survive the real world with the assistance of personal caregivers and help \nfrom family and friends. I have successfully integrated into society for better or \nworse. \n \nOver the 40 years of my adulthood, I have had over 150 caregivers, maybe \nmore, in California, Washington and Nevada. Each state has their pluses and \nminuses  as  far  as  personal  care  programs  are  concerned.  When  I  lived  in \nCalifornia, their program was a self-managed program allowing me to find my \nown  caregivers  who  were  paid  through  the  in-home  supportive  services \nprograms. This worked for me.  \n \nIn Washington, their program was similar in that I could recommend people to \nthe  program,  or  they  would  provide  personal  caregivers  to  you.  Whenever \npossible, I chose the caregiver myself in order to have more control over my life. \nDuring  the  four-and-a-half  year  period  I  was  in  Washington,  I  had  four \ncaregivers, one of who was a relative, which is not allowed in Nevada.  \n \nSince I moved to Nevada in 1996, I have been amazed by how convoluted the \npersonal care programs are and how difficult it is to understand the programs. It \nis almost impossible to get the information for the programs. The counselors \nand their supervisors seem to know only what is deemed necessary to run their \nportion of the program. It seems like a guessing game to me, or they are trained \nto avoid certain aspects of the program.  \n \nLiving in rural Nevada, which I and many disabled Nevadans choose to do, is a \nbig problem as the workforce is small. Finding agencies who have caregivers \nliving in the area and who accept Medicaid is difficult at best. Many agencies \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 19 \n \nhave  stopped  accepting  Medicaid  clients  because  of  reimbursement  issues. \nWhen an agency's only office is in an urban area, they put very little effort into \nhiring in the rural areas. It is difficult to get their existing caregivers to drive to \ndistant clients like myself for a two or three hour shift and for the pay they \nreceive, which does not include mileage or travel time pay. When they do find a \ncaregiver willing to travel the extra distance, it is short-lived.  \n \nWhat options are there? Many do not know there is a fund available to pay for \nmileage to and from distant clients such as myself. Why has it taken 20 years \nof living in rural Nevada to find out about this? I have tried, and it seems to be a \nvery well-kept secret.  \n \nOver the years, I have had caregivers lasting two to three years. I have others \nwho have lasted two or three days with an average longevity of two months. I \nwas married ten years ago and the constant change of people coming and going \nhas been a challenge. Because my wife cannot physically take care of me due \nto her own physical limitations, the need for personal caregivers is less desirable \nbut more necessary. At one point, my week was made up of seven different \ncaregivers just to be able to cover the day. There is no stability in that.  \n \nThere  are  several  problems  arising  from  the  current  Medicaid  funded  care \nprogram in Nevada. When you pay someone the same starting wage or less \nthan those of fast-food companies, and the duties are less desirable, people are \nnot going to stay. People living on such menial wages are more likely to steal \nfrom  the  people  they  are  caring  for  to  supplement  their  wages.  This  has \nhappened  to  me  to  the  tune  of  over  $10,000  in  personal  property  and \nmedications. This has happened to almost every disabled person I know. It is \nhard to trust people, and that is a shame.  \n \nWhen a loved one needs care, and you are the only one willing to take that on, \nyou quit your job and do the honorable thing. Then you find out a spouse \ncannot  be  paid  to  care  for  the  loved  one.  This  causes  the  family  financial \ndespair, and many lose their homes because of it.  \n \nGood caregivers come and go quickly because private pay clients pay $20 to \n$25 per hour for the same services agencies are paying $10 to $12 an hour. \nWhen Medicaid recipients, their friends, relatives, churches or strangers want to \nhelp supplement the pay of caregivers to make the job more desirable, the law \ntakes the Medicaid coverage away.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 20 \n \nToday, to alleviate some of the problems caused by the low-paying Medicaid \ncontracted care agencies, S.B. 446 allows Medicaid recipients to be reimbursed \nfor personal care services paid for by my own means or by the means of other \nindividuals. This bill also allows Medicaid recipients to pay, by their own means \nor the means of others, supplemental pay for caregivers without affecting their \nMedicaid eligibility. The bill will not limit relatives from being caregivers and \nbeing  paid  for  the  services.  It  will  require  care  agencies  to  pay  at  least \n75 percent of the monies reimbursed by Medicaid to the individual caregivers \nwho are providing the care. \n \nDoes this solve all of the problems? No, but it is a good beginning, and Medicaid \nrecipients  will  have  options  to  hopefully  find  and  keep  quality,  reliable \ncaregivers.  \n \nSENATOR JOSEPH P. HARDY (Senatorial District No. 12): \nWhen people enter the prison system, they have their Medicaid terminated at a \ncritical time in their life when attempting to overcome addictions or work on \nsubstance  abuse.  It  is  then  reinstated  when  they  are  released,  which  is  a \nprocess.  The  suspension  of  Medicaid  is  easier  to  do  than  terminating  the \ncoverage. That is the genesis of the idea around the amendment to S.B. 446 \nclarifying the bill itself.  \n \nThe conceptual amendment (Exhibit L) explains the revisions to be made to \nS.B. 446. \n \nWe will be able to save lives as soon as people are released from incarceration \nas they go back to the same dose they used prior to incarceration and overdose. \nWe have hope we can help people and save their livelihood. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe  have  two  distinct  concepts  brought  to  us  today.  The  ability  to  ensure \npersonal care assistance where needed and making sure we have continuity of \ncare for individuals who are departing jail or the prison system. \n \nERIC SPRATLEY (Executive Director, Nevada Sheriffs' and Chiefs' Association): \nNevada Sheriffs' and Chiefs' Association supports S.B. 446. We, along with the \nWashoe County Sheriffs' Office and stakeholders, have been a part of several \nmeetings on the incarceration part of this bill. We are at a place where the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 21 \n \nmechanics of the bill seem to be doable for the Sheriffs and the jails, and we \nlook forward to the implementation in the future. \n \nJOELLE GUTMAN (Washoe County Health District): \nThe  Washoe  County  Health  District  Supports  S.B.  446  specifically  for  the \nsuspension versus termination piece in the conceptual amendment. We provide \nfamily planning services and sexually transmitted disease testing to the Washoe \nCounty Sheriffs' Office. As we have a captive audience, we can encourage \nthem  to  access  additional  resources  on  release;  however,  a  lot  of  those \nresources are dependent on being signed up for entitlement programs. By having \nMedicaid reinstated, it eliminates barriers to access and will help some of our \ncommunities'  most  vulnerable  stay  covered.  Staying  covered  means  staying \nmedicated if necessary. It also keeps people out of unnecessary hospital visits \nand hopefully the prevention of reoffending.  \n \nA.J. DELAP (Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department): \nThe Las  Vegas Metropolitan  Police Department  supports  S.B.  446. It is my \nunderstanding our Information Technology (IT) Department believes it can be \naccomplished given the time provided by the measure. We think this will be \nfruitful for our inmates as they are released back into the community. \n \nCONNIE MCMULLEN (Personal Care Association of Nevada): \nThe Personal Care Association of Nevada opposes S.B. 446. I will read from my \nwritten testimony (Exhibit M).  \n \nMr. Nagle is one of the best concepts of what the Olmstead Decision stood for \nin 1999. Keeping people who are physically disabled in the least restrictive \nsetting in a place they make home, of their own choice, not in a nursing home. I \ncommend  him  for  his  lifelong  effort  in  doing  so.  I  recently  served  as  an \nOlmstead Co-chair to update their annual report, so I understand his dilemma. I \nalso think his efforts to find caregivers and the rate at which Medicaid pays \npoints to the problems we have been talking about for the past two Sessions.  \n \nThe underlying concern is in trying to better serve the clients in rural Nevada. \nCasual caregivers, a neighbor, a relative, a sister or brother is where Medicaid \nclients  are  going  to  be  forced  to  go.  This  is  not  a  good  incentive  for \nprofessionals to service the rural communities. It will be a disincentive.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 22 \n \nSTEVE  FISHER  (Administrator,  Division  of  Welfare  and  Supportive  Services, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nThe suspension of the Medicaid portion of the bill is very important, and the \nDivision of Welfare and Supportive Services is always looking for ways to make \nour process more efficient. We currently have eligibility workers in both the \nClark and Washoe County Detention Centers doing eligibility as individuals are \nleaving these facilities. However, electronically doing this would be the next \nstep as suspending eligibility would be more efficient. The piece that is missing \nfor  stakeholders  and  detention  centers  is  knowing  when  someone  enters  a \nfacility and when they are leaving. If we can electronically get this information, \nwe can suspend and then reinstate their eligibility more efficiently. The Division \nsupports S.B. 446. \n \nDUANE  YOUNG  (Deputy  Administrator,  Division  of  Health  Care  Financing  and \nPolicy, Department of Health and Human Services): \nWe  wanted  to  speak  to  the  self-directed  piece  referred  to  today.  This  is  a \n1915(j) Self-Directed Personal Assistance Services State Plan option that can be \noperated under the 1915(c) Home and Community-Based Services Waiver that \nserves the physically disabled population. This would look at our highest acuity \nclients within this waiver allowing them to work through a self-directed model \nreferenced here many times.  \n \nThis is something the DHCFP has looked at over the years and were hoping to \nlook at and implement in future sessions. We have placed a moderate fiscal note \non  this.  The  cost  would  be  in  terms  of  staffing  and  the  different  pieces \nMs. McMullen  referred  to  is  the  administrative  cost.  That  is  taken  care  of \nthrough a program called Cash and Counseling. Agencies are paid a capitated \nrate  per  member  per  month  for  those  in  the  program  to  oversee  the \nadministrative  functions,  and  the  rest  goes  to  the  person  performing  the \nservices.  \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nDo you feel you could have done this through the regulatory process before \nneeding any kind of legislation, or was this bill presenting the legislation to do \nsomething like this? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nIt requires budget authority which we have not had to implement a program like \nthis with competing priorities. With this legislation, the opportunity to place a \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 23 \n \nfiscal note on this portion of the bill is the opportunity to possibly see this come \nto fruition for Nevada. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe have a self-directed care model, or are moving toward a self-directed care \nmodel and not the 1915(j) waiver, but the Intermediary Service Organization \n(ISO) programs. Who can speak to what an ISO program is accomplishing now, \nand how it would differ from what we are currently doing with what the 1915(j) \nwaiver might accomplish? \n \nKIRSTEN  COULOMBE  (Social  Services  Chief,  Long  Term  Services  and  Support, \nDivision of Health Care Financing and Policy, Department of Health and \nHuman Services): \nAs an option to receive personal care services through Nevada Medicaid, we \ncurrently can receive services through a traditional agency model. We also have \nan  ISO  model  where  we  have  a  fiscal  agent  who  receives  the  funds,  bills \nMedicaid and ensures all of the necessary requirements are completed, such as \ntuberculosis (TB) testing and training requirements.  \n \nThe difference with the 1915(j) model is the recipient manages the self-direction \nthey are responsible for and their budget which is different than what they have \nin  the  self-directed  program.  Right  now,  the  self-directed  program  is  more \nrelated to the components of meeting work requirements, and recipients do not \nmanage budgets. It is not a Cash and Counseling Program which is within the \nDHCFP,  and  it  is  not  currently  within  the  Division  of  Public  and  Behavioral \nHealth.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIf Mr. Nagle, or anyone similarly situated, came to an ISO today and stated they \nhad a friend who would be a great caregiver and would like her to be their \ncaregiver, what would happen? \n \nMS. COULOMBE: \nThey would first have an assessment for personal care services to see how \nmany hours they would need authorized for those services. They would then tell \nthe ISO entity this would be the caregiver they choose to perform services. \nThey can have family caregivers who do not have a legal relationship with the \nMedicaid recipient. By terms of legal relationship it means it could not be a \nspouse or someone who has a legal guardianship over the patient. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 24 \n \nWe do have family members who provide personal care services, particularly in \nthe rural areas where we do not have a lot of agencies. That is an option as \nlong as there is no legal relationship. The ISO holds the licensure, oversees the \ntime sheets and would currently work to ensure the TB testing and training \nrequirements have been completed. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDo they pay the caregivers? \n \nMS. COULOMBE: \nThere is an administrative fee that is from our current Medicaid rate of $17 an \nhour for personal care services. They have administrative fees, and they would \npay the caregiver. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDoes the larger portion of the Medicaid rate of $17 an hour end up in the hands \nof the caregiver in an ISO? \n \nMS. COULOMBE: \nNo, not through the ISO, but through the 1915(j) State Plan option. It is a Cash \nand Counseling program, so the recipient would manage that with a budget they \ncould use. We do not currently have a 1915(j) State Plan in Nevada; we are still \nlearning what those options are. They would be able to purchase services and \ngoods with a lot more flexibility than we would have in the ISO option. \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nThe  State  would  pay  the  administrative  fees  through  the  capitated  rate  to \noversee the Cash and Counseling portion. That would be the difference in the \nmodels as more would be passed on through the 1915(j) State Plan. There \nwould not be an agency taking their fees off the top before giving pay to the \ncaregiver.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIf we were to pursue the 1915(j) waiver, it would take out the middle man of \nthe ISO and get more money directly to the caregiver? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nIt  allows  the  State  a  process  to  pay  for  the  management  outside  of  the \nacceptable rate. The State would be paying for the administrative costs outside \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 25 \n \nof that through the capitation fee, and the rate would be passed on to the \ncaregiver.  \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nMr. Nagle mentioned he would like to be able to supplement the caregiver under \nany one of these two programs mentioned. Does that allow for a participant to \nsupplement a caregiver in order to incentivize others to be caregivers? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nNevada Medicaid Services Manual Chapter 100 outlines that Medicaid payment \nmust be accepted in full for all providers. There is no way to supplement any \npayment for any Medicaid services. States that do this usually operate within a \nwaiver in which they have copays. Nevada does not do this. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nPlease explain the co-pay piece. \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nThere are states that have \"skin in the game\". They will charge recipients $1 to \n$2 dollars per Medicaid service. Most states have done this to ensure their \nattendance  rates  at  appointments.  Nevada  Medicaid  does  not  do  this.  It  is \noutlined in our policy and in our State Plan that all Medicaid payments are \naccepted as final; no provider can charge any fees to a Medicaid recipient. Even \nif the Medicaid recipient was voluntarily paying it would still be considered a \nprovider accepting fees from the recipient. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIn Nevada, we prohibit any co-pay, and we are doing that because we are \nrequired to by the federal government, as we do not have a waiver to do it \ndifferently? Even if we change that in NRS? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nThat is correct. We would have to apply for a waiver to do that. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWould that waiver we apply for require them to charge a co-pay for Medicaid \nservices? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 26 \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nIt  would  depend  on  the  design  of  the  waiver.  I  can  get  you  the  correct \ninformation, but I believe it would be a Section 1115 demonstration waiver. We \nwould have some flexibility in designing the waiver in terms of services that \nwould and would not allow co-pays.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSo we are now up to two waivers and need to apply for a third? Is the legal \nrelationship also something we are not allowed to change? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nIt can be a family member who is not a legal guardian. It is difficult for a spouse \nor a parent as I believe they would have to give power of attorney to another \nindividual. If there was another family member who was not legally responsible, \nthey can currently serve as a caregiver through the ISO model. They would be \nallowed to do that through the 1915(j) waiver as well. \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nWould that individual be paid as well? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nThat is correct for both the ISO and 1915(j) waiver programs. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nWho sets the rate, or is this something the agency working with the individual \nsets? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nWe currently set the rate which is $4.28 per 15 minute increment. We have a \nbudget proposal to raise that rate this year within the Governor's recommended \nbudget.  We  are  proposing  $17.56  per  hour  which  would  be  $4.39  per \n15 minute  increment.  That  is  set  through  Medicaid  and  approved  by  this \nCommittee. Medicaid, as with any rate, is not able to regulate or recommend \nwhat is passed on to the caregiver performing the services under the agencies \napplying for the rate. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nIt would be set by the agency who provides the frontline worker? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 27 \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nThe  actual  Medicaid  rate  is  set  by  Medicaid.  The  rate  that  is  paid  to  the \ncaregiver would be set by the agency, and Medicaid has no part in that.  \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nMr. Nagle stated there were, at one time, seven caregivers within seven days at \nhis  home.  We  have  a  difficult  time  getting  caregivers  to  the  rural  areas  of \nNevada. If we do not pass this bill, how easy or difficult would it be to ensure \nthose like Mr. Nagle are serviced in a quality and consistent way? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nWe  have  always  had  challenges  recruiting  personal  care  agencies  and \nparticipation  in  personal  care  agencies  particularly  in  the  northern  and  rural \nareas. With our health care shortage, this will always be a challenge. Part of the \nreason in proposing the higher rate was to address this challenge. If there is \nmore passed on to the agency there will be more passed on to the caregiver.  \n \nThe option of family members and legally responsible adults is always going to \nbe an issue. There are family members currently serving in the ISO. If that is a \ncommunication issue, this is something we can help to spread the word that \nthey would be able to work within the existing models. If we explored the \n1915(j) State Plan option, this would also help get the word out that family \nmembers would be able to serve as caregivers. \n \nI believe the issue of recruitments would remain the same. \n \nDENA  SCHMIDT  (Administrator,  Division  of  Aging  and  Disability  Services, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nOur  Division  does  some  of  the  assessments  for  the  individuals  on  the  frail \nelderly and physically disabled waiver. We refer the individual caregiver and \nassist with getting them enrolled with an ISO.  \n \nThis is a State Plan option within our waiver. This would be a voluntary option \nfor those folks on the frail elderly and physically disabled program. This would \nnot replace the ISO. It would give the State an additional option for certain \nindividuals to meet their needs. It provides some flexibility in areas we do not \ncurrently have it. It is not a mandate for the individual or the State agency. \nBecause it is an option, we have flexibility in the way it is designed and who \ncan qualify for this model. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 28 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nCan anyone speak to the question regarding mileage or travel time pay? \n \nMS. COULOMBE: \nNevada Medicaid does not currently cover or budget for mileage reimbursement \nfor personal care services, but we are happy to look into this as a standard or \nbest practice in other states. \n \nSENATOR SETTELMEYER: \nWhen we started looking at this issue, somehow none of these discussions \ncame forward. I encourage everyone who states there is an option available, to \nspeak to my constituents so we can exercise these options. We are frustrated \nas to why we have not applied for additional waivers when it appears they are \nwhat we need. \n \nI  support  Senator  Hardy's  amendment  to  the  bill.  We  need  to  get  the \nreimbursement rates at a fair level. If it is not prohibited, we should pass this bill \nas it provides more options. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThis is something we need to provide more time and energy to. There are some \nthings we can do legally and those we cannot. I would encourage working with \nDHHS to see what can be done before it goes to the Finance Committee as they \nwill  have  questions.  This  Body  has  yet  to  authorize  the  budget  allocation \nnecessary to get the waiver completed.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY:  \nRealistically, this has been a great opportunity to shed light on things that need \nto be done that are beneficial for all people. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 446 and open the work session on S.B. 262. \n \nSENATE BILL 262: Makes various changes to provide for tracking and reporting \nof information concerning the pricing of prescription drugs for treating \nasthma.

This bill requires Medicaid \nto  cover  services  provided  by  chiropractors.  I  have  submitted  a  conceptual \namendment (Exhibit S) which deletes section 2 of the bill, meaning section 1 is \nthe only substantive section of the bill. It specifically requires the Director of the \nDHHS  to  include,  in  the  State  Plan  for  Medicaid,  a  provision  authorizing \nreimbursement under Medicaid for the services of a chiropractor.  \n \nThe fiscal note submitted by the DHCFP is not as large as some of the other \nbills  requiring  Medicaid  to  cover  certain  services.  This  is,  in  part,  because \nMedicaid  currently  covers  chiropractic  services  for  children.  This  bill  would \nsimply apply that for adults as well. \n \nMARLENE LOCKARD (Nevada Chiropractic Association): \nDr. Robert Rosenbaum recently stated and the Nevada Chiropractic Association \nagrees  health  care  is  today's  front  page  news.  It  is  hotly  debated  in \nWashington, D.C. and here at the Legislature.  \n \nWhether you are a patient, family member, provider, administrator or payer you \ncare about how this problem is managed. In an age of increasing specialization, \ndecreasing availability of primary care providers and increasing bureaucracy in \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 33 \n \naccessing care, patients need to interact with care providers who can assess \nand treat their problems.  \n \nPeople  on  Medicaid  in  30  states  and  everyone  on  Medicare  can  access \nchiropractors  for  various  chronic  pain  and  disability.  Missouri  was  the  most \nrecent state to pass this measure. The Director of Missouri's Department of \nHealth and Senior Services recognizes that:  \n \nThe importance of alternative therapies in the treatment of chronic \npain is a major milestone in our response to preventing substance \nuse disorder which often begins with prescription medications and \nself-medication for pain management. \n \nWhen Ohio introduced their bill, representative Scott Lipps stated, \"Chiropractic \ncare  is  widely  recognized  as  one  of  the  safest,  drug  free,  noninvasive \ntreatments for conditions such as back and neck pain.\" \n \nChiropractic methods can solve the root cause of pain instead of masking the \npain and risking dependency on opioids. Research has found prescription opioid \npain medications are ineffective in the treatment of chronic lower back pain. \nThe National Institutes of Health performed a study that found complimentary \npain management approaches such as yoga, massage and chiropractic medicine \nwere helpful in managing chronic pain for some patients. Diversifying the kinds \nof care patients can receive to manage their health is not just good for public \nhealth, it is fiscally responsible. \n \nAccording  to  the  Office  of  the  Inspector  General,  chiropractic  care  only \ncomprises a small portion of total State Medicare expenditures. A professor at \nSaint  Louis  University,  Dr.  John  McGowan,  crunched  numbers  and  found \nchiropractic  care  can  reduce  the  total  costs  of  health  care  spending  by \nsubstituting invasive medical and pharmaceutical care with less invasive and \nless expensive chiropractic care. He estimated the State of Missouri would save \nbetween $9.8 million and $21 million by allowing Medicaid patients to access \nchiropractic care in lieu of other more expensive options. \n \nChiropractic care is an important option that should be available to Nevadans on \nMedicaid. Please vote to ensure patients have diverse and robust alternative \ntherapies for their chronic pain.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 34 \n \nDAVID  ROVETTI,  D.C.  (Northern  Nevada  Director,  Nevada  Chiropractic \nAssociation): \nI am a chiropractor in northwest Reno and the northern Nevada Director for the \nNevada Chiropractic Association. On the surface, S.B. 484 may appear to give \nMedicaid recipients the luxury treatment of chiropractic care for neck and back \npain and possibly expensive care. However, there are many offsets the State \nand federal government would benefit from including it as a benefit for Medicaid \npatients. \n \nThe primary physicians who actually accept Medicaid are few and far between. \nGoing  to  a  chiropractor  would  decrease  the  amount  of  trips  to  a  primary \nphysician's office, the emergency room and associated costs for both. It would \ndecrease the chances for spinal surgery as well, which is between $15,000 and \n$30,000. Eliminating one or two percent of those surgeries through allowing \nchiropractic care would pay for the visits to the chiropractor.  \n \nThere should be an alternative to medication choices. Chiropractic care for neck \nand back pain would be an excellent alternative to medications.  \n \nThe  study  done  by  Dr.  John  McGowan  was  the  cost  efficiency  and \neffectiveness  of  including  doctors  of  chiropractic  to  offer  treatment  under \nMissouri  Medicaid.  His  conclusion  was  by  these  offsetting  factors,  Missouri \nwould save $9.8 to $21 million. Our population is half that of Missouri, so we \nwould also expect to save that amount.  \n \nWith chiropractic care, the fact that we actually touch the patient and we have \ntime  to  listen  to  the  patient  creates  a  good  rapport  with  the  patient  and \nincreases their satisfaction. As a parent with a child with a disability, who will \nprobably be into the Medicaid system at one point, it would be nice to know he \nwill be given the opportunity to choose his provider and have increased patient \nsatisfaction.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWas  the  study  by  Dr.  McGowan  projecting  what  would  be  saved  or  what \nactually was saved?  \n \nMR. ROVETTI: \nIt was a projected study done about a year ago. I do not have data on what \nactually happened once it was put into law. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 35 \n \nMS. LOCKARD: \nThe law in Missouri was just adopted last week. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nAre there any other states where this is a law? \n \nMS. LOCKARD: \nOhio has also introduced legislation. There are currently 30 additional entities; I \ncan provide a list of those states for you. \n \nCYRUS HOJJATY: \nI support S.B. 484. \n \nSUZANNE BIERMAN (Administrator, Division of Health Care Financing and Policy, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nIt  was  mentioned  that  Nevada  Medicaid  currently  covers  the  services  for \nchildren  and  qualified  Medicare  beneficiaries.  This  bill  revolves  around  the \naddition of the adult population.  \n \nWe have been working with the Nevada Chiropractic Association to explore \nwhether there are cost savings, or if this would be cost neutral. We believe \nexpanding these services could lead to reductions in other areas of Medicaid \nsuch as emergency room use. We are committed to continuing to work with the \nAssociation and others to explore those options. This is also something we \ncould do in the absence of legislation. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAre you are saying we could add chiropractic services to the Medicaid State \nPlan should this bill not pass? \n \nMS. BIERMAN: \nThat is correct. We do not need specific legislation to necessarily add services if \nwe  can  demonstrate  it  would  be  cost  neutral  or  result  in  a  savings  to  the \nMedicaid program. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWould that be done as part of the State Plan update? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 36 \n \nMS. BIERMAN: \nCorrect. We would have to provide information on reimbursement rates and \nensure it was meeting cost neutral or cost savings purposes as we do not have \na decision unit in the current budget for the addition of these services. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 484 and open the hearing on S.B. 472. \n \nSENATE  BILL  472:  Establishes  a  database  of  information  concerning  health \ninsurance claims in this State. (BDR 40-1145) \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI am here to present S.B. 472 for your consideration. This bill establishes an \nall-payer claims database (APCD) system in Nevada. The measure makes strides \ntoward our goal of healthier, more informed Nevadans. It provides the means for \nhow we can receive better health care with smarter spending.  \n \nOver the past several years, a growing number of states have established a \nstate sponsored APCD system to address the needs of transparency in health \ncare at the state level and support consumers, purchasers and state reform \nefforts. \n \nAn APCD is a large-scale state database that systematically collects medical, \npharmacy and dental claims. The purpose of the APCD system is to inform \nconsumers  and  purchasers  about  cost  containment  and  quality  improvement \nefforts. The database contains eligibility and claims data and is used to report \ncost, use and quality information.  \n \nThe data consists of service level information based on valid claims processed \nby health payers. Service level information includes charges, payments, clinical \ndiagnoses  and  procedures  codes  and  patient  demographics.  To  mask  the \nidentity of the patients and ensure privacy, data is encrypted and aggregated \nand patient identifiers are suppressed. \n \nThe first statewide APCD system was established in Maine in 2003. Today, \nthere are 26 states with an APCD system, and other states have introduced \nlegislation with such a system.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 37 \n \nI would like to present examples of ways an APCD system is used to promote \ntransparency  and  oversight  in  health  care  utilization,  quality,  and  cost. \nPromoting cost and quality transparency and protecting consumers, the APCD \ncost website in New Hampshire, Maine and Maryland makes available provider \nlevel  price  and  quality  information  to  consumers,  health  plan  enrollees  and \nemployers to promote health care comparison shopping. \n \nThe Oregon APCD publishes quarterly reports that compare per member per \nmonth cost and utilization services by category for commercially insured, public \nemployees and public payers. In Colorado, the information has been analyzed to \nstudy price variation for common procedures among health care facilities.  \n \nThe system in Massachusetts has been used to produce an annual report of \ntrends in health care spending for commercial payers by category of service, \ntype of episode and geographic area.  \n \nRhode  Island  has  released  a  report  of  the  top  15  clinical  complaints  and \nassociated costs of potentially avoidable emergency room visits broken down by \npayer type. In Minnesota, APCD data has been used to analyze prescription drug \nspending by therapeutic category and setting. They have also released a report \nestimating the use and cost of low-value services in the state.  \n \nOrganizations  in  Virginia  and  Utah  have  used  APCD  data  to  track  opioid \nprescription  claims  across  geographic  areas  and  patient  characteristics  to \nunderstand and address trends. The researchers at Arkansas Center for Health \nImprovement  are  using  APCD  data  to  understand  the  impact  of  Medicaid \nexpansion efforts.  \n \nThe  important  point  to  remember  is  that  none  of  these  reports  would  be \npossible without an APCD system.  \n \nThe first seven sections of S.B. 472 provide definitions of terms used in the \nmeasure.  \n \nSection 8 of the bill requires the DHHS to establish an APCD of information \nrelating  to  health  insurance  claims  resulting  from  medical,  dental  or \npharmaceutical benefits provided in the State. In establishing the APCD system, \nthe measure requires the DHHS to establish a secure process for uploading the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 38 \n \ndata and ensuring the accuracy and consistency of the records. In addition, the \ndata must not contain any patient identifiers.  \n \nIn order for the DHHS to carry out the provisions of the bill, section 8 also \nauthorizes  the  establishment  of  an  advisory  committee  to  consider  the \nmaintenance and release of data. The membership of any such committee must \ninclude  representatives  of  providers  of  health  care,  health  facilities,  health \nauthorities,  health  maintenance  organizations,  private  insurers,  nonprofit \norganizations that represent consumers of health care services and each of the \ntwo entities that submit data concerning the largest number of claims to the \ndatabase. \n \nSection 9 of the bill requires any public or private insurer that provides health \nbenefits  and  is  regulated  under  State  law  to  submit  data  to  the  database. \nCertain insurers regulated under federal law are not required to submit data to \nthe database; however, they are authorized to do so.  \n \nSections 10 and 17 of the bill provide the confidentiality of the data contained \nin  the  APCD  system.  The  APCD  system  will  be  compiled  using  the  HIPAA \nrequirements currently in effect. \n \nSection 11 requires a person or entity wishing to obtain data from the APCD to \nsubmit requests to the DHHS. The request must include certain information \nincluding a description of the proposed use of the data, the measures to be \ntaken to ensure the security of the data and the method by which the data will \nbe stored. \n \nSection 12 provides for conditions under which data may be released by the \nDHHS. The conditions differ depending on the sensitivity of the information \nrequested. This section also provides for the payment of a fee for receipt of the \ninformation.  \n \nSection 13 relates to reporting requirements. The DHHS is required to publish a \nreport at least annually, concerning the quality, efficiency and cost of health \ncare in Nevada using data from the APCD system. They are also required to \npost on the internet an annual list of reports that are intended to be published \nwith data from the APCD system.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 39 \n \nSections 14 and 18 of S.B. 472 require the DHHS to submit certain reports to \nthe  Legislature  and  Interim  Finance  Committee  concerning  the  cost, \nperformance and effectiveness of the APCD system. \n \nSection 15 provides legal protections. \n \nSection 16 requires the DHHS to adopt regulations to carry out the provisions of \nthis program, including those relating to data to be included in the system, fees \nfor obtaining data and accessed penalties. \n \nSection 20 provides the provisions relating to implementing the APCD system \nare effective on January 1, 2020.  \n \nThis came to me quite by surprise, when I had a meeting with the Vice Chair of \nWestrends  for  the  Council  of  State  Governments.  We  were  attempting  to \ndiscover what we needed to do for the western region in terms of some of the \nissues we were grappling with. We came to the conclusion that health care is \none of the biggest issues each of our legislatures are wrestling with. \n \nWashington  Senator  Randi  Becker  stated  they  instituted  this  in  2014  under \nGovernor Jay Inslee. They have seen a lot of success since then.  \n \nJULIA  PEEK  (Deputy  Director,  Programs,  Department  of  Health  and  Human \nServices): \nThe DHHS has prepared a PowerPoint (Exhibit T) which I will present for you. \n \nAs part of the bill, and a national lawsuit, the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act plans do not have to report to the all-claims payer database. We \nhave spoken to a few of them, and they are willing to possibly take part in the \nprogram. This bill is a great compliment to other bills we have heard with regard \nto transparency, cost, access and utilization. \n \nThis data would allow the DHHS is to look at a number of thing, including the \ntype of patient by demographics and the geographic location of not only where \nthey live but where they are accessing services. It also includes the types of \ndiagnoses they have, medical needs and different payers. We would also be \nable  to  assess  public  health  trends.  Proprietary  data  would  not  be  shared \npublicly. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 40 \n \nThe  graph  on  page  3  of  Exhibit  T  shows  the  states  that  have  already \nimplemented databases or are in the process of implementation.  \n \nPage 4 of Exhibit T refers to the many use cases specifically for the DHHS. We \nare excited about being able to look at population health in a number of different \nways we have not been able to in the past. One of the proxies we use to \nunderstand  population  health  is  the  hospital  discharge  billing  data,  which  is \nlimited. This would expand to primary care and other types of services we do \nnot have a grasp on yet. It would also provide the opportunity to look at how \nMedicaid compares to private payers, both related to access and payment.  \n \nThe graph on page 5 of Exhibit T shows what Arkansas accomplished. They \nlooked at the Medicaid average price for certain services versus a private payer \nprice. This is good information for us to understand health care costs. If there is \na large discrepancy in that and/or trends over time, we will be able to dig deeper \nto see what is taking place. \n \nSome of the APCD successes were covered by Senator Spearman. Page 6 of \nExhibit T looks at avoidable emergency room visits by payer type. Page 7 is a \ngreat example of how states have used the data system complementing their \nefforts in looking at prescription information.  \n \nOne  of  the  challenges  in  the  State  related  to  public  health  data  is  chronic \ndisease data. It is not a public reportable condition. This would allow us, as they \ndid in Colorado, to really dive into this. We can also look at the diagnoses and \nthe types of services the patients are receiving. This is a longitudinal data set, \nso we can look over time at certain services and outcomes that we have data \non public health from birth to death.  \n \nI understand this is a Policy Committee, but I want to talk about the investment \nand our fiscal note. States have used a variety of ways to pay for the APCD \nsystem. Medicaid's proposal for Nevada would be to do this with a Medicaid \nmatch combined with the General Fund appropriation. One of the benefits we \nhave available to us now is the HITECH Act at the federal level which allows a \n90/10 match with the federal government for different IT based systems. That \nmatch does end on September 30, 2021. If we were to lose the opportunity in \nthis Session there may not be an opportunity to have it in the future. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 41 \n \nWe  also  have  the  option  to  have  ongoing  maintenance  support  at  the \n75/25 match. The State investment for this is not huge. The federal government \ndoes match a good portion of the investment.  \n \nWe have spoken with other states about what the fiscal impact might look like. \nWe feel this is the best estimate of what it could look like. Several other states \nhave talked about the wealth of data that is available and with that the data \nrequests and research that can be done. We have indicated the level of staffing \nwe believe would be needed to pull those reports and keep the data accurate \nand also work on compliance with the reporting facilities. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nSenator  Becker  said  one  of  the  greatest  benefits  has  been  to  consumers. \nWhenever they do the enrollment period, most people have no idea which plan \nwill work best for them, especially those at the senior level who have chronic \nand complicated illnesses. This will allow them to look at the plans, see who is \noffering what, and compare them side by side. This also helps lead to better \nhealth outcomes. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nDoes this take the fiscal note from $6 million to $600,000? \n \nMS. PEEK: \nWe have provided both the federal match and the State match in the proposal. \nYes, the General Fund matches that lower amount. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAre we charging a fee? I am trying to figure out where the two-thirds vote \ncomes from. \n \nERIC ROBBINS (Committee Counsel): \nI believe the bill provides for a fee for those who wish to obtain information \nfrom the database. That is where the two-thirds vote comes in. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDo  we  know  who  in  other  states  is  requesting  any  information  from  the \ndatabase? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 42 \n \nMS. PEEK: \nIt is not uncommon for us to charge a fee. We charge a fee for some of our \nother databases such as the cancer registry. Typically, it will be researchers in \nan academic setting who want to do research and publish on a topic. We will \ncharge for our time to do a review if it will be a complex, time intensive review. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThere may be some cost in terms of the time they have to put into it to submit \nthe data. We do not charge insurance plans or anyone providing data to help \nfund the project? \n \nMS. PEEK: \nThat is a model some states have used where they provide the match through a \nfee from the providers. That is not what Nevada will do; we propose the use of \nthe General Fund as the match. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI looked at the Medicaid reimbursement and thought this may backfire on us as \nno one can make a living doing that. I may be discouraging people from taking \nMedicaid. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThe upside to that would be if there are cost savings in other places to let us \nknow where we can use those cost savings. Last Session we talked about \ngathering  information  on  insulin.  If  we  gather  this  demographically  and \ngeographically, we would typically know where those types of diseases are \nprevalent. We would also be able to gather additional information to determine \nwhether there are social factors creating more of a problem or lessening the \nchronicity of those illnesses. \n \nDAMON  HAYCOCK  (Executive  Officer,  Nevada  Public  Employees  Benefits \nProgram): \nThe Public Employees' Benefits Program (PEBP) is neutral because of the slight \ncost associated with us providing these payer claims to the DHHS. This is an \nexcellent opportunity for people to obtain good data.  \n \nI would like to see what people are paying in other health care plans to help me \nnegotiate  the  lower  cost  for  our  program  and  to  the  State.  As  with  any \ninformation technology requirement, there is a pitching and catching of the data \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 43 \n \nand formatting that may need to occur, and that formatting comes at a cost. \nThis  is  not  a  cost  we  would  bare  individually  at  the  PEBP  program.  Our \nthird-party administrators would have to program it to ensure it would go over in \na format that can be absorbed by the payer database. I would think all other \nplans would have to do something similar, so it would be a potential, additional \ncost. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 472. \n \nI will entertain a motion on S.B. 484. \n \nSENATOR  HAMMOND  MOVED  TO  AMEND  AND  DO  PASS  AS \nAMENDED S.B. 484. \n \n  SENATOR HARDY SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe have received testimony in support of S.B. 387 from the Nevada Donor \nNetwork (Exhibit U) and Nevadans for the Common Good (Exhibit V). \n \nWe  have  received  testimony  in  opposition  to  S.B. 283  from  Sunovian \n(Exhibit W),  the  Epilepsy  Foundation  (Exhibit  X)  and  the  Biotechnology \nInnovation Organization (Exhibit Y). \n \nWe have received testimony in the neutral position to S.B. 283 from Gilead \n(Exhibit Z and Exhibit AA). \n   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 44 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSeeing no further business, we are adjourned at 7:11 p.m. \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nVickie Polzien, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 10, 2019 \nPage 45 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nExhibit / \nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \n# of pages \n  A  2    Agenda \n  B  8    Attendance Roster \nProposed Conceptual \nS.B. 283  C  1  Senator Yvanna D.

(BDR 38-919) \n \nSENATOR NICOLE J. CANNIZZARO (Senatorial District No. 6): \nI am here to present S.B. 425 for your consideration. This bill seeks to amend \nthe  State  Plan  for  Medicaid  to  provide  certain  additional  home  and \ncommunity-based services.  \n \nHaving  a  safe  and  stable  place  to  call  home  is  critical  for  every  Nevadan. \nUnfortunately, achieving this goal is more difficult for individuals with long-term \ndisabilities. These include those with serious mental illness (SMI), those with \nintellectual or developmental disabilities, frail elderly populations, the chronically \nhomeless  and  other  vulnerable  populations  who  have  low  or  no  income. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2019 \nPage 5 \n \nIndividuals with long-term disabilities often rely on federal programs for support \nsuch as Supplemental Security Income or Social Security Disability Insurance. \nThis income is generally insufficient to fully cover the cost of food, housing, \nmedicine and other expenses. Unless these individuals receive rental assistance \nor live with other household members who have additional income, they will \nlikely experience difficulty finding affordable housing. \n \nIn Nevada, community-based housing models provide housing in different levels \nand types of supportive services to certain individuals with SMI, intellectual \ndisabilities or those who are frail and elderly. While housing model populations \nserved and funding mechanisms vary, each provides a bed in a home in the \ncommunity for individuals with similar disabilities.  \n \nIn  the  past,  some  of  these  congregate  care  living  situations  have  received \nsignificant  attention.  News  stories  have  described  horrific  living  conditions. \nAudits  by  the  Legislative  Counsel  Bureau  have  come  to  varied  conclusions. \nWhile  certain  types  of  housing  arrangements  were  found  to  have  dismal \nconditions with serious deficient unsanitary and unsafe conditions, others were \nfound to be providing homes generally clean, safe and in good repair.  \n \nWe need to look at housing support services available to individuals either as \npart of, or separate from the housing models, possible funding mechanisms and \nother ways to improve services. \n  \nFrom  a  legislative  perspective,  this  work  began  last  Session.  During  the \n2017-2018  Interim,  the  Legislative  Committee  on  Health  Care  studied  the \ncongregate living and community-based support services available to individuals \nwith mental health conditions. The study included a comprehensive review and \nevaluation  of  the  rates  the  State  pays  to  group  homes  contracting  with \nSouthern Nevada Adult Mental Health Services through the Division of Public \nand Behavioral Health and Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).  \n \nThe resulting report highlights a number of key issues. We found the existing \nsystem of housing and supportive services for individuals with SMI is neither \nbuilt around nor operated in the best interest of the individuals who are often \nplaced in housing models not based on their needs, but on availability of beds. \nHousing providers are more likely to serve individuals who require a high number \nof service hours and are financially disincentivized from helping clients progress \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2019 \nPage 6 \n \nto  their  highest  level  of  independence,  which  corresponds  to  fewer  service \nhours and lower reimbursement.  \n \nThe report identifies the disparity between the funding mechanisms available to \nhelp serve individuals with different types of disabilities. For example, the State \ncurrently receives federal funding through what are known as Medicaid 1915(c) \nwaivers to support the intellectually disabled and frail elderly populations, but \nnot for those with mental illness. The report also shows available funding, as \nwell as existing regulatory and reimbursement structures, impact the quality of \nhousing and services received.  \n \nThe Legislature is working to address many of these issues through at least \nsix bills proposed this Session. Certain bills address the results of the audits line \nby  line.  Others  address  unlicensed  facilities,  and  still  others  aim  to  address \nproblems  with  the  existing  licensing  and  regulatory  structures  for  these \ncongregate care living arrangements.  \n \nSenate  Bill  425  specifically  focuses  on  expanding  federal  funds  the  State \nreceives to assist with housing and supportive services to better serve these \nvulnerable populations. It requires the Director of DHHS to preserve a Home and \nCommunity Based Services Benefit, 1915(i), from the federal government to \nenhance funding for home and community-based services. One of the goals of \nthe benefit is to improve home and community-based services for the vulnerable \npopulations  needing  it  most.  Based  on  recent  audits  and  reports,  many \nNevadans with SMI could see significant improvements in quality of housing, \ncare, services, and life with this change. \n \nSTEPHANIE WOODARD (Division of Public and Behavioral Health, Department of \nHealth and Human Services): \nI  will  present  an  overview  of  Supportive  Housing  and  Tenancy  Supports \n(Exhibit G).  \n \nThe concept of supportive housing and tenancy supports is not new to Nevada. \nIt has been worked on for several years. It has been one of the priorities coming \nout of the Governor's Interagency Council on Homelessness and identified as a \nkey strategy needing to be considered for additional funding. In addition, we \nhave engaged the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in what is \ncalled an Innovator Accelerator Program. We partnered with them and received \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2019 \nPage 7 \n \nintensive technical assistance to determine what types of tenancy supports and \nsupportive housing would be most appropriate for Nevada. \n \nWhen we talk about homelessness in this context, we are looking beyond the \ncurrent  Housing  and  Urban  Development  (HUD)  definition  for  chronically \nhomeless.  The  chronically  homeless  definition  used  by  HUD  is  considered \nrelatively  restrictive  as  an  individual  would  have  to  be  homeless  for  up  to \n12 months. By using a different definition, we can begin to provide services for \nindividuals before they reach a period of chronicity. We believe this is important \nfor a number of reasons, not the least of which is to provide those supportive \nservices to assist individuals in regaining housing relatively quickly, or those at \nrisk for losing their housing. \n \nWhen we began to develop the concept for the 1915(i), we had to determine \nthe target population we wanted to identify as beneficiaries for this program. \nWe worked with all Continuum of Care Programs (CoCs), north, south and rural, \nto  include  the  populations  in  the  homeless  housing  queue.  This  system  is \ntypically called the Homeless Management Information System (HMIS). When \nwe pulled the information from the three CoCs to determine what homelessness \ncurrently  looked  like  Statewide,  we  saw  there  were  a  number  of  different \nindividuals across different types of housing supports. This gave us a good \nbaseline of the number of individuals a program like this could potentially touch. \n \nWe  engaged  the  CoC  in  meaningful  discussions  to  identify  which  currently \nhomeless individuals would most benefit from a program of supportive housing. \nEach CoC provides a vulnerability assessment of individuals entering into the \nsystem,  looking  at  a  number  of  factors.  The  Vulnerability  Index  -  Service \nPrioritization Decision Assistance Tool (VI-SPDAT) is used in northern and rural \nNevada. The Community Housing Assessment Tool (CHAT) is used in southern \nNevada. These tools are used to help determine not only vulnerability, but also \nprioritization for individuals in need of housing, additional case management and \nsupportive services.  \n \nWe needed to identify individuals with certain types of vulnerability index scores \nto target these scores, breaking them into tiers. We identified Tiers II and III for \nbeing the target population; Tier I is individuals with relatively low scores. Tier I \nindividuals  typically  do  not  have  a  high  rate  of  issues,  vulnerabilities  or \ndisabilities and would benefit from services, not specifically supportive housing. \nTier IV individuals tend to be higher on the vulnerability indices scores, as well \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2019 \nPage 8 \n \nas have multiple issues or disabilities, likely being too great to provide them with \na program like supportive housing. \n \nIn this instance, the VI-SPDAT and CHAT vulnerability assessments will be used \nas the screening tool. It is not going to be the ultimate element to determine \nwhether or not someone qualifies for this program.  \n \nIt was also necessary to look at the types of individuals in the housing queues in \nthe  HMIS,  looking  at  the  prevalence  of  disabilities  by  different  types  of \ndisabilities. We have quite a few individuals with physical and developmental \ndisabilities,  chronic  health  conditions,  human  immunodeficiency  viruses  and \nmental health and substance abuse issues. In previous discussions, the target \npopulations  were  only  those  with  behavioral  health  disorders.  We  felt  we \nneeded to expand that population to identify individuals having other disabilities, \nsuch as intellectual or developmental disabilities, who could also benefit from \nsupportive housing services. \n \nWe  are  talking  about  tenancy  supports,  housing  case  management  or \ncoordination of care when we talk about supportive housing. Tenancy supports \ninclude outreach and engagement to homeless individuals, helping them develop \napplications  for  housing,  as  well  as  developing  service  plans  for  them  to \nsuccessfully maintain tenancy once they achieve housing.  \n \nCoordination of care is what we would consider part of the lynch pin of what is \nprovided in supportive housing as it offers an opportunity for individuals with \nmultiple needs to have care coordinated across different systems. This could \ninclude health care and behavioral health, as well as address many of the social \ndeterminates  of  health  we  know  can  continue  to  interrupt  an  individual's \nprocess to successfully maintain housing. \n \nSupportive housing is an evidence-based practice implemented in both large and \nsmall  jurisdictions  and  counties,  having  time  to  research  and  generate  data \nsupporting its use. It has an impact on the cost of care for individuals who are \nhomeless. A study found supportive housing is no more and sometimes less \ncostly than not providing supportive housing in certain areas. It can have an \nimpact  on  lower  bed  days  related  to  psychiatric  admissions,  as  well  as \nincarcerations. It can lower overall health care costs of individuals participating \nin supportive housing. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2019 \nPage 9 \n \nSUZANNE BIERMAN (Administrator, Division of Health Care Financing and Policy, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nThese issues have been the subject of conversation for a number of years. We \nhave  a  timeline  outlining  the  Division  of  Health  Care  Financing  and  Policy \n(DHCFP) efforts to address the issues and develop additional services.  \n \nIn 2018, the DHHS held a Housing Summit in Reno addressing the housing \ncrisis and worked on developing a plan to support those most vulnerable. By \n2018, the Regional Behavioral Health Policy Board had been established. One of \nthe  recommendations  made  was  to  provide  the  1915(i)  benefit  funded  by \nMedicaid to help address the issue. \n \nIn 2018, when the DHCFP was working together with the Governor's Office in \nputting  together  the  budget,  these  services  were  ultimately  included.  The \nDHCFP also has a decision unit in our current budget that would fund these \nservices for the next biennium.  \n \nIn 2019, proposed legislation required the Director of the Statewide Program for \nSuicide Prevention to create a State Plan option to provide tenancy support. It \nwill also provide additional information on our process in working with CMS to \nobtain and get these services approved and implemented. In March, a working \ngroup drafted an amendment which will be submitted to CMS. Stakeholders \nhave been involved in this process and there have been meetings with the CoC \ngroup for draft input. In July, we plan to hold a series of public workshops to \ndiscuss the concept with stakeholders and solicit feedback on the Program.  \n \nFollowing the workshops, there will be a series of public hearings once we have \na  developed  State  Plan  amendment  and  proposed  changes  to  the  Medicaid \nService Manual. We anticipate holding the workshops in September and October \nof 2019. Finally, we plan to submit the State Plan amendment that would add \nthese services to the Nevada Medicaid State Plan by the end of September \n2019. We look to implement the Plan in January 2020. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWhat will be the cost of this plan? \n \nMS. BIERMAN: \nThe DHCFP budget for the upcoming biennium for all funds has been projected \nat $3,227,000 for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020; the State share being approximately \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2019 \nPage 10 \n \n$621,000. For FY 2021, $6.5 million with a State share of $1.3 million. All of \nthis is included in our current proposed budget. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs it possible this could be used to fund caseworkers who would be working to \nmove folks out of perhaps a tent city arrangement to get them housing? Could \nthis be used for folks with a serious mental illness who may be at risk for losing \ntheir housing? \n \nMS. BIERMAN: \nThis would provide wraparound services allowing people to find and maintain \nhousing. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAre  there  specific  services  for  the  possibility  of  funding  case  managers  for \ncommunity  organizations  or  intervention  work  on  the  potential  list  of \npossibilities? \n \nMS. WOODARD: \nI believe care coordination and outreach are services that would be reimbursable \nunder this model. \n \nJENNIFER JEANS (Washoe Legal Services; Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada): \nWashoe Legal Services and the Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada support \nS.B. 425. \n \nJOAN HALL (Nevada Rural Hospital Partners): \nNevada  Rural  Hospital  Partners  supports  S.B.  425.  I  was  involved  in  the \nRegional Behavioral Health Policy Boards during the Interim. This came up as an \nissue time and again. We believe this would be a great solution to a large \nproblem. \n \nGRETA SEIDMAN (Nevada HAND): \nNevada  HAND  supports  S.B.  425.  I  will  read  from  my  written  testimony \n(Exhibit H). \n \nANGELA QUINN (FirstMed Health and Wellness Centers): \nI am the CEO of FirstMed Health and Wellness Centers, a federally qualified \nhealth center in Clark County. We are in support of S.B. 425.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2019 \nPage 11 \n \nIn 2018, we served 25,000 individuals, 40 percent of the clients being primary \ncare and behavioral health recipients. Out of those 25,000 individuals, 2,500 \nindicated housing and security was their biggest concern. These are folks who \nare homeless, living at Catholic charities or couch surfing. To date this year, to \ndate, we have seen 67 young adults between the ages of 16 and 24 coming to \nus for mental health services. Housing was their core issue. This bill will begin \nto solve some of the problems. \n \nI have five individuals I pay general revenue for supportive services as part of \nour  three-legged  stool  of  supportive  services,  behavioral  health  and  primary \ncare.  With  Medicaid  funding  to  offset  the  cost,  I  can  put  those  funds  into \nhousing and more direct services for clients rather than salaries. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nHow are we getting this information to veterans, as well as emancipated or \nhomeless youth? \n \nMS. WOODARD: \nWe need to continue to consider this question as we develop the 1915(i). We \nare going to be pursuing several public hearings where we will have robust \ndiscussion on how we not only operationalize the 1915(i), but how we will get \nthe word out so people know these services will be available to them. \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nWould you be developing policies around how to provide the information, and is \nthere a priority?  \n \nMS. WOODARD: \nThis is all part of the discussion we need to have. We have the vulnerability \nindices already used by the CoC which do an amazing job, as well as many of \nthe nonprofit organizations providing housing support now. It is, at this time, \nnot a reimbursable service.  \n \nThe CoCs are doing street outreach and have coordinated entry so individuals \nwho do touch social services, and may have an issue with homelessness or \nhousing insecurity, are currently being brought into the system. We do not want \nto re-create the wheel, we want to optimize the systems already in place and \nprovide an additional funding stream so the services can be reimbursable.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2019 \nPage 12 \n \nWe have many agencies and organizations Statewide that have been doing this \nfor quite some time. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWould it be accurate to say this is not a new program, but a way to fund the \nwork that has been done, leveraging it with federal dollars? If you are serving \nthat population and able to bill Medicaid, you would be able to build programs to \nserve that population using this Medicaid waiver. \n \nMS. WOODARD: \nThat is accurate. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 425 and open the hearing on S.B. 483. \n \nSENATE  BILL  483:  Revises  provisions  governing  the  Statewide  Program  for \nSuicide Prevention. (BDR 40-1163) \n \nSENATOR DALLAS HARRIS (Senatorial District No. 11): \nI am here to present S.B. 483 for your consideration.  \n \nIn 2017, 627 Nevadans took their own lives; that is nearly 2 people per day. \nThis figure represents a higher death rate than those who die from an opioid \noverdose,  which  we  call  an  epidemic.  It  represents  nearly  three  times  the \nnumber of individuals who die by homicide. Preventing suicide is, therefore, \neveryone's business. This bill builds on a lot of the same premises expanding \nthe  list  of  these  people  to  whom  training  of  suicide  prevention  must  be \nprovided.  \n \nExisting law creates the Statewide Program for Suicide Prevention in the DHHS. \nThe Program is required to provide training programs for suicide prevention for \nlaw  enforcement  personnel,  providers  of  health  care,  school  employees  and \nothers interacting with those at risk of suicide. Senate Bill 483 will include \nfamily members of those at risk of suicide in the list of people to whom such \ntraining must be provided. In addition, the bill requires the Coordinator of the \nProgram to establish a program of free suicide prevention training for family \nmembers  of those  at risk of suicide.  This includes training, recognizing and \nproductively interacting with people at risk of suicide and how to refer such \nindividuals to suicide intervention and prevention professionals. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2019 \nPage 13 \n \nI want to help veterans and this bill does not contain the word \"veterans\". \nHowever, when I reached out to a few of the veteran advocates visiting today, \nthey are already heavily using this program. The veterans would like to be able \nto use it for free, and increase the use for everyone. This is one of their top \nrecommendations on what can be done to help their community.  \n \nThe more people who know how to recognize and assist a person experiencing \nsuicidal thoughts or behaviors, the more people will get help.  \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nHow does this bill differ, or compliment, what Senator Spearman has presented \nwith the First Aid bill? \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nI believe these bills work in conjunction, supplementing each other. The Mental \nHealth First Aid Program to train community members on how to identify and \nassist a person with a mental health crisis is one piece. This bill is to expand on \nprograms currently offered in the Office of Suicide Prevention at the DHHS \nwhere family members of those at risk can go for training and ensure these \nprograms are free for everyone.  \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nEverything we are doing this Session reaches out to cast a broad net when we \nlook at the statistics for the completion of suicide. One of the groups we rarely \ntalk about are family members, particularly children, of veterans whose suicide \nideation is sometimes a direct result of a parent's deployment, illness or death. \nThis is not duplicative, but complimentary. \n \nKIMBERLY MULL: \nI am in support of S.B. 483. Today is the 60-day mark of my graduation from a \nresidential treatment center for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and other \ndisorders. Sixteen months ago, I was raped in my home in south Reno. Like 13 \npercent of rape victims, I became another statistic. I used an unloaded gun I \nkept in a safety case to run my rapist out of my home. Now I sleep with it \nloaded in my nightstand. During a very dark time, I found myself spending hours \nloading and unloading that same gun. I would post pictures of it in my hand on \nsocial media with no comment; no one noticed.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2019 \nPage 14 \n \nComing up on the one year mark of the anniversary of my rape, I began to make \nplans for the care of my dog and looking up the dates for my father's next \ndoctor's  appointment.  I  knew  I  needed  help.  Without  the  support  of  my \nemployer and losing income, in December I checked myself into treatment.  \n \nFamilies of victims of crime, especially those of sexual assault, need to know \nthe signs of severe depression, PTSD and suicidal ideation. This bill will save \nlives.  \n \nANDY LEPEILBET (Military Order of the Purple Heart): \nI represent the Military Order of the Purple Heart which is combat wounded \nveterans. We support S.B. 483. We would like you to think about its importance \nfrom the point of view of the veteran. In WWII, our veterans knew when they \nwent to war they were not coming back until it was over. In Vietnam, we knew \nwe would be there one to three tours. Our young veterans today now go from \none to eight or nine tours. We have never had our Guard deployed so often. We \nhave a lot of young people at risk and it is our job to help them. \n \nMICHAEL ROACH (American Legion; United Veterans Legislative Counsel): \nThe  American  Legion  and  the  United  Veterans  Legislative  Counsel  support \nS.B. 483.  Every  year  prior  to  Session,  the  Nevada  Department  of  Veterans \nServices, along with United Veterans Legislative Counsel, hold symposiums in \nReno  and  Las  Vegas.  During  these  symposiums,  one  of  the  main  topics  is \nveteran suicide. \n \nMS. HALL: \nNevada Rural Hospital Partners (NRHP) supports S.B. 483. Through a Health \nResources  and  Services  Administration  behavioral  health  grant,  which  NRHP \nwas awarded, we looked at many behavioral health issues. Suicide rose to the \ntop  of  the  issues  that  were  of  concern  in  rural  Nevada.  We  were  recently \nawarded  a  grant  to  implement  a  community  paramedicine  integrated  health \nprogram. Nevada Rural Hospital Partners will be using the program providers to \npreform suicide assessments assisting family members in their homes. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI would like to put on the record that we have one of our National Guard units in \nNevada that in the last 15 months have had more than 10 suicides. The most \nrecent of those suicides was two months ago, a young woman who was not \nyet 30 years old with a family. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2019 \nPage 15 \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nAt times I may ask you to make tough choices; this is not one of those times. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nI will entertain a motion on S.B. 483. \n \nSENATOR WOODHOUSE MOVED TO DO PASS S.B. 483. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 483 and open the hearing on S.B. 424. \n \nSENATE BILL 424: Revises provisions governing services for persons with a \nmental illness. (BDR 39-964) \n \nSENATOR JAMES OHRENSCHALL (Senatorial District No. 21): \nI am here to present S.B. 424 for your consideration.  \n \nExisting law requires the Division of Public and Behavioral Health (DPBH) of the \nDHHS  to  adopt  regulations  that  specify  the  circumstances  under  which  a \nconsumer of mental health services is eligible to receive those services from the \nDPBH. Senate Bill 424 simply requires those regulations to prescribe a system \nto categorize consumers by the scope of the services they need, and establish \nprocedures by which a consumer of those mental health services, or a provider, \nmay appeal a decision of the DPBH concerning eligibility or authorization for \nservices.  \n \nI spoke with many providers who brought this situation to my attention. We \nneed to obtain more services for patients than are being provided or authorized \ntoday. This bill will establish a process to appeal decisions if either the patient \nor provider feels what is being authorized is not adequate.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2019 \nPage 16 \n \nJOE TINIO (Adult Residential Care Providers of Nevada, ECHO): \nI am the Chairman and CEO of Adult Residential Care Providers of Nevada, also \nknown as ECHO, an emergency care help organization representing the majority \nof residential care homes in Nevada. One-third of our staff are providers of \nmental health services. We have come here to show our support for S.B. 424 \nand will read from my written testimony (Exhibit I). \n \nRON SUMBANG (Adult Residential Care Providers of Nevada, ECHO): \nI  am  the  Vice  President  of  the  Adult  Residential  Care  Providers  of  Nevada, \nECHO. We would like to show our support for S.B. 424 in reference to the \ncategorization and appeal process. These two go hand-in-hand due to many of \nour providers have entered into contracts for a specific period of time, and in \nthe process have experienced a change midway through a contract. They were \nnot being paid the amount that was agreed on in the contract, yet the services \nprovided remained the same. This is one of the reasons the services provided \nwere misconstrued.  \n \nWhen an inspector finds a person requires a certain level of care and that level \nof care is not provided, it is not the provider's fault as their hours have been \ncut.  The  appeal  process  would  provide  a  venue  for  providers  to  bring  their \nconcerns around a particular decision. For example, this could be the reduction \nin hours or to justify they are attempting to provide the level of care required \nwith the reduction in hours.  \n \nMS. JEANS: \nWashoe  Legal  Services  and  Legal  Aid  Center  of  Southern  Nevada  support \nS.B. 424. Many of our clients are reliant on the mental health services provided \nby  Northern  and  Southern  Nevada  Adult  Mental  Health  Services.  They  are \nproviders of last resort, and the services provided are often essential to keep our \nclients housed, out of jail and have their most basic needs met.  \n \nNearly 70 years ago, the United States Supreme Court determined due process \nmust be afforded by an administrative agency to the extent its actions may \ncondemn an individual to suffer grievous loss.  \n \nAn individual who has been denied mental health services by a provider of last \nresort will most certainly suffer grievous loss in its most fundamental form. The \nlack of an appeal process for these essential services constitutes a deficiency \nthat  has  been  overlooked  for  far  too  long.  Our  current  laws  require \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2019 \nPage 17 \n \nadministrative  processes  for  other  benefits  including  unemployment \ncompensation, Medicaid, Welfare, food stamps and county assistance. \n \nTINA ANGAT: \nI am a provider in a Community-Based Living Arrangement home in southern \nNevada and support S.B. 424. \n \nSTEVE SPENTZAKIS (Minds Matter): \nI am representing Minds Matter, Las Vegas. This bill will be a great asset for our \nclients, allowing us to provide additional support. It is important to have a good \nappeal process such as what Medicaid has. I support S.B. 424. \n \nTHELMA BALINGIT: \nI  am  a  provider  for  Joran,  LLC,  and  support  S.B.  424.  I  appreciate  the \nopportunity for the appeal process. We have contracts from the State that are \ngoing to be changed midway and we will be able to appeal those changes with \nthe passage of this bill. If they cut our hours, the services we provide will also \nbe cut.  \n \nLIZ ANGAT: \nI am a provider for Klaus Enterprises, LLC, and support S.B. 424.  \n \nSENATOR OHRENSCHALL: \nIn  private  insurance,  if  a  physician  wants  us  to  have  a  procedure  and  the \ninsurance  denies  the  procedure,  we  have  an  appeal  process.  I  believe  it  is \ncommon sense to allow the appeal process for our mental health patients. In \nmany cases, they may not be able to file an appeal on their own and may need \nthe assistance of the providers handling their care.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will entertain a motion on S.B. 424. \n \nSENATOR HARDY MOVED TO DO PASS S.B. 424. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2019 \nPage 18 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 424. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will entertain a motion on S.B. 425. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN MOVED TO DO PASS S.B. 425. \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nI will open the hearing on S.B. 457. \n \nSENATE  BILL  457:  Revises  provisions  relating  to  health  care  facilities. \n(BDR 40-1143) \n \nSENATOR JULIA RATTI (Senatorial District No. 13):  \nI am here to present S.B. 457 for your consideration. There have been some \nsignificant  incidents  in  the  news  regarding  unfortunate  events  that  have \nhappened in certain treatment facilities in Las Vegas. The events surrounding \nthose incidents raised some questions about whether or not we were doing \nenough to ensure we knew what was happening and be able to evaluate the \nnecessary actions to be taken. \n \nThis  bill  enhances  reporting  requirements  for  certain  facilities  and  requires \ncertain information concerning the licensing status and quality of facilities that \nprovide drug and alcohol abuse treatment to be posted online by the DPBH and \nthe DHHS. \n \nAccording  to  the  National  Survey  on  Drug  Use  and  Health,  3  percent  of \nNevadans 12 years of age and older reported having an illicit drug use disorder \nin 2016. The same year, just over 5 percent of Nevadans 12 years of age and \nolder  reported  having  an  alcohol  use  disorder.  While  the  portion  of  the \npopulation reporting an alcohol use disorder has decreased in recent years, the \nportion reporting a drug use disorder has increased. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2019 \nPage 19 \n \nSubstance  use  disorders  are  preventable  and  treatable,  and  while  there  are \nbenefits to treatment, recent research shows that many people do not receive \nthe treatment they need. According to the federal Substance Abuse and Mental \nHealth Services Administration, in 2014, 1 percent of the total adult population \nNationwide,  or  7.5  percent  of  adults  who  reported  having  a  substance  use \ndisorder in the past year, received treatment. We know there is not enough \ntreatment  available  and  not  enough  of  our  community  members  who  need \ntreatment are receiving it. \n \nIn Nevada, recent news articles have exposed numerous deaths at drug and \nalcohol treatment facilities in the State. These facilities are not monitored by the \nState, nor are they required to report to any authority events such as patient \ndeaths.  In  fact,  the  only  way  such  events  at  a  privately  funded,  nonprofit \nmedical facility may come to the attention of State regulators is if a complaint is \nfiled. As a State, we also need to ensure people getting into the business of \nproviding these treatment services are doing what is necessary to ensure the \nproviders are qualified, appropriated and well-regulated. \n \nThe deaths at such facilities should be reported and this information should be \navailable to the public. Nevadans would also benefit from the availability of a \nbroader  set  of  indicators  to  better  understand  the  quality  of  non-medical \nlicensed facilities. When people seek treatment in Nevada for a drug or alcohol \nuse  disorder,  they  should  be  able  to  make  informed  decisions  about  their \noptions. \n \nThe bottom line is that our regulatory processes should result in families having \nthe information they need to make choices about where to receive support and \nservices. Senate Bill 457 moves Nevada in the right direction. We currently have \na sentinel events reporting system for  medical facilities. This bill takes that \nexisting system and expands it to a broader group of facilities.  \n \nWe would like to go beyond only reporting deaths, and get to a point where we \nare also reporting an assessment of the licensing standards and quality for these \nfacilities. Through  legislation,  the  intent  is  to  direct  the  DHHS  to  fulfill  this \nthrough the regulatory process, compiling a website where evaluations of these \ntypes of facilities are prescriptive to Nevada Revised Statutes. The intent is also \nto  report  sentinel  events  providing  DHHS,  through  the  regulatory  process, \ndirection  to  create  more  information  than  just  sentinel  events  happening  at \nthese licensed facilities. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2019 \nPage 20 \n \nMS. WOODARD: \nWe have had an opportunity to speak extensively about the implications of this \nnew legislation. Currently, there are reporting requirements for facilities that are \nlicensed and called medical facilities. This expands the reporting requirements to \ninclude health facilities, expanding the scope to include our substance abuse \ntreatment facilities.  \n \nBecause those facilities are licensed, it is important we maintain a high level of \nquality of the care occurring within those facilities. It will also allow us to begin \ndeveloping, through the regulatory process, a way to bring to measure and \nreport on the quality of care provided within those facilities. \n \nAs a treatment provider in the past, working with families to find high-quality \nfacilities matching their needs can be incredibly difficult. Having a repository of \ninformation  that  families  and  individuals  seeking  treatment  could  access  for \nimportant information related to a facility, reported deaths or sentinel events \nand the quality provided at the facility, will go a long way in helping individuals \nand families find the care they need. \n \nWe  welcome  the  opportunity  to  continue  to  work  toward  developing  those \nregulations. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nSection  18,  subsection  1,  paragraph  (d)  states  \"unlicensed\"  programs  of \ntreatment for the abuse of alcohol and drugs. How do you find out where these \nfacilities are located and how they are operating? \n \nMS. WOODARD: \nWe certify all levels of care for our substance abuse treatment facilities and \nprograms.  We  have  a  certification  that  exists  for  all  out-patient  treatment \nproviders. The licensure and certification covers those that are licensed. Rarely \ndo we have providers operating as substance abuse treatment providers that are \nnot also certified. We do have requirements for those certified providers to be \nable to provide information to us. We have the latitude, under the Board of \nHealth, to amend our Division criteria to add additional requirements related to \nreporting, which we would be able to do under this legislation. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2019 \nPage 21 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWould the program cover 12 step programs done by a church? Will Alcoholics \nAnonymous, the Triangle Club or other programs qualify? \n \nMS. WOODARD: \nThey do not constitute certified programs. Those types of programs fall outside \nof the programs we typically certify. \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nI believe we dealt with this in the Interim. Individuals obtain a license and have \nan ABC shop; but you have no idea what they are actually doing. Perhaps they \nare purporting to be a licensed facility, but the patients sent there do not know \nthey are not a licensed facility. How do we get a handle on that? \n \nMS. WOODARD: \nWhat we have included in our certification is a very rigorous review of the \nquality of the care being provided. We do chart reviews, we look at policies and \nprocedures  and  look  at  the  availability  of  staffing  and  training  they  have \nreceived.  Our  State  certification  sets  what  the  standard  is  to  ensure  our \nproviders meet that minimum level of certification standard. \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nThat would be for those who are seeking to be certified. How do we ensure \npeople are not circumventing the system and putting up a sign to say they are \nin business, even though they are unlicensed? \n \nMS. WOODARD: \nOne additional qualifier to that is if a provider wants to bill Medicaid, or receive \nadditional  public  funds,  they  are  required  by  statute  to  be  certified.  We \nrecognize that may produce some type of gap where individuals or programs are \nnot billing Medicaid, nor are they trying to receive any public funding. In that \ncase, we currently do not have jurisdiction to do much about the way they are \noperating. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThe instances bringing this to my attention made me choose to act and ask the \nDHHS if there was something we can do with regard to the multiple deaths \nhappening at an entity that was certified and licensed. We still do not have \nmuch in the way of the kind of information we are collecting or sharing. The \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2019 \nPage 22 \n \nfirst step would be to get to the point of having the sentinel reporting; knowing \nfrom those facilities the trends that may be inappropriate or would raise a red \nflag, or help us as policymakers or regulators to choose to act on this issue. \n \nThe second step would be to create a website for family members to use to find \nlists of licensed, regulated facilities. This would help in terms of the  public \neducation campaign. If people do end up going to a facility for treatment that is \nnot a licensed or certified facility, we can give people the information about the \nlist on the website. We are also hoping to get more robust information on the \nwebsite  about  the  track  record  of  a  particular  facility.  Right  now,  there  is \nnothing on licensed and certified, or unlicensed and uncertified facilities.  \n \nHEIDI GUSTAFSON (Foundation for Recovery): \nI am in support of S.B. 457 and will read from my written testimony (Exhibit J). \nIf treatment companies have this particular designation through the State, they \nwould more likely promote that information on their websites. \n \nThere are honest providers in Nevada who support this bill. We actually keep \nsome providers out of our State because they do not want to play in these \nmurky waters as we are not well-licensed and regulated. The bill would make it \nmore difficult for the bad actors wanting to provide services when they see a \nsentinel event reporting system being implemented. \n \nHELEN FOLEY (Nevada Assisted Living Association): \nI represent the Nevada Assisted Living Association and we do not oppose in any \nway the substance, nor the intention of the bill. One issue we have is when it \napplies  to  senior  living.  In  senior  complexes  there  are  many  aging  people \nreceiving hospice care. Everyone is unfortunately on their way out of this life. \nAssisted  living  facilities  are  not  medical  facilities.  We  are  not  healthcare \nfacilities, but this would make us one although we have no doctors or nurses in \nthe facilities. We have deaths occurring quite often.  \n \nIn a situation where someone dies, there would need to be an investigation, \nwhich would be problematic for us. We would not mind if there were suspicious \nsituations surrounding the death, but in senior facilities, people eventually die. I \nwould like Ms. Bishop Parise to further explain the dilemma we are in and offer \nsome potential solutions. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2019 \nPage 23 \n \nJEANNE BISHOP PARISE (Park Place Assisted Living): \nI am currently the Administrator at Park Place Assisted Living. I was originally \nlicensed  with  license  number  156  as  a  skilled  nursing  facility  administrator. \nRecently, I took the board exam for community and home-based hospice and \nhome health. I am one of two health services executives qualified in the State. \n \nWithin the residential facilities for groups, we have self-reported many of the \nevents on the list the skilled nursing facilities and hospitals are reporting within \nsentinel events. We have to report suspected abuse or neglect and attempted \nsuicide  or  elopement,  which  might  meet  the  qualifiers  to  report  to  Elder \nProtective Services. We are also surveyed by the Nevada Bureau of Health Care \nQuality and Compliance. They will review our incident reports to manage them \nwith appropriate follow-up. \n \nOnce again, we are not medical facilities with registered nurses or doctors on \nstaff; we have certified med-techs. The majority of the population we serve are \nseniors 70 to 80 years of age. Many of them, when no longer able to anticipate \nwellness from a rehab standpoint and have chronic illness trending to passing, \nthey will be placed on hospice.  \n \nIn a given year, the majority of patients are anticipated deaths, and this is how \nwe qualify them. We anticipate they are going to pass, but cannot ascertain \nwhether they are natural or unnatural deaths as we are not professionals. On \naverage, each year I have only had two die who were not on hospice. The \nmajority of those we had recommended to families, along with conversations \nwith physicians, to place them on hospice as they transitioned. They opted not \nto, as is their right. \n \nSkilled  nursing  facilities  and  hospitals  have  medical  records  and  attending \nphysicians. When someone dies, the physician signs off on the death certificate. \nThe death certificate lists whether it was natural causes or not. We do not close \nthe  loop  in  the  record.  It  is  very  difficult  for  us  to  even  have  sharing  of \ninformation from medical facilities.  \n \nThe bill speaks to administrative sanctions for both medical and non-medical \nservices. It is the same rate; one size fits all which is not appropriate given the \nfact there is Medicare, Medicaid and larger dollars involved. This is sometimes \nten times the daily revenue a small group home or residential facility for groups \nor assisted living would receive.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2019 \nPage 24 \n \nWe also do not have the administrative staff or resources in our business model \nor price point to consumers to have a burdensome reporting requirement. This \nneeds to be balanced against public safety and reporting to uncover the bad \noperator scenarios impacting human lives with repeated adverse events.  \n \nWe do not have a problem with the portions of the bill that refer to treatment \nfacilities for alcohol and drug abuse where they have repeated adverse events \nresulting  in  death.  Nor  do  we  have  problems  with  any  of  the  unlicensed \nCommunity-Based Living Arrangements.  \n \nA simple form could be developed to report unanticipated deaths. There could \nbe an age threshold applied to when a death occurred in someone over 70 years \nof age and was not reportable. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nI  would  suggest  a  huddle  with  the  Bureau  of  Health  Care  Quality  and \nCompliance in the DHHS to take another look at the bill. There is some language \nexempting an investigation in the event of natural causes. There may be some \nother ways to address the concerns raised today.  \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 457. \n   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2019 \nPage 25 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSeeing no further business, this hearing is adjourned at 5:50 p.m. \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nVickie Polzien, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2019 \nPage 26 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nExhibit / \nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \n# of pages \n  A  2    Agenda \n  B  5    Attendance Roster \nS.B. 266    C  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 315  D  3  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 362  E  4  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 370  F  2  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nStephanie Woodard / \nPresentation on Supportive \nSuzanne Bierman / \nS.B. 425  G  12  Housing and Tenancy \nDepartment of Health and \nSupports \nHuman Services \nGreta Seidman / Nevada \nS.B. 425  H  2  Testimony of Support \nHand \nJoe Tinio / Adult Residential \nS.B. 424  I  1  Care Providers of Nevada,  Testimony of Support \nECHO \nS.B. 457  J  4  Heidi Gustafson  Testimony of Support \n ", "31": "\nMINUTES OF THE  \nSENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n \nEightieth Session \nApril 15, 2019 \n \n \nThe Senate Committee on Health and Human Services was called to order by \nChair Julia Ratti at 4:04 p.m. on Monday, April 15, 2019, in Room 2135 of the \nLegislative Building, Carson City, Nevada.

(BDR 38-177) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN LESLEY E. COHEN (Assembly District No. 29): \nI am here today to present A.B. 130 for your consideration.  \n \nThis bill would move the Nevada Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) \nSavings Program entirely under the authority of the State Treasurer. The Nevada \nABLE Savings Program is based on the federal ABLE Act of 2014. This Program \nprovides  for  a  special  tax  advantage  savings  account  for  persons  with  a \ndisability and their family members. The first $100,000 in an ABLE account \ndoes not count against the Medicaid or Supplemental Security Income resource \nlimits.  The  ABLE  Act  allows  eligible  Nevadans  with  disabilities  to  create  a \nspecial savings account for many personal expenses aimed at making their lives \neasier. Family members and friends can also contribute to the account.  \n \nDuring  the  Interim,  Committee  members  received  testimony  of  the  need  to \ncreate a more streamlined administrative process for the ABLE Program. The \nrevisions would provide for one entity to represent the State in all decisions \nregarding the National ABLE Alliance and ensure there is ultimate accountability \nfor the growth and health of the Program.  \n \nUnder current law, Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 427A.896 requires the State \nTreasurer to establish the ABLE Program, and the Aging and Disabilities Services \nDivision  (ADSD)  of  the  Department  of  Health  and  Humans  Services  to \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 15, 2019 \nPage 3 \n \nimplement an outreach and educational program designed to create awareness \nof  and  increase  participation  in  the  ABLE  Savings  Program.  The  ADSD  is \nauthorized  to  employ  personnel  and  enter  into  contracts  to  carry  out  the \nprovisions of the ABLE Program. However, it was the understanding of the \nInterim Committee that no money has been included in the ADSD budget to \nsupport these efforts. \n \nThe  bill  would  transfer  all  duties  and  authority  of  the  ADSD  to  the  State \nTreasurer, including the duty to implement an outreach and education program.  \n \nI  had  a  meeting  with  Amy  Garland,  Executive  Officer  with  the  Nevada \nDepartment of Veterans Services. Ms. Garland is the mother of a young woman \nwith special needs and advocates for Nevada veterans. She spends a great deal \nof her day outside of working hours advocating for her daughter and others with \nspecial needs. She also sits on the Board of Amplify Life which is a nonprofit for \nchildren with special needs.  \n \nMs. Garland was not aware of ABLE accounts. After our conversation, she told \nme she had spoken with someone active in the special needs community and \nthey had just learned about the ABLE accounts by word-of-mouth. I thought it \nstriking with their level of involvement that these women active in the special \nneeds community had never heard of these accounts. It is apparent we are not \ngetting the word out about the ABLE Program. The move to the Treasurer's \nOffice would help spread the word as the Treasurer's Office has the budget for \noutreach. \n \nERIK JIMENEZ (Senior Policy Director, Nevada State Treasurer's Office): \nThe  ABLE  Act  was  one  of  the  largest  pieces  of  legislation  for  people  with \ndisabilities in this Country. Next to the Americans with Disabilities Act, the \nABLE Act is one of the single most monumental pieces of legislation for this \npopulation of folks who typically get left behind. \n \nThe beauty of the ABLE Program is that people who are typically twice as likely \nto be in poverty and unemployed are able to save and spend their money as \nthey wish. Right now, there are limits on how much money they can save \nwithout losing their social security and Medicaid benefits. The ABLE Act allows \nfor them to save and put their money in tax advantage savings accounts and \nspend it as they wish without losing access to those essential programs. It is \nimportant we allow people to get out of the cycle of poverty. Just because you \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 15, 2019 \nPage 4 \n \nwere born differently does not mean you should be held back. We believe the \nABLE Program is monumental in terms of helping these people get out of a bad \nsituation. \n \nRight now, we have 448 national accounts. We are in a State consortium of \n16 states; we have $2.18 million in assets under management with an average \naccount balance of $4,800. Nevada residents only account for approximately \n95  of  those  448  accounts.  Before  the  Treasurer  took  office  on \nJanuary 7, 2019, we only had 60 accounts. I would argue that we are doing \nwell  so  far  with  no  budget  or  legislative  authority  to  perform  outreach  and \nmarketing of this Program to get people signed up. We want to continue this \npriority.  \n \nThe last Treasurer, while well-intentioned on some issues, did not see this as a \npriority. We want to ensure every person with a disability has the opportunity to \nmove up, save and live their lives to the fullest. We are taking a similar level of \nengagement with our college savings programs. We will employ navigators, or \nuse those within our Office, to meet people within the communities to speak \nabout problems they may be experiencing or answer questions they have when \nit comes to losing benefits or lack thereof. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs Health and Human Services happy to see someone else take this and run with \nit as it removes the responsibility from the ADSD? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN COHEN: \nWe have Homa Woodrum, the Chief Advocacy Attorney for ADSD here today \nwho may be able to answer that question for you. My understanding is this is \nacceptable to them.  \n \nDEIDRE HAMMON: \nI am with the Center for Self Determination Library in Reno. We have a disability \nlibrary  run  by  our  librarian,  Brianna  Hammon.  We  support  a  People  First  of \nNevada group which is made up of individuals with developmental disabilities \nwho  are  engaged  in  self-advocacy  activities.  We  also  have  a  children's \nadvocacy  project  where  we  do  advocacy  for  children  in  schools  around \nIndividual Education Programs. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 15, 2019 \nPage 5 \n \nWhen this bill came about, People First was very excited about the idea of being \nable to save money, but we could not get certain questions answered. We \nheard  there  would  be  a  training  in  the  community  led  by  an  attorney  at  a \nnonprofit agency. They could not answer any of our questions. It would be nice \nto have someone from the Treasurer's Office that could answer our questions. \n \nBRIANNA HAMMON (Center for Self Determination Library): \nThe Center for Self Determination Library in Reno supports A.B. 130. \n \nHOMA  WOODRUM  (Chief  Advocacy  Attorney,  Aging  and  Disability  Services, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nAging and Disability Services is in support of A.B. 130. We will continue to do \nour outreach and education. We are anxious to see what the Treasurer's Office \nis able to do with funding for this program. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 130 and open the hearing on A.B. 147. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 147: Authorizes a physician assistant or advanced practice \nregistered nurse to perform certain services. (BDR 40-85) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN ROBIN L. TITUS (Assembly District No. 38): \nI am here today to present A.B. 147 for your consideration. \n \nA physician assistant (PA) and an advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) \nare  both  considered  medical  professionals;  both  are  also  considered  medical \nproviders. The professions have similarities and differences. I have provided a \nhandout  (Exhibit  C)  referencing  the  2018  Comparison  of  Nevada  PA,  Nurse \nPractitioners and Physician Education. \n \nThe key point to be made today is the difference in their licensure. Advanced \npractice registered nurses are licensed under the State Board of Nursing and \nPAs are licensed under the Board of Medical Examiners and State Board of \nOsteopathic  Medicine.  Physician  assistants  are  required  to  have  a  physician \nsupervisor and APRNs are no longer required to have a collaborating physician. \nThey  were  granted  independent  practice  in  2013  by  the  Nevada  State \nLegislature. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 15, 2019 \nPage 6 \n \nA  major  part  of  the  reasoning  for  their  independence,  in  addition  to  their \ntraining, was Nevada's lack of providers, especially in the rural areas and in the \narea of primary care. Unfortunately, the lack of providers was not solved. As \nNevada's  population  continued  to  grow,  the  ratio  of  medical  providers  to \npopulation  worsened.  The  projected  physician  shortage  nationwide  is \n90,000 providers in 2025 and increasing to approximately 105,000 by 2030. \nPrimary  care  is  one  of  the  areas  with  the  most  significant  shortfall.  The \nestimated shortfall in that area is between 7,800 and 32,000; there are just not \nenough of us. \n \nAs a family practice physician, I have trained and worked with both APRNs and \nPAs. I would not be here today without the dedication and skills of the PA in my \noffice  or  those  who  have  covered  for  me  in  past  sessions.  Although  I  am \navailable 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by phone, and in-house 3 days a week, \nthere are times when patients need documents that require my signature. Even \nthough APRNs are independent practitioners, and PAs can exercise autonomy \nand medical decision making, and have the training and knowledge to perform \nthe required exams, they cannot sign certain forms. This bill attempts to fix \nthat. To be clear, APRNs and PAs are not excluded from signing these forms. \nThey were not included when these forms were created, as they did not exist \nas an entity at the time. \n \nOne of the issues identified was the very nature of the professions. In 1864, \nwhen the Nevada Constitution and subsequent NRS were written, their practice \nmodels and professions did not exist. This bill alleviates some of the barriers to \ncare. It updates the statutes to be consistent with today's health care world \nwhile  protecting  patients.  Assembly  Bill  147  does  not  expand  the  scope  or \npractice for either profession. It does give them signature authority for exams \nthey are currently doing and allows them to practice to the full extent of their \ncapabilities. \n \nAs this bill has progressed, there have been no amendments. The bill states a \nprovider of health care or a physician assistant may refer a patient to a physical \ntherapist. A provider may also perform a physical exam, release a person to play \nsports and sign the post-injury form. \n \nThis bill will allow a PA to sign a form for a student to take their medications to \nschool. There are many rules and regulations that currently exist around what \nmedications a student may take to the classroom. This bill would allow the PA, \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 15, 2019 \nPage 7 \n \nwho has prescribed the medication, to sign the form allowing the student to \ntake the medication. \n \nAssembly Bill 147 will allow the PA to sign off on students to continue to \nparticipate in competitive sports within the school district. It will allow a PA, \nwithin the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid guidelines, certain signature rights \nand the ability to order home health care. It also allows a PA, who can currently \ndo Commercial Driver License physicals, to do taxicab physicals. This will also \nallow them to sign a handicap placard application. \n \nWe passed a bill for nurse practitioners last Session allowing them independent \npractice and the ability to sign some of these forms, but these forms were not \nchanged. This bill will also state the appropriate department that is affected by \nthis bill will be required to change their forms on or before January 1, 2020. \n \nWe did reach out to the individual departments, including the Department of \nMotor Vehicles (DMV), as they will be most affected with the signature for the \nhandicap placards. They assured us there would be no fiscal concerns, as it is \ndone by a computer and the change to the form that is downloaded could be \neasily done.  \n \nSENATOR WOODHOUSE: \nAfter reviewing this bill, and those that were brought forward last Session, I do \nnot know why we did not catch these issues at that time. I am happy we are \ndealing with this now, especially with respect to the PAs. They are a vital part \nof our medical community and dealing with health care for our citizens. \n \nJOAN HALL (Nevada Rural Hospital Partners Foundation): \nThis bill is similar to S.B. 134 we have this Session. It appears to me they are \nboth clean-up bills to S.B. No. 227 of the 79th Session. The bill simply ensures \nthe assessments APRNs and PAs can document on forms are allowed within the \nscope of their practice. These forms have historically had the word \"Physician\" \nunderneath the signature line. Since neither of these are physicians, they cannot \nsign the forms. During the Interim, we worked to try to get the various agencies \nto change their forms, and they stated they were not allowed to do so.  \n \nSENATE  BILL  134:  Makes  various  changes  relating  to  advanced  practice \nregistered nurses. (BDR 43-63) \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 15, 2019 \nPage 8 \n \nNevada Rural Hospital Partners Foundation members operate 16 health clinics in \nrural Nevada. There are often only PAs or APRNs in these areas. It is disruptive \nto patient care for these patients to see their providers, have their assessments \ncompleted and not be able to get their handicap placard or take a back-to-school \nform or to give their own insulin at school. As Assemblywoman Titus stated, \nphysicians are not always present, so making patients wait for a form to be \nsigned by a physician is not right. Nevada Rural Hospital Partners Foundation \nurges your support for A.B. 147. \n  \nMICHAEL HACKETT (Nevada Academy of Physician Assistants): \nNevada Academy of Physician Assistants supports A.B. 147. We are grateful \nfor the bipartisan support this bill received in the Assembly. As Assemblywoman \nTitus mentioned, this is one of several bills this Session designed to shed light \non the PA profession, the role they play in the delivery of our health care, and \nhow to fully utilize the education, skills, training and experience the PAs bring to \nour health care delivery system. \n \nWe recognize the challenges health care in Nevada faces, including professional \nwork force issues. Our members are committed to team-based delivery of health \ncare and feel this bill is a step forward in that direction.  \n \nCHLOE CHISM (Nevada Advanced Practice Nurses Association): \nNevada Advanced Practice Nurses Association supports A.B. 147. This bill fixes \nimplementation problems the industry has dealt with as a result of S.B. No. 227 \nof the 79th Session. \n \nPAIGE BARNES (Nevada Nurses Association): \nNevada Nurses Association supports A.B. 147. This bill will provide APRNs with \ngreater signing authority within their scope of practice. This will give patients \nbetter access to care across the State. \n \nMARI NAKASHIMA (Nevada State Medical Association): \nNevada State Medical Association supports A.B. 147. As was stated, this bill \ndoes  not  expand  the  scope  of  practice.  It  keeps  supervision  intact  for \nconsultation, which is an important patient protection. Physician assistants are \nrequired  to  follow  the  standard  of  care;  we  support  this  provision  as  a \ncontinuing clean-up measure. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 15, 2019 \nPage 9 \n \nRYAN BEAMAN: \nI am the parent of a child involved in high school activities. I am in support of \nA.B. 147. We have gone through the process of getting the sign-off on the form \nfor an injury in order to return to playing sports. This is not an easy process if \nyour primary care is with a PA. Trying to find a physician to see you in a short \nperiod of time is not easy.  \n \nAPRIL SANBORN (Services Manager III, Driver Programs, Nevada Department of \nMotor Vehicles): \nThe DMV confirms Assemblywoman Titus' testimony that there will be no fiscal \nimpact to the DMV. As with the addition of the ARPNs during the last Session, \nit will be a procedural change and an easy addition to our forms.  \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN TITUS: \nWe have worked several sessions on some of these clean-up bills and believe \nwe have it right this time. Health care is a moving target, things come up and \nthere is a lot to work on. This bill does give us a step forward in the right \ndirection. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 147. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRemainder of page intentionally left blank; signature page to follow.   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 15, 2019 \nPage 10 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSeeing no further business, the meeting is adjourned at 4:13 p.m. \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nVickie Polzien, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 15, 2019 \nPage 11 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nExhibit / \nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \n# of pages \n  A  1    Agenda \n  B  3    Attendance Roster \nAssemblywoman Robin L.

TITUS (Assembly District No. 38): \nThe last Session, it was decided to divide the behavioral policy boards of our \nState into four quadrants. This was done to recognize the distinct and different \nissues in regard to mental health, and it was felt they would best be addressed \non  a  regional  basis.  I  am  the  Legislator  appointed  to  the  Northern  Regional \nBehavioral Health Policy Board (NRBHPB). \n \nAssembly Bill 85 was created from the NRBHPB after many months and many \nhearings. This bill addresses issues regarding persons in a mental health crisis, \ntheir legal rights and the formation of what is called the \"Legal 2000\" or a \n\"mental health hold\".   \n \nKAREN BECKERBAUER (Northern Regional Behavioral Health Policy Board): \nI am the Vice Chair of the NRBHPB, representing the Social Services Section. \nWe are a diverse group that represents a wide region of our State and we \ncollectively  agreed  to  put  our  efforts  toward  refining  the  psychiatric  hold \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 24, 2019 \nPage 4 \n \nprocess,  known  today  as  the  Legal  2000.  We  received  training  and  heard \ntestimony  from  stakeholders:  patients,  family  members,  emergency  room \npersonnel,  law  enforcement,  attorneys,  firefighters,  paramedics,  behavioral \nhealth providers, physicians, elected officials and many more.  \n \nWe learned the existing laws are interpreted differently by many of the involved \npersonnel. The appropriate reason for a hold, the time frame of the 72-hour \nwindow, the reason and process for extending the hold and other details were \nidentified  as  needing  some  clarification  that  all  parties  could  agree  on  and \nimplement. \n \nThe one thing we all agreed on was the focus should be on the patient. We \nneeded  to  transform  the  dialogue  from  a  Legal  2000  process  to  that  of  a \nbehavioral  health  protection  hold.  The  NRBHPB  recognized  this  was  a  big \nundertaking  and  we  asked  Jessica  Flood  to  create  a  Statewide  Legal  Hold \nWorkgroup to hear everyone's concerns and input. That workgroup consisted of \nover 60 individuals (Exhibit D) involved in the system. They met every week. \nJessica Flood provided the NRBHPB monthly updates on the progress of the \nworkgroup and took our questions and concerns back to that workgroup. This \nStatewide Legal Hold Workgroup was a great example of all interested parties \nfrom across the State coming together for a common purpose. In the end, the \nNRBHPB agreed unanimously to come forward with this bill in support of a more \nperson-centered and uniformly interpretive process for behavioral health holds.  \n \nJESSICA FLOOD (Northern Regional Behavioral Health Policy Board): \nI am the Northern Regional Behavioral Health Coordinator. The NRBHPB bill, \nA.B.  85,  is  focused  on  updating  and  clarifying  NRS  433A  which  details \nNevada's mental health crisis hold process.   \n \nFirst, I would like to review the document titled Nevada's Mental Health Crises \nHold (Exhibit E) to provide an overview of the current process described in law. \nThen I will present the seven major changes that A.B. 85 proposed to make in \nNRS 433A. \n \nThe hold process, Exhibit E, starts when a patient is deemed to be a danger to \nself or others, or is gravely disabled, and is detained by law enforcement or \nhealthcare professionals. If they are not already in the hospital, the patient will \nbe transported to one. There, a healthcare professional will carry out a medical \nclearance process to determine if they are medically stable, and certify the hold \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 24, 2019 \nPage 5 \n \nthrough testing the mental illness as part of the patient's risk to harm self or \nothers, or grave disability.  \n \nOnly after this process occurs, does the 72-hour time period start, even though \nthe person has already been detained for an undefined amount of time prior. The \nprior detention could have lasted a few minutes to up to a few days. This \nmeans if you are on a mental health crisis hold and you ask when the hold is \ndue to end, medical staff may tell you that the 72-hours may not start until \ntomorrow. That is when your labs come back and the doctor signs off on the \nmedical clearance.  \n \nWe have also included a second page of Exhibit E that depicts the court petition \nprocess that is initiated on the day the 72-hour period ends. \n \nBeing placed on a mental health crisis hold is one of the most extreme losses of \nliberty in our society. It is only surpassed by being arrested. When an individual \nis placed on a hold, they lose their right to leave the scene, vehicle or healthcare \nsetting. They often lose access to most of their personal items and possessions.  \n \nOnce  at  the  healthcare  facility,  they  are  personally  monitored  and  often \nrestricted in day-to-day actions that we take for granted, such as getting food, \nusing the restroom and using the phone. It is important to note that individuals \nwho are placed on hold are not those \"other\" people who have a mental illness. \nI was a social worker who previously worked at the Mallory Crisis Center at \nCarson Tahoe Hospital in an inpatient psychiatric unit. I can tell you the people \nwho come in on mental health crisis holds are people like you and me. I have \nseen police officers, engineers, nurses, college students and others who are \ncontributing community members. They are just experiencing an unfortunate \ncircumstance.  \n \nWhile  mental  health  crisis  holds  are  a  necessary  mechanism  to  protect \nindividuals at risk of harm or death due to mental illness, the process in Nevada \nis opaque and practiced differently from county to county. In any hospital in \nNevada, a patient can be placed on a hold and not receive clear information on \nthe process they are experiencing, including how long they will be detained. \nAdditionally, in 15 out of 17 counties in Nevada there was not a court petition \nprocess in place that aligned with current law, and 14 of the 17 counties did \nnot even have a process in place.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 24, 2019 \nPage 6 \n \nAssembly Bill 85 focuses on clarifying and standardizing the mental health crisis \nprocess so the NRBHPB can develop standardized education for every patient on \na hold in a hospital, emergency room or inpatient psychiatric facility to receive \nand to understand their rights and due process. The standardization will also \nallow us to work with the rural counties to develop a mental health crisis hold \npetition process that is aligned with Nevada law.  \n \nI will now discuss the seven major changes (Exhibit F) proposed in A.B. 85. I \nwill present them by priority rather than numerical order. The first major change \nwill be in sections 9 and 10. This will clarify that the 72-hour detainment starts \nwhen any section of the hold is completed.  \n \nAs depicted in Exhibit E, counties and providers currently interpret the 72-hour \nclock  to  start  at  the  initiation  of  the  hold  or  after  medical  clearance  and \ncertification. In many counties, one could say that because of the time it takes \nto carry out the medical clearance and certification, Nevada has a 72-hour plus \nhold. This can cause much confusion to healthcare providers attempting to refer \npatients  to  other  counties,  and  causes  a  lot  of  confusion  for  patients  and \nfamilies as well.  \n \nWe  understand  it  is  the  providers'  responsibility  to  carry  out  the  medical \nclearance and certification to deem the mental health crisis hold valid; however, \nwe also see the 72-hour time period in which a person's liberty is restricted as a \nparallel process. This allows the courts to have oversight if the patient needs to \nbe held beyond 72 hours. This ensures consistent and timely court oversight \nthat is transparent to all parties and allows the patient to access the right to \ncounsel.  \n \nThe second change is in section 7 of the bill. It proposes to remove stigma and \nupdate language and criteria for the existing term, \"person with mental illness\". \nIn current law, \"a person with mental illness\" means any person who, as a \nresult of the mental illness, is a danger to self or others. This is not an accurate \ndefinition of mental illness and is stigmatizing for anyone who may experience \nmental illness.  \n \nAssembly Bill 85 proposes to update the term \"person with mental illness\" to \n\"person in a mental health crisis\". This term means any person whose capacity \nto exercise self-control, judgement and discretion in the conduct of the person's \naffairs and social relations or to care for his or her personal needs is diminished, \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 24, 2019 \nPage 7 \n \nas  a  result  of  the  mental  illness,  to  the  extent  that  the  person  presents  a \n\"substantial likelihood of serious harm\" to himself or herself or others.  \n \nSection 4 of A.B. 85 also updates the language of the criteria of mental health \ncrisis hold in line with national recommendations from the Treatment Advocacy \nCenter.  \n \nIt is important to note we did not have any intention of either expanding or \nlimiting  the  current  criteria.  We  worked  closely  with  all  partners,  including \nhospitals and law enforcement to ensure this was the case. \n \nThe third major change is in section 19 of the bill, which focuses on improving \nthe efficiency of the court process. Assembly Bill 85 extends the time for a \ncourt to set the hearing for court-ordered admission by one judicial day. This \nallows the courts to calendar all petitions on one specific day a week providing \ngreater organization and transparency through regularly held court hearings and \nreducing court costs.  \n \nAssembly Bill 85 also codifies the current practice of stipulated continuances \nwhich allows the patient to agree to treatment with court oversight without the \nneed  for  a  commitment.  This  increases  the  court's  flexibility  to  address  an \nindividual's needs for brief treatment without being committed and reduces the \nneed for court hearings.  \n \nThe fourth major change is in sections 14, 25 and 28 of the bill. This addresses \ninformation  sharing  to  enhance  coordination  and  continuity  of  care. \nAssembly Bill 85 clarifies NRS 433A to align with information sharing guidelines \nprescribed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). \nThe bill also strengthens care coordination in line with federal HIPAA guidelines \nby  ensuring  that  individuals  in  a  mental  health  crisis  hold  are  asked  within \n24 hours of admission to a mental health facility if they would like notice to be \nprovided to anyone. The bill also removes the mandate that spouses be notified, \nas there are cases where such notification would not be appropriate and may \neven be harmful.  \n \nA mandate was also included that information be shared with a durable power \nof attorney for health care, which may be identified in a psychiatric advanced \ndirective. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 24, 2019 \nPage 8 \n \nThe  bill  updates  the  types  of  authorized  notification  regarding  emergency \nadmissions.  \n \nThe changes also allow for limited information sharing by courts with providers \nfor  the  purposes  of  continuity  of  care,  as  the  courts  often  repeatedly  see \npatients  in  a  chronic  crisis  and  see  providers  re-creating  and  duplicating \ntreatment plans. This would allow for courts to support care coordination and \nreduce repeated treatment efforts.  \n \nThe fifth change is focused on behavioral health transport. Assembly Bill 85 \nproposes to use accredited agents which already exist in law as a mechanism \nfor behavioral health transport.  \n \nIn  current  law,  an  accredited  agent  has  the  ability  to  detain  and  transport \nindividuals on mental health crisis holds. The bill takes away the agent's ability \nto detain someone, which essentially leaves behind a behavioral health transport \noption. Medicaid has stated their intention to create a reimbursable provider for \nbehavioral  health  transport  and  has  identified  using  accredited  agents  as  a \nmechanism to do so.  \n \nAssembly Bill 85 removes the restriction that an individual be accompanied by \nat  least  one  attendant  of  the  same  sex  or  a  relative  of  an  individual  being \ntransported  by  a  member  of  the  opposite  sex.  This  was  removed  as \nstakeholders  from  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  (DHHS) \nbelieve they can address this concern through training, thus allowing for greater \nflexibility for transportation.  \n \nThe sixth change in A.B. 85 is found in section 22 of the bill. This requires \nhospitals release a person within 24 hours after the court has determined the \nperson does not meet criteria for civil commitment unless the person remains at \nthe facility or hospital voluntarily. In current law, there is no time frame to \nrelease  an  individual.  Stakeholders  from  courts  and  hospitals  agreed  that \n24 hours would be a sufficient time to develop an adequate discharge plan for \nthe individual to be released.  \n \nThe seventh change provides the State Board of Health with the ability to adopt \nregulations for the following issues.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 24, 2019 \nPage 9 \n \nFirst,  Nevada  currently  has  no  guidelines  for  involuntary  administration  of \nmedication.  With  no  Statewide  guidelines,  hospitals  need  legal  counsel  to \nunderstand the process based on court law. Many new hospitals do not have \nthis  ability.  By  creating  regulations,  hospitals  and  stakeholders  will  have  a \ncentral place for the information.  \n \nThe  State  Board  of  Health  will  develop  regulations  for  hospital  reporting  of \nmental health crisis holds. This was unanimously supported by stakeholders on \nthe Statewide Legal Hold Workgroup as they all see the need for data and \ninsight into community needs. They also believe this data will inform Nevada on \ngaps and needs of underserved populations such as youth and veterans.   \n \nSecond, A.B. 85 provides the State Board of Health with the ability to develop \nregulations  for  discharge  planning  from  public  and  private  mental  health \nfacilities. Discharge planning has been a high priority for all regions in Nevada \nfor several years. This allows for the State to partner with psychiatric hospitals \nto develop strong discharge planning processes to support continuity of care.  \n \nThird,  the  bill  directs  the  State  Board  of  Health  to  develop  regulations  for \naccredited agents as I discussed before in the changes to behavioral health \ntransport. \n \nFourth,  the  bill  directs  the  State  Board  of  Health  to  define  the  process  for \nmedical clearance. As mentioned earlier, the term \"medical clearance\" is widely \ninterpreted across the State, leading to confusion for practitioners, patients and \nfamilies.  \n \nThe  last  part  of  Assembly  Bill  85  contains  some  minor  changes  such  as \nstandardizing the 72-hour clock in different situations for clarity and conformity.  \n \nIn  conclusion,  A.B.  85  is  primarily  focused  on  enhancing  patient  rights  by \nclarifying processes, and reducing provider confusion and potential trauma for \nthe patient. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration \n(SAMHSA)  just  released  a  report  on  civil  commitments  and  highlighted  four \nethical  principles  of  patient  care:  respect  for  autonomy,  non-malfeasance, \nbeneficence and justice. The report emphasizes relevant information be clearly \ncommunicated  to  the  patient  about  commitment  status,  purpose  evaluation, \netc.,  and  that  information  is  shared  with  supportive  family  members  and/or \nsignificant others, consistent with the patient's wishes. The SAMHSA really \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 24, 2019 \nPage 10 \n \nemphasizes  the  need  to  share  information  with  the  patient  and  have  a \ntransparent  process.  They  also  emphasize  that  due  process  protections  are \nunderstood and employed at every level for the person.  \n \nWe believe the changes made in A.B. 85 take major steps toward aligning our \nState with national recommendations. The Statewide Legal Hold Workgroup and \nthe NRBHPB realize there is much more work to be done, but see this as an \ninitial step toward a greater overhaul of our mental health crisis system. The \nStatewide Legal Hold Workgroup intend to continue working to provide more \nsubstantial updates to our system in the next Legislative Session.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nFrom your presentation, we learned you can have a mental health crisis without \na mental illness. Do we need the specific definition \"mental illness\" as spelled \nout in section 7? There may be someone who lacks capacity and does not fit \nthat definition. \n \nMS. FLOOD: \nMental  illness  is  the  criteria  necessary  for  involuntary  commitment  into  an \ninpatient  psychiatric  facility.  The  national  recommendation  is  you  do  not \nseparate criteria for emergency admission and an inpatient psychiatric facility. \nThe Nevada Psychiatric Association advocated that mental illness is the key \ncriteria in order to hold someone. Law enforcement will place someone on a \nhold with the presumption they have a mental illness and then it is checked out \nby a provider.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI am thinking of the person whose wife was just murdered by his best friend \nand he says \"I want to kill that guy.\" Does the husband have a mental illness or \ndoes he want to harm someone else and we want to put him in a safe situation? \n \nMS. FLOOD: \nI am not a psychiatrist, but I could say that someone could diagnose that person \nwith an adjustment disorder.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nAll  of  those  things  have  criteria  that  you  have  to  meet  in  order  to  get  a \ndiagnosis of an adjustment disorder. It is not something that is a five minute \nthing.  I  hear  what  you  are  saying  and  you  are  contradicting  what  you  are \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 24, 2019 \nPage 11 \n \nsaying. I do not think you have to have a mental illness in order to have a \nmental health crisis.  \n \nMS. FLOOD: \nI surveyed all 50 states and they all have the criteria \"mental illness\" as their \ncriteria. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nNevada could be number one.  \n \nMS. FLOOD: \nThe  Statewide  Legal  Hold  Workgroup  is  planning  to  overhaul  the  legal  hold \nlanguage in the next two years. It needs to be re-written and that is an issue we \ncould tackle in the future. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs anyone here in support of A.B. 85? \n \nSARAH ADLER (National Alliance on Mental Illness): \nWe  are  in  support  of  A.B.  85.  It  is  a  large  bill  that  bravely  and  with  care \naddresses  many  components  of  a  mental  health  crisis  that  have  such  deep \neffects on the individual and their family.  It is respectful and has a systematic \noutcome.  \n \nMR. SPRATLEY: \nThe Nevada Sheriffs' and Chiefs' Association is in support of A.B. 85. \n \nJOAN HALL (Nevada Rural Hospital Partners Foundation): \nI would like to add, Ms. Flood is employed by Nevada Rural Hospital Partners. \nThis bill is vitally important in our minds. It benefits individuals in a mental \nhealth  crisis  and  their  family  members.  It  benefits  law  enforcement  and \nemergency personnel. It benefits health providers and the judicial system.  \n \nKENDRA BERTSCHY (Washoe County Public Defender's Office): \nMy office was a part of the Statewide Legal Hold Workgroup, and we represent \nindividuals  in  the  NRS  433A  civil  and  voluntary  commitment  hearings.  We \nbelieve this provides necessary clarification, as well as consistency to Statewide \nlaws. We agree the judicial oversight is necessary, because we are dealing with \na liberty restriction and appreciate the clarification of access to representation.   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 24, 2019 \nPage 12 \n \nJOHN PIRO (Clark County Public Defenders Office): \nWe agree with the comments of the Washoe County Public Defender's Office. \nWe support A.B. 85. \n \nSARA CHOLHAGIAN (Dignity Health - St. Rose Dominican Neighborhood Hospitals): \nWe are in support of A.B. 85. We have submitted testimony (Exhibit G). Dignity \nHealth has participated in the Statewide Legal Hold Workgroup of the NRBHPB.  \n \nJOELLE GUTMAN (Washoe County Health District): \nWe are in support of A.B. 85. One of our district priorities is working with the \ncommunity to improve mental health and destigmatization is a big part of that.   \n \nANDRES MOSES (Eighth Judicial District Court – Clark County): \nWe have support testimony (Exhibit H) submitted by Bita Yeager, the Hearing \nMaster. We are in support of A.B. 85. \n \nMICHAEL  HACKETT  (Nevada  Primary  Care  Association;  Nevada  Public  Health \nAssociation): \nI am here on behalf of both organizations, and we are in support of A.B. 85.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will note this Committee has had hearings in regard to the Legal 2000 hold \nprocess. These hearings are often contentious and have many folks on different \nsides of the issue. On behalf of the Committee on Health and Human Services I \nwant  to  commend  the  work  done  on  this  issue.  Do  you  have  any  closing \ncomments? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN TITUS: \nI have also been a witness to many hearings on the Legal 2000 hold process. It \nis an honor for me to be this far along in the process of resolving some of the \nissues. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 85, and open the hearing on A.B. 169. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 169 (1st Reprint): Establishes the Maternal Mortality Review \nCommittee. (BDR 40-712) \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 24, 2019 \nPage 13 \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN DANIELE MONROE-MORENO (Assembly District No. 1):  \nThis bill establishes the Maternal Mortality Review Committee (MMRC) within \nthe DHHS. Why is this important? Pregnancy related deaths have doubled in the \nUnited  States  over  the  past  25  years.  An  estimated  700  women  die  of \npregnancy  related  causes  each  year  in  the  United  States  and  another \n65,000 women have serious health complications. The United States is the only \nhigh resource country with a rising maternal mortality rate. Nearly half of all \nthese deaths are believed to be preventable. There is also a significant and \nwidening disparity among black women in our Country. Creating the MMRC is \nan important step in identifying programs, treatments and protocols to prevent \npoor health outcomes for Nevada mothers. Currently, Nevada is one of seven \nstates without an MMRC.   \n \nMS. O'MARA: \nI have prepared a slide presentation (Exhibit I). I want to make an update to \npage 4. Governor Brad Little signed a bill on March 21, 2019 which established \nan MMRC in the state of Idaho. Assembly Bill 169 establishes the MMRC. The \nDirector of DHHS will appoint between 6 and 12 members to the MMRC and \ncriteria is laid out on page 5 of Exhibit I or section 6, subsection 2 of the bill.  \n \nThe MMRC responsibilities are laid out on page 6 of Exhibit I or section 7 of the \nbill. I will highlight the main responsibilities. The MMRC will identify and review \nincidences of maternal mortality, which is when the woman dies within one year \nof the birth of the baby. The MMRC will also look at severe maternal morbidity, \nwhich is a strong complication arising from the birth, but does not lead to death.  \n \nThe MMRC will examine a number of documents which are contained in the bill, \nand will generate reports on or before April 1 of each year and on December 31 \nin the year leading up to the Legislative Session.  \n \nThere are three main things that we think will be helpful both to the Legislature \nand  the  state  of  public  health  in  Nevada  and  that  is  found  in  section  7, \nsubsection 1, paragraph (f), subparagraphs (1) through (3).  \n \nSubparagraph (1) is a description of the incidents of maternal mortality and \nsevere maternal morbidity in the immediate 24 months in a manner that does \nnot allow for the identification of any one person. This is de-identified data that \nwill encompass the occurrences within the last two years. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 24, 2019 \nPage 14 \n \nSubparagraph  (2)  entails  plans  for  corrective  action;  how  we  can  reduce \nmaternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity in Nevada. \n \nSubparagraph (3) is any possible recommendations either through legislation or \nother changes in policy that can help us address this problem.  \n \nThe MMRC is going to make specific data-driven recommendations to help us \ndetermine how we need to improve public health for our women in Nevada.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI am looking at the fiscal note, which is zero. I know this is not a money \ncommittee, but it is my understanding the fiscal note is zero because there is an \nopportunity to receive a grant. \n \nMS. O'MARA: \nWe  do  believe  by  working  with  DHHS  there  were  some  existing  resources \navailable to allow for the zero amount. However, the real reason we are trying \nto work as quickly as possible is if this bill is passed and signed by May 8, then \nNevada would qualify for this year's federal grant dollars.  \n \nI forgot to include in my presentation there is a new federal law that would \nsupport Nevada's efforts. It is called H.R.1318 - Preventing Maternal Deaths \nAct of 2018. This act creates grants to states that develop an MMRC.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs there anyone in support of A.B. 169? \n \nSANDRA KOCH (The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology): \nI  am  also  an  Ob-Gyn  here  in  Carson  City  submitting  testimony  (Exhibit  J), \nThe American  College  of  Obstetricians  and  Gynecologists  letter  of  support \n(Exhibit K) and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists letter \nof  support  (Exhibit L).  This  has  long  been  an  issue  we  have  worked  on  in \nNevada. The DHHS has provided a lot of background work. What has been \nmissing  is  our  ability  to  look  carefully  at  the  records  in  each  one  of  these \ndeaths.  We  have  not  been  able  to  do  this  because  we  have  not  had  legal \nprotection to make sure that information does not become public. The creation \nof the MMRC will allow us to do that.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 24, 2019 \nPage 15 \n \nWe do not have many deaths in Nevada; however, the other important issue is \nthe maternal morbidity. We want to collect that data. Maternal deaths are the \ntip of the iceberg, but we want to look at the iceberg too. That information is \navailable because discharge data is submitted by Nevada. We will be gleaning \nthis  data  for  the  18  codes  that  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  has \nrecommended.  I  know  we  will  qualify  for  federal  funds  and  this  is  a  great \nopportunity for Nevada.  \n \nMOLLY ROSE LEWIS (NARAL Pro-Choice Nevada): \nApproximately  45,000  members  and  I  support  A.B.  169;  we  have  support \ntestimony (Exhibit M). \n \nMS. GUTMAN: \nThe Washoe County Health District is here in support of A.B. 169. Pregnancy \nrelated  mortality  is  on  the  increase,  particularly  in  our  women  of  color, \nminorities and low income. The establishment of the MMRC is a critical step to \neffect meaningful change. About five years ago, the Washoe County Health \nDistrict established the Fetal Infant Mortality Review (FIMR) program and this \nhas proven valuable to the State. The FIMR data has driven such projects as the \nStatewide  campaign,  Go  Before  You  Show,  which  encourages  newly \nimpregnated women to seek out early prenatal care so they can have the best \nchance possible for a successful and healthy pregnancy. Building on the success \nof the FIMR program, the MMRC would be able to disseminate the findings of \nthis review process to healthcare providers, hospitals and the public to increase \nawareness of danger signs and improve access and delivery of health care.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWhat are the severe morbidities Nevada will be looking at? Is this a para needle \ntear?  \n \nMS. KOCH: \nIt would be pulmonary embolism, severe maternal hemorrhage, seizures, severe \nhypertension, stroke or cardiac problems. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThese conditions would not be a headache or an easy sprain? \n \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 24, 2019 \nPage 16 \n \nMS. KOCH: \nNo they would not. I will supply you with the list of the 18 conditions. They are \nall catastrophic and near death. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIt would be good to have that list for the record. \n \nMS. KOCH: \nI would be happy to get that to you. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIf you could distribute that to the full Committee, that would be appreciated. \n \nCECELIA LAMPLEY: \nMy grandmother died almost 90 years ago from childbirth. It is incredible to me \nthat 90 years later women are still dying from childbirth. It seems like a tragedy. \nI know the outcome, because I know how it impacted my mother being raised \nby someone who was not her mother. I am a mental health counselor and I have \nseen the impact for children who lose their mothers. I support A.B. 169. \n \nMARLENE LOCKARD (Nevada Women's Lobby): \nWe support A.B. 169 and think it will go a long way to provide information and \nmake health changes as necessary. \n \nELISA CAFFERATA (Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada): \nWe  support  this  program  on  behalf  of  our  16,000  patients  and  activists \n(Exhibit N). \n \nMELISSA CLEMENT (Nevada Right to Life): \nWe are in favor of A.B. 169.  \n \nSERENA EVANS (Nevada Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual Violence):  \nI did submit testimony (Exhibit O). One thing I did want to point out, pregnant \nindividuals  experiencing  domestic  violence  have  a  37  percent  higher  risk  of \nobstetric complications that have lethal outcomes for both the patient and baby.  \n \nMR. HACKETT: \nI am here on behalf of the Nevada Primary Care Association and the Nevada \nPublic Health Association. Both organizations are in support of A.B. 169. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 24, 2019 \nPage 17 \n \nJARED BUSKER (Children's Advocacy Alliance): \nWe are in support of A.B. 169. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDoes the sponsor have any closing comments? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN MONROE-MORENO: \nWe do have the list of the 18 morbidity conditions. \n \nMS. O'MARA: \nThis  is  coming  from  the  Severe  Maternal  Morbidity  Nevada,  2016  Report \n(Exhibit P) from the Office of Analytics, DHHS. The relevant list is on page 9. \nDo you wish for me to read them or submit them for the record? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nPlease submit them for the record. Due to the time constraints of the grant, I \nwould like to take a motion. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN MOVED TO DO PASS A.B. 169. \n \nSENATOR HARDY SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.  \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 169 and open the work session on A.B. 130. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 130: Places the Nevada ABLE Savings Program entirely under \nthe authority of the State Treasurer.

(BDR 38-862) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN JILL TOLLES (Assembly District No. 25): \nIt has been a pleasure to work with the Nevada Institute for Children's Research \nand Policy and the Children's Advocacy Alliance. They came to me over the \nInterim and asked me to sponsor a bill to add a board member to the Nevada \nEarly Childhood Advisory Council (ECAC) and include a reporting requirement to \nbenefit the Legislature.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 24, 2019 \nPage 19 \n \nMR. BUSKER: \nThe purpose of A.B. 194 is to expand the capacity of the existing ECAC to \nestablish a comprehensive system ensuring the healthy development of children \nages zero to eight. The ECAC was created by Executive Order by the Governor \nin 2009 and continued by Executive Order in 2011 as a condition of the federal \nHead Start Act. In 2013, the Nevada Legislature passed A.B. No. 79 of the \n77th Session which established the ECAC in NRS.  \n \nThe  purpose  of  the  ECAC  is  to  strengthen  State  level  coordination  and \ncollaboration among various sectors in  settings of early childhood education \nprograms. It also conducts periodic Statewide assessments of needs relating to \nquality and availability of programs and services for children who are in early \nchildhood education programs. Lastly, ECAC identifies opportunities for, and \nbarriers to, early childhood education programs funded in whole or in part by \nfederal, State or local government.  \n \nIt  is  important  to  know  that  early  childhood  education  is  comprised  of  a \ncomprehensive network of systems. It encompasses not only education and \nacademic  needs  for  young  children,  but  includes  social  and  emotional \ndevelopment, mental and behavioral health and physical health.  \n \nAssembly  Bill  194  is  needed  to  ensure  that  all  of  these  components  are \nrepresented  on  the  ECAC.  The  ECAC  structure  was  established  utilizing \nguidance from the National Early Childhood Systems Working Group and the \nInstitute  of  Medicine  Report,  Transforming  the  Workforce  for  Children  Birth \nThrough Age 8: A Unifying Foundation.  Both of these resources called for \ncollaboration  between  primary  sectors  that  support  young  children.  Those \nsectors are education, community and social services and the third is health.  \n \nIn order to build an early childhood system in Nevada, representation from the \nhealth  sector  is  needed.  Therefore,  as  outlined  in  section  1,  subsection  1, \nparagraph (I) of A.B. 194, we are requesting an additional member who is a \nrepresentative  of  the  pediatric,  mental,  physical  or  behavioral  healthcare \nindustry. In section 1, subsection 3 of A.B. 194 is a requirement for ECAC to \nsubmit annual reports of outlined activities, as well as recommendations for \nimprovements to Nevada's early childhood education system.   \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 24, 2019 \nPage 20 \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nWe  have  done  a  number  of  things  that  seem  to  interface  with  this  bill. \nSenate Bill 203 establishes requirements for programs for children who are deaf \nand blind. This applies to early childhood. Is there a way to interface them? We \nalso passed another bill that is in the Assembly that looks at Star Ratings for \nschools.  \n \nSENATE BILL 203: Revises provisions governing programs for children who are \nblind, visually impaired, deaf or hard of hearing. (BDR 38-77) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN TOLLES: \nIt is my understanding ECAC wants to include a representative of pediatric, \nmental, physical and behavioral health on this board for the purpose of making \nrecommendations that tie to education. I think the point you made is excellent, \nbecause  you  are  right,  the  fact  that  we  have  lacked  somebody  who  has  a \nbackground  in  medical  health  has  been  a  deficit  for  ECAC.  By  having  that \nindividual there, they can advise how health connects to academic performance \nand outcomes, and make sure we are making recommendations so that those \nneeds are being met. I do believe there is a piece that will tie into those other \nbills that you mentioned.  \n \nMR. BUSKER: \nWe are looking Statewide for ways we can increase capacity for children with \nspecial  needs.  Currently,  we  do  not  have  that  capacity.  The  Children's \nAdvocacy Alliance does not sit on the ECAC, but we work closely with them. \nWe are committed to address the overall capacity that we have.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs  there  any  further  support  or  discussion?  Seeing  none,  I  will  entertain  a \nmotion.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY MOVED TO DO PASS A.B. 194. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 24, 2019 \nPage 21 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe will close the hearing on A.B. 194. Is there anyone here that would like to \npresent public comment? \n \nMS. ADLER: \nI  am  here  on  behalf  of  the  Nevada  Coalition  to  End  Domestic  and  Sexual \nViolence. It is an honor to end this day, Denim Day, Sexual Assault Awareness \nDay, here at the Senate Committee for Health and Human Services. I have seen \nmore people in this room wearing denim than any other room at the Legislature. \nI think this reflects the awareness of this Committee to stand up to sexual \nassault.  \n \nI  want  to  honor  and  recognize  Senator  Spearman  for  introducing S.B.  368, \nwhich is a Victim Rights bill. It is one of many pieces of legislation that is \nworking to make the world better for victims of sexual assault.  \n \nSENATE  BILL  368:  Revises  provisions  relating  to  protections  for  victims  of \ncrime.

(BDR 51-1073) \n \nMS. COMLOSSY: \nI  will  read  a  summary  of  the  bill  (Exhibit  D),  and  there  is  a  conceptual \namendment  (Exhibit E)  which  has  just  been  introduced  by  Senator  David  R. \nParks. Would it be alright to have the sponsors go over the amendment? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 11, 2019 \nPage 3 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nYes, I would prefer to have the sponsors of S.B. 418 come forward and discuss \nthe amendment. We are not reopening the hearing. We just want to make sure \nwe understand the amendment. \n \nSENATOR JAMES OHRENSCHALL (Senatorial District No. 21): \nThe  amendment  to  S.B.  418,  Exhibit  E,  basically  incorporates  some \nrecommendations  proposed  by  the  Washoe  County  Health  District.  Their \nrecommendations  have  to  do  with  signage  wherever  raw  milk  is  sold.  It \nspecifies  there  should  be  at  least  one  sign  that  meets  the  requirements  of \nsection 2.  \n \nSection 2 requires signage within five feet of a separate raw milk refrigerator. \nThe signage must be conspicuous to the patrons of the establishment, and each \nsign must be no smaller than 8 1/2 inches by 11 inches in size. The sign must \ncontain a notice in boldface type, clearly legible, stating, \"There are health risks \nassociated  with  the  consumption  of  unpasteurized  milk.  According  to  the \nCenters  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention,  consumption  of  raw  milk  is \n150 times more likely to cause food-borne illness than pasteurized milk.\" Within \nthe sign, the letters in the words \"health warning\" must be written in no less \nthan 40-point type, and the letters and all other words in the sign must be \nwritten in no less than 30-point type. The bill also requires a warning label on \nraw milk containers and a separate refrigerator in retail establishments where \nraw milk is sold.  \n \nThe amendment does keep county milk commissions; however, the goal is to \nhave uniform oversight from the Department of Agriculture. Again, raw milk is \nlegal and the testing regulations are outlined in the Nevada Revised Statutes \n(NRS). \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI appreciate the amendment. It goes a long way to make raw milk safer. It is still \nraw milk, and I will not support this bill. I think the amendment does a great job \ntrying to warn people of the reality of raw milk, and I appreciate that.  \n \nSENATOR OHRENSCHALL: \nIf the bill does move forward, Senator Parks and I will make sure if there are \nsales at restaurants, there will be warning labels there too. There may need to \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 11, 2019 \nPage 4 \n \nbe a future amendment. We have agreed to this with the Washoe County Health \nDistrict and perhaps add a larger role for the health districts.  \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nI have voted for this in the past. I grew up drinking milk and milking cows. I \nthink the amendment is good. I want to read it further. I will need to hesitate \nnow  and  say  no  but  reserve  the  right  to  change  my  mind.  I  believe  it  is \nimportant  for  people  to  know  what  they  are  getting,  and  the  labels  are \nimportant. I want to see the other amendment.  \n \nSENATOR OHRENSCHALL: \nWe are still working on some language. In that language, we are creating an \nincreased roll for public health agencies and making sure there is labeling if \nrestaurants do serve raw milk.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI have a question about small herds in section 4. Are we only allowing small \nherds to create this milk; therefore, there will not be a significant volume of \ndistribution? Or will there be a large volume of distribution, and small herds is a \ndifferent issue altogether? \n \nSENATOR OHRENSCHALL: \nMy understanding is that section 4 would allow for both. It would allow for a \nraw milk dairy producer who wants to produce and sell to a retailer. It would \nalso  allow  for  herdshares.  An  example  of  a  herdshare  is  where  a  family \npurchases a herdshare of a dairy cow from a family farm. Then, that family will \nschedule times to go to the farm and pick up fresh milk. This is something that \nhas not been allowed in Nevada since 2013; section 4 would bring that back. \n \nSENATOR WOODHOUSE: \nI struggled with this one a bit. I am going to go ahead and support it today. I \nappreciate the work you have done with those who are supporting this measure \nand by making the rules tighter.  \n \nMy bottom line is raw milk be safe for the individuals who consume it. I think \nyou have made great progress. If there is anything more we can do to make \nsure this is good for everyone, especially our children, we want to make sure \nthat happens.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 11, 2019 \nPage 5 \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI agree with Senator Woodhouse.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI am anxious to see what the rest of the amendment will look like, but I will \nsupport it today.  \n  \nSENATOR  WOODHOUSE  MOVED  TO  AMEND  AND  DO  PASS  AS \nAMENDED S.B. 418. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED.

(BDR 38-974) \n \nMS. COMLOSSY: \nI will read a summary of the bill and the conceptual amendment from the work \nsession document (Exhibit H). \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI have a question about the ability for a family member to supplement. I believe \nthis is only possible if Nevada pursued a waiver, but it would not be possible in \nour existing system because of federal rules. I am not sure in the amendment if \nwe are saying we would only do that if we applied for the waiver, or if we \nwould try to do that in our current system. \n \nSENATOR JAMES A. SETTELMEYER (Senatorial District No. 17):  \nAs I understand it if Nevada included this in NRS then it would have the ability \nto get the waiver to accomplish this. If there is nothing in the NRS, then Nevada \ndoes not  have the  ability to  do this in a waiver. I  will defer to the  expert \nbecause this is a confusing subject.  \n \nDUANE  YOUNG  (Deputy  Administrator,  Division  of  Health  Care  Financing  and \nPolicy, Department of Health and Human Services): \nIn the language, we did find there is a Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) that \ndoes prohibit such payments. Coinsurance is a different issue. What we found \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 11, 2019 \nPage 7 \n \nafter consulting with our deputy attorney general (DAG), this is a payment that \nis above the Medicaid rate. There is no specification as to how that is done \nexcept inside the 1915 J Waiver. Our DAGs have weighed in and provided \nlanguage  to  Senator  Settelmeyer  that  basically  there  is  nothing  that  would \nprohibit it inside this model. If a recipient did choose to add their personal funds \nto  the  funds  given  to  them  through  the  State  1915  J Waiver  application \nprogram, then they could do that, and there is no federal statute to prohibit that \nfrom happening.  \n \nInside of the J Waiver State Plan option, there would be the ability for them to \npay and supplement with their own funds, and no federal statute would prohibit \nthat. Outside of that option, we cannot find any federal statute that would \nallow for that, but we do not have a mechanism currently within Medicaid to \nfacilitate that.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nNevada does not have a mechanism to facilitate this, but I do not think that \nanyone is asking us to facilitate it. They are just trying to make sure they are \nnot breaking any laws if they choose that option.  \n \nI am still unclear. If we pass this language, or even if we do not pass this \nlanguage, in the current state without the 1915 J Waiver, can someone who is \nreceiving skilled nursing, supplement with their own income or have a family \nmember supplement? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nA family member is a different option. There is nothing that prohibits that. There \nis no federal statute that implicitly disallows this; however, because this is a \nunique situation where someone is paying outside or above the rate, Medicaid \nhas no way to facilitate that. If that payment were to happen, it could hinder \ntheir welfare eligibility. It is as if they were paying extra money that may be \ntaken into account when they are made reeligible for Medicaid. If they have \nextra money to pay for services above and beyond what Medicaid is providing, \nthat  extra  income  may  be  taken  into  account  when  they  are  reeligible  for \nMedicaid and could put them in danger of not receiving Medicaid.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs there an issue with a family member? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 11, 2019 \nPage 8 \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nThat is a totally different option. I would have to have legal weigh in. I do not \nbelieve from our research and what we have presented today that any CFR \nconflicts  with  that.  It  would  not  affect  the  individual  recipient's  Medicaid \neligibility because it would not be counted amongst their income. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWhat  I  heard  you  say  is  even  if  we  do  not  pass  this  law,  people  through \nNevada's current  program either through a primary care association  or their \ninsurance  services  office,  can  choose  to  hand  $20  to  their  personal  care \nattendant, and there is nothing that prohibits that from happening. There is \nnothing from a Medicaid standpoint that prohibits that. Is that correct? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nYes, there is nothing from a Medicaid standpoint that we have found. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThis  amendment  makes  it  explicit  that  when  Nevada  applies  for  the \n1915 J Waiver; this would explicitly be allowed. Is that correct? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nYes it is. \n \nSENATOR  SPEARMAN  MOVED  TO  AMEND  AND  DO  PASS  AS \nAMENDED S.B. 446. \n \nSENATOR WOODHOUSE SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.  \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will open the work session on S.B. 457. \n \nSENATE BILL 457: Revises provisions relating to health care facilities.

(BDR 39-470) \n \nASSEMBLYMAN STEVE YEAGER (Assembly District No. 9): \nI would like to explain how we arrived at this bill. The bill was created on behalf \nof the Southern Nevada Behavioral Health Policy Board (SNBHPB). I chaired the \nSNBHPB  during  the  Interim.  If  you  want  to  see  the  final  report  from  the \nSNBHPB (Exhibit H), it is quite long and has a lot of exhibits, but it will give you \na rundown of what was done, what we talked about and who we heard from.  \n \nThrough the work done, I invited every member of the SNBHPB to submit two \nto three ideas for bills. We narrowed the ideas to six concepts. There was a \nvote and this brought about A.B. 76. It was not unanimous. Everyone supported \nthe concept, but there were other ideas that some members wanted more than \nthis one. Ultimately, everyone on the SNBHPB was appreciative of bringing this \nforward.  \n \nI will go over what A.B. 76 does on a high level. Section 1, subsection 2 allows \nthe Commission on Behavioral Health to employ an administrative assistant and \na data analyst to help the Regional Boards. The Regional Boards need additional \nsupport; they are tasked with all types of data collection. I had hoped to make \nthis a mandate, but we decided to make it permissive language. My hope would \nbe that the Commission could employ an administrative assistant and a data \nanalyst to support all four of the Regional Boards that currently exist and a fifth \nRegional Board if this version of the bill were to go forward.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 1, 2019 \nPage 6 \n \nSection 2, subsections 1-4, deals with how many Boards there are and which \ncounties are in which regions. We are on the second reprint of the bill, and there \nhave been several different proposals already this Session. There continues to \nbe discussions, as to how many regions and which counties go in which region.  \n \nThis  brings  me  to  Senator  Hardy's  amendment  (Exhibit  I)  that  has  a  good \namount of buy-in and I think is the proper way to structure the Regional Boards. \nI am going to ask the Committee to ignore what you have in front of you in \nsection 2 of the bill and have Senator Hardy explain his proposal.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nSenator  Goicoechea  brought  up  some  issues  he  had  with  the  structure  of \nRegional Boards, and he and I looked at maps. I want to refer you to Exhibit I \nand will follow the pages in order. The first page outlines the current law.  \n \nThe second page is a map of the regions as the bill was introduced. You see \nsome differences with Lincoln County. Lincoln County did not want to be with \nClark County, so they are with Esmeralda County and Nye County.  \n \nThe third page depicts a regional map proposed by the second reprint and you \nshould be able to see how problematic this proposal would be. This map is \ndifficult due to the roads to get from one place to the next, and there was no \nbuy-in from different stakeholders from far away.  \n \nThis led to page 4, which is an amendment we are suggesting. It requires five \nregions instead of four. We looked at roads and nexus to roads, and if you go \nalong the 38th parallel at the top of Clark County and extend it through the \nlower triangle of Nye County, you pick up Beatty and Pahrump. The Pahrump \nhospital sends their people to Clark County, so it was a natural thing to go to \nClark in that particular part of Nye County. Whereas in Tonopah, Mineral and \nEsmeralda, people go to the hospital in Mineral County. As of right now, most \nmembers agree with this proposed regional map. There are some in Nye County \nwho take exception and prefer not to have their county broken up. Recognizing \nthe flow of patients, it would be hard for southern Nye County to go to Mineral \nCounty. This is why we did this. This is the map. \n \nASSEMBLYMAN YEAGER: \nI want to talk about section 3, where the bill refers to some of the qualifications \nneeded for some of the Board appointments. Some of the rural Boards had \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 1, 2019 \nPage 7 \n \ndifficulty finding someone qualified to be appointed to the Board, under the \nstatute as written. You will see some changes in qualifications. At the bottom \nof page 4, on line 40, we indicated that a member could be appointed who has \nreceived  behavioral  health  services,  and  could  also  include  someone  with  a \nsubstance  abuse  disorder.  That  was  in  consultation  with  the  recovery \ncommunity.  \n \nIn addition, the bill as written changes the appointment process. This was a \nburden for the Speaker and Majority Leader to appoint upward of 12 or 13 \nmembers for 4 different boards. We changed it so the Governor would have two \nappointments,  the  Legislative  Commission  would  continue  to  appoint  a \nLegislator, and the Speaker and Majority Leader would appoint one person to \neach  of  the  Boards.  The  rest  of  the  appointments  would  be  done  by  the \nBehavioral Health Commission. The Behavioral Health Commission would make \nall appointments that were not otherwise designated to be made by somebody \nelse.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY:  \nI would like the Committee to refer to the one page amendment (Exhibit J). In \nthe bill there are seven mandatory appointments and another six appointments \nthat are at the option or willingness of the Commission of Behavioral Health to \nappoint. The mandatory and optional appointments are as follows in Exhibit J.  \n \nI would like the Committee to refer to the proposed amendment (Exhibit K), \nsection  1.  The  word  \"Commission\"  on  line  5  refers  to  the  Commission  on \nBehavioral Health. On page 3, subsection 2 also refers to the \"Commission\" \nwhich  is  the  Commission  on  Behavioral  Health,  and  their  duties  and \nappointments. If you look on page 4, subsection 7, this gives some appointment \npower that the Commission did not normally have. I will read some of these \nappointments on Exhibit K. Just be aware that within this amendment the word \n\"Commission\"  is  used  in  several  places  where  it  can  mean  the  Legislative \nCommission or the Commission on Behavioral Health.  \n \nASSEMBLYMAN YEAGER: \nIn closing, I think the discussions about which Commission we are referring to \nwhen we talk about appointments within the bill may need to be refined. We \nwill continue to refine this and work on consensus. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 1, 2019 \nPage 8 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe intent is to leave it as the Commission on Behavioral Health. If there are \nportions changed, you will let us know before work session? \n \nASSEMBLYMAN YEAGER: \nThat is accurate.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWhat were the conversations with the other Regional Boards about these last \nminute changes? \n \nASSEMBLYMAN YEAGER: \nThese discussions have been ongoing since we first submitted the bill. Most of \nthe discussions are taking place through the National Association of Counties. I \nthink we are at a place where the Regional Boards themselves are comfortable \nenough with the map. With the exception of Nye County, the counties are at \nconsensus.   \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs there anyone in support of A.B. 76? \n \nJOAN HALL (Nevada Rural Hospital Partners): \nThe benefits of the Regional Behavioral Health Boards cannot be overstated. The \nNevada Rural Hospital Partners (NRHP) are in 15 of the 17 Nevada counties. We \nare not in Esmeralda County and Eureka County and that is because they do not \nhave hospitals. The NRHP has employed two of the Regional Behavioral Health \nCoordinators, one in the Rural Region and one in the Northern Region. We are \nintimately involved with how these amendments were written and why. The \nRural Region was perceived to be more Statewide than rural and that caused \nSenator Goicoechea, who was the Legislator for the Rural Region, to call me \nand tell me this could be a problem. The Rural Board had difficulty with quorums \nand travel distances, so adding those other counties seems untenable. The Rural \nRegion also had membership positions they were unable to fill.  \n \nThe NRHP is supportive of the amendment. All of the hospitals involved in this \nare in agreement that this seems to be the correct region. \n \nTRAY ABNEY (Recovery Advocacy Project, Inc.): \nWe are in support of A.B. 76. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 1, 2019 \nPage 9 \n \nJOELLE GUTMAN (Washoe County Health District): \nI am here to represent my past experience with the Regional Health Boards. I \nwas the former Rural Regional Behavioral Health Coordinator. The biggest issue \nwas I represented seven counties, which is 64,000 square miles and 58 percent \nof the State. If you add Nye County and Esmeralda County that number would \nbe 89 percent of the State. This would deteriorate the fidelity of the Coordinator \nposition.  It  was  already  hard  enough.  I  was  traveling  about  2,200  miles  a \nmonth. We do not need the addition of the other two counties.  \n \nMICHAEL  HACKETT  (Nevada  Public  Health  Association;  Nevada  Primary  Care \nAssociation): \nWe have not had a chance to fully digest the amendments, but from what I \nheard today, both organizations are in support of A.B. 76.  \n \nDAN MUSGROVE (Valley Health System):  \nAs a nonmember of the Southern Nevada Regional Behavioral Health Board, I \nthink I set the record for testimony. On behalf of the Southern Region, we agree \nwith the new way the regions are to be divided.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 76 and open the hearing on A.B. 340. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 340: Makes various changes concerning the acquisition and \nuse of opioid antagonists by schools. (BDR 40-849) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN ROBIN L. TITUS (Assembly District No. 38): \nI  am  proud  to  present  this  bill  on  behalf  of  Assemblyman  John  Hambrick. \nAssemblyman Hambrick sends his regards and misses seeing everyone at the \nLegislature.  \n \nBefore I present this bill, I would like to provide a bit of context for you. Many \nof you may have seen a similar bill, A.B. No. 428 of the 79th Session. That bill \nauthorized pharmacists to furnish an opioid antagonist without a prescription \nunder certain circumstances. In addition, A.B. No. 428 of the 79th Session \nprohibited the development of standardized procedures and protocols that would \nprevent pharmacist from dispensing an opioid antagonist without a prescription.  \n \nThe past two years have seen a nationwide trend toward authorizing use of \nopioid  antagonists  in  schools.  We  know  that  at  least  a  dozen  states  have \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 1, 2019 \nPage 10 \n \nstatewide or school district programs allowing the use of opioid antagonists in \nschools. It is time Nevada addresses this trend.  \n \nAlthough opioid overdoses have remained flat in Nevada, in 2016 there were \n387 opioid related deaths and in 2017 there were 388 opioid related deaths. Of \nthose opioid related deaths, 34 were ages 15 to 24. What we do not know \nabout this age group is whether those opioid deaths occurred in school or how \nmany  of  them  could  have  been  prevented  had  an  opioid  antagonist  been \navailable for use in an emergency situation at the school. I would argue even \none young life is worthy of the passage of A.B. 340.  \n \nFirst, the bill authorizes a healthcare professional, who is authorized to prescribe \nan opioid antagonist, to issue an order allowing a charter, private or public \nschool to obtain and maintain an opioid antagonist on campus. This order is \nregardless if there is a person at the school who has been diagnosed as needing \nan opioid antagonist.   \n \nThe measure sets forth the specifics of the order that declares the healthcare \nprofessional  should  not  be  subject  to  disciplinary  action  by  issuing  such  an \norder.  Assembly  Bill  340  also  provides  additional  protection  for  healthcare \nprofessionals by declaring that he or she is not liable for an error or omission \nconcerning the acquisition, possession, provision or administration of an opioid \nantagonist maintained by a public or private school. Liability exemptions are also \nexemptions extended to the pharmacist who dispenses an opioid antagonist or \nwho transfers an order to another pharmacist at the request of a private or \npublic school.  \n \nIn  regard  to  administering  and  storing  of  an  opioid  antagonist  at  a  school, \nA.B. 340 language is similar to the language for an EpiPen, which is already \npermitted in schools. School nurses or designated employees at the school may \nadminister an opioid antagonist maintained at the school to any person believed \nto be experiencing an opioid related overdose.  \n \nThe  governing  body  of  each  school  must  adopt  a  policy  to  ensure  when \nsomeone  seeks  emergency  assistance  from  experiencing  an  opioid-related \noverdose on the premises of the school, the parent or guardian of a student \nwho was administered the opioid antagonist be notified as soon as possible.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 1, 2019 \nPage 11 \n \nFinally,  much  like  protections  afforded  to  healthcare  professionals  and \npharmacists,  A.B.  340  extends  exemption  from  liability  to  schools,  school \ndistricts, employees and others affiliated with the school from certain damages \nrelated  to  acquisition,  administration,  possession  or  provision  of  any  opioid \nantagonist or EpiPen, which has not resulted from gross negligence or reckless \nconduct.  \n \nTREY DELAP (Group Six Partners, LLC):   \nI am the Director of Group Six Partners, LLC. One of our objectives this Session \nhas  been  to  increase  opportunities  for  recovery  and  decrease  barriers  for \nrecovery. Death is certainly a barrier to recovery. I have a handout (Exhibit L) \nand  testimony  (Exhibit  M).  The  distribution  of  Naloxone  (Narcan)  in  the \ncommunity is part of a comprehensive community level reduction strategy to \nincrease access to opioid antagonists. By making Narcan readily available and \noffering training on its use, we are increasing opportunities to save lives from \nopioid overdose. We first train lay responders on the signs of overdose and then \nprovide  them  with  the  only  overdose  reversal  medication  available. \nConcurrently, we are advancing the public discussion on the addiction epidemic \nhighlighted by the rapid rise in overdose deaths in recent years. It should be \nnoted that the National Association of School Nurses endorses this policy and \nthey provide technical support in developing school district level policies.  \n \nIf you attend the short training you will be provided an overdose kit and it looks \nlike this (Exhibit N). It contains first responder barriers such as gloves and a \nmask. The training will show you basic indications that someone may be having \nan overdose. If you suspect someone is having an overdose, you first call 911, \nthen remove the Narcan nasal spray. You administer it and if the person is in an \noverdose of an opioid they will respond immediately to it. If they are not in an \nactive overdose of an opioid, it will not work and have no other effect. It is \nimportant to know that Narcan will not adversely affect someone who is not \nhaving an opioid overdose. These kits are being paid for by the Nevada State \nOpioid Response grant.  \n \nIn southern Nevada, 1,844 individuals have received training in the use of the \noverdose kits, 6,433 kits have been distributed and 8 kits have been refilled. If \nyou use your kit, you get it refilled. This is a continuation of the good work \ndone in 2015, which was the Good Samaritan Drug Overdose Act that provided \ngeneral immunity to lay people. Nevada Revised Statutes 453C.050  defines \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 1, 2019 \nPage 12 \n \nopioid related drug overdose. What is key is anything that a reasonable lay \nperson might think is an overdose.  \n \nThe bottom line is, if you are having an opioid overdose and you do not get this \ntreatment you will die. If you are not having an opioid overdose and do not need \nthis treatment, but if you get treated, you will have not have an ill effect.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSeeing no questions from the Committee, I will open A.B. 340 for support. \n \nCATHERINE O'MARA (Nevada State Medical Association): \nNevada physicians are in support of this bill. It will give resources to schools to \nappropriately respond to an overdose. I want to add for the record, Narcan is \nreadily available, it is easy to be trained on its use and it can save lives. It is still \nimportant to contact emergency services.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSome of the Committee members may remember last Session, when we heard \nthe bill on the EpiPen. During that time, we had the opportunity to have some \nfamilies who sat on the floor with us, who had children who were alive because \nwe got past some of our own barriers and decided it was okay for school nurses \nto have EpiPens in schools. There are kids who are alive today because of that. \nOpioid overdose may be a less comfortable topic, but we have many people at \nrisk.  \n \nIs there anyone opposed to A.B. 340? \n \nGRAHAM GALLOWAY (Nevada Justice Association):   \nThe purpose and goal of this bill are laudatory, they are good. Unfortunately, it \nis not a perfect bill. We are in opposition to A.B. 340 because it gratuitously \ngives immunity to almost anyone or everybody who comes in contact with the \nprograms that would be created by this bill. I have not heard anything today, \nnor did I hear anything in the Assembly, that justifies such a radical change in \nour civil justice system.  \n \nOur civil justice system is based on accountability, responsibility and negligence. \nThis bill provides a free pass to negligent individuals. The question I have, do \nwe not want people who administer this antagonist at the top of their game? \nWe want them to perform appropriately and correctly. This bill in an odd way \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 1, 2019 \nPage 13 \n \ndoes not foster that. It sanctions bad behavior. It has three separate immunity \nprovisions. I think you want to encourage good conduct, not bad conduct.  \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nWhen you say bad behavior, what does that look like? \n \nMR. GALLOWAY: \nOur  problem  with  the  bill  is  the  immunity  provision.  There  is  no  need  for \nimmunity. I have not heard a justification for immunity. We are talking about \nimmunity  for  the  person  who  administers  the  antagonist,  the  persons  who \nmonitor  the  individual  after  the  antagonist  has  been  administered  and  the \npersons who distribute it. It is hard for me to envision exactly how the train can \ncome off the track, but given the opportunity, the train always comes off the \ntrack. Somehow, some way, someone will do something that is negligent and \nwe oppose a free pass.  \n \nLINDSAY ANDERSON (Washoe County School District): \nWe are neutral on this bill, primarily because it is not a mandate. This program is \na \"may\" not a \"shall\". We do not have a registered nurse in every school. We \nhave about 30 nurses to cover 100 school sites in the Washoe County School \nDistrict. The medical team members we have are called Clinical Aids. They have \nzero medical training. We do not ask them to diagnose students or families on \ncampus. For example, if a student presents themselves short of breath, we ask \nthem to call 911, and that is the extent of the medical training they get from us.  \n \nWe  have  no  known  evidence  of  opioid  overdoses  on  school  campuses  in \nWashoe County. That could be because once we call 911 and the person is \ntransported, we do not receive a follow-up why the person needed medical \nattention. I am not sure if we will take advantage of this program. \n \nBRAD KEATING (Clark County School District): \nI will echo the same sentiments as Washoe County School District. We have \nFirst  Aid  Safety  Assistants,  they  are  not  certified  school  nurses.  For  these \nreasons we are neutral.  \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN TITUS: \nThis bill is all about immunity. This program will not work for all schools. It will \nnot be needed in all schools. This bill is an enabling act that gives schools the \noption to have this program if they believe this is needed.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 1, 2019 \nPage 14 \n \nIn  an  overdose  medical  emergency,  people  should  not  have  to  worry.  They \nshould not have to think to themselves, should I do this, will I get in trouble, will \nI  get  sued  or  what  should  I  do.  The  reason  this  bill  is  written  this  way  is \nbecause in that critical moment, a life is saved. If you are not sure if it is an \noverdose, it is okay, because you are not going to hurt them. This encourages \npeople to act. This program will not work for all school districts, but it will be \navailable, if there is a need.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIs it true that fentanyl, if it is laced with a drug that you could take at school, \nyou can overdose on it?  \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN TITUS: \nAbsolutely. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIs it true if a person is not breathing and you suspect that they have taken an \noverdose, there is any harm that comes to that person by taking Narcan? Has \nthat ever been shown? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN TITUS: \nThere is no harm; however, when the overdose patient wakes up, they might be \nmad because they will go through an immediate withdrawal.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIs it true when you call 911, if they do not come within two minutes, when the \npatient has quit breathing they could die in that time? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN TITUS: \nThat is true. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIt is true that anyone can get this, without a prescription and age limit? Can you \njust go to the pharmacy and ask for it?  \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN TITUS: \nYou have to be trained before they will dispense it to you. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 1, 2019 \nPage 15 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIs it true that epinephrine is not as benign as Narcan? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN TITUS: \nI would say yes. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThere was a study done in 2018. It concluded that public access to Narcan \nwould be a useful tool to reduce the time of Narcan administration, particularly \nin areas where opioid overdoses are clustered.  \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN TITUS: \nThat is today's reality. It may not be in every school, but there may be certain \nareas where this will save lives. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI am going to close the hearing on A.B. 340 and open the hearing on A.B. 170. \n \nASSEMBLY  BILL  170  (1st  Reprint):  Revises  provisions  relating  to  health \ninsurance coverage. (BDR 57-278) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN ELLEN B. SPIEGEL (Assembly District No. 20): \nAssembly Bill 170 is all about access to health care and insurance. The bill does \ntwo things. First, it makes it easier for people to get an appointment with a \nprovider  who  is  in  network.  There  are  a  number  of  Nevadans  who  have \ndifficulty  accessing  health  care  within  their  networks.  They  try  to  get  an \nappointment with a network provider and it can take months, especially if it is \nwith a specialist. This bill sets up a framework where the Office of Consumer \nHealth Assistance (OCHA) will be able to help those consumers.  \n \nCurrently, every insurance company has an 800 contact number on the back of \ntheir proof of insurance card. People can call this number if they are having \ndifficulty getting an appointment. However, when they call the 800 number, the \npeople answering the phone are not able to help them.  \n \nIt turns out the insurance company has someone who is either a navigator, case \nmanager or facilitator who is able to get them an appointment with someone in \nnetwork. If the insurance company does not have a provider in network of the \nright  specialty,  they  also  have  the  ability  to  negotiate  an  out-of-network \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 1, 2019 \nPage 16 \n \nagreement.  The  problem  is  people  often  cannot  get  to  the  navigator,  case \nmanager  or facilitator.  If A.B. 170  passes, the insurance  companies will  be \nrequired to give the name and contact information for one of their navigators, \ncase managers or facilitators to the Office.  \n \nIf Nevadans have trouble navigating the system, they can call the OCHA and \nthe OCHA can step in and help them get to the right person on an expedited \nbasis and help them get the appointment.  \n \nAnother duty for OCHA will be to provide a report to the Legislature. This report \nwill include the number of times people encountered this difficulty and what \nspecialties were requested. This will allow the Legislature to take next steps in \nthe future. \n \nFinally, OCHA will help patients initiate complaints to the Insurance Division if \nthey are warranted.  \n \nThe second part of A.B. 170 will take all the provisions within S.B. 235 and add \nthem to this bill. Senate Bill 235 has already been heard and passed by this \nCommittee.   \n \nSENATE BILL 235: Revises provisions relating to health insurance coverage. \n(BDR 57-734) \n \nSenate Bill 235 is related to preexisting conditions. Should the Affordable Care \nAct (ACA) be overturned, Nevadans with preexisting conditions will continue to \nhave access to insurance.  \n \nAt this point I have introduced an amendment (Exhibit O) to add cosponsors to \nA.B.  170.  I  have  a  list  that  contains  a  number  of  Senators  and \nAssemblymembers, who have signed on in support. I can read this into the \nrecord or pass it out.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will have the amendment added to the meeting minutes.  \n \nI want to state A.B. 170 includes everything that was in S.B. 235, which was \nthe bill the Senate passed and was sponsored by this Committee. We have \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 1, 2019 \nPage 17 \n \ndouble-checked  A.B.  170  and  that  language  is  identical  to  the  language  in \nS.B. 235.  \n \nVIVIAN LEAL (Multiple Sclerosis Society): \nI will read my testimony (Exhibit P) in support of A.B. 170. \n  \nBROOKE MAYLATH (Transgender Allies Group): \nI could go on and on about what a great bill this is, but I will just say I concur \nwith Ms. Leal. \n \nHEATHER ARESHENKO: \nI am a multiple sclerosis patient, I am mother and I am a speech pathologist. I \nwill read my testimony (Exhibit Q) in support of A.B. 170.  \n \nLONNY RIMEL: \nHealthcare advocates are essential for getting patients the care they deserve. \nDoctors  and  nurses  cannot  be  the  focal  point  for  determining  patient  care \nthrough  the  insurance  maze.  We  need  these  medical  professionals  to \nconcentrate on getting their patients well, rather than being versed on which \nlab, hospital or specialist will be compatible with a patient's insurance. Illness, \ninjury and disease are bipartisan. Having an advocate will alleviate the stress for \nthe patient.  \n \nJOE CASEY (NARAL Pro-Choice Nevada): \nOn behalf of the 44,000 members, we urged your support of A.B. 170. As you \nknow  pregnancy  was  once  considered  a  preexisting  medical  condition. \nAssembly Bill 170 keeps those protections regardless of what happens at the \nfederal level.  \n \nMS. O'MARA: \nWe support A.B. 170. As networks continue to narrow, we are seeing our \npatients  have  more  challenges  trying  to  find  in-network  physicians  or  other \npractitioners. We are seeing this trend particularly impacts cancer patients. We \nsupport the protections for preexisting conditions. If we were to go back to \nbefore  the  ACA,  the  rules  on  preexisting  conditions  affected  25  percent  of \nNevadans who would be at risk for denial based on a preexisting condition. \nThose preexisting conditions include: cancers, HIV, AIDS, heart disease, kidney \ndisease,  mental  disorders,  arthritis  and  many  others.  Declinable  medications \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 1, 2019 \nPage 18 \n \nincluded anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, anti-psychotic and many other medications. \nThere is a lot on the line and this bill does a lot to protect patients in Nevada.  \n \nTOM CLARK (Nevada Association of Health Plans): \nI was given permission by Mr. Abney to represent America's Health Insurance \nPlans as well. Both organizations are in support of A.B. 170.  \n \nLAURA HALE (Indivisible Northern Nevada):   \nI am one of nearly 1,800 members of Indivisible Northern Nevada. We are in \nsupport of A.B. 170. \n \nHEIDI ENGLAND (Multiple Sclerosis Society): \nI have testified twice before in support of these bills. I was a former Nevada \nState  worker.  When  the  State  of  Nevada  insurance  program  changed,  their \nspecialty care pharmacy decided to withhold my drug from me. They withheld \nmy drug and I could not get any help from anybody. Nobody could help me. I \nneeded someone there to bridge that gap. Because of the stress of not receiving \nmy medication, I got sick. I lost the feeling in my arms and hands. It has been \ntwo and half years since that happened and I still cannot feel my hands. I had to \nretire, otherwise I would still be working for the State of Nevada. I started \nworking in this Legislative Building in 1985. I would still be working if there was \nsomeone who could have helped me.  \n \nELISA CAFFERATA (Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada): \nI would like to register our support of A.B. 170, particularly for the protection \nfor folks with preexisting conditions. \n \nSARA CHOLHAGIAN (Dignity Health-St. Rose Dominican; Dignity Health-St. Rose \nDominican Neighborhood Hospitals): \nWe are in support of A.B. 170. As healthcare providers, we support efforts to \nhelp patients navigate through the healthcare system by setting up a system in \nOCHA for patients to use. This bill will provide a valuable resource for patients.  \n \nWe also support the data collection in this bill. For years our firm has attended \nand monitored the Division of Insurance, Network Adequacy Advisory Council. \nOne of the challenges we have heard is having the data to determine where or \nhow to intervene. By collecting the data on how many times this navigator \nprocess is used by patients specific to a provider type, we will get a look at the \nchallenges faced in this community.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 1, 2019 \nPage 19 \n \nSTEWART FERRY (National Multiple Sclerosis Society): \nI want to echo the amazing specificity the Committee has heard here today in \nsupport of A.B. 170. \n \nPATTI MASON: \nI want to share my personal story. I have an autoimmune disease that causes \nheart palpitations, racing pulse, sleep issues, anxiety and depression. About a \nyear ago I was diagnosed with a rare neuroendocrine tumor. The insurance \ncompany I had wanted to send me to someone who had never treated this. The \ntumor is close to nerves that affect my brain and face. I declined to have the \nsurgery with her, because she had not seen this type of tumor before. I now \nhave a different insurance company and have been trying to navigate to whom I \ncan see about this condition.  \n \nCHRISTINE NOELLERT (Multiple Sceloris Invincibles):  \nI will read my prepared testimony (Exhibit R). I think it is important to have an \nadvocate who has the patient in mind and not an insurance company who is \njust trying to walk you through a system that does not work. The insurance \ncompany is not knowledgeable on the particular illness you have. They just slap \nthese numbers together and you are stuck with whatever they come up with.  \n \nIn addition, my friend in Exhibit R is in an appeals process with the insurance \ncompany. An OCHA representative could help her appeal the case, because the \ninsurance company is not doing anything for her. My friend is just one example \nout of thousands that have this happen to them every day.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs there anyone in neutral position for A.B. 170? \n \nCARRIE  EMBREE  (Governor's  Consumer  Health  Advocate,  Office  of  Consumer \nHealth Assistance, Department of Health and Human Services): \nThe OCHA assists consumers and injured employees to understand their rights \nand responsibilities under healthcare plans. This office investigates complaints \nof consumers and injured employees regarding their healthcare plans and assists \nin  resolving  their  complaints.  The  OCHA  provides  referrals  to  appropriate \nagencies  or  other  entities  that  are  responsible  for  a  specific  complaint.  The \nOCHA provides assistance and information concerning health care. Having a \ncontact person at each health plan will benefit the Ombudsman working with \nconsumers and expedite our ability to alleviate their concerns.  Access to health \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 1, 2019 \nPage 20 \n \ncare means different things to different people. For the insured it can mean \nfinding a provider or getting prior authorization for a particular procedure. For \nsome  it  is  finding  services  not  covered  under  their  insurance  plan.  For  the \nuninsured it means access to basic healthcare services. This bill will provide a \nmechanism for reporting on access to care issues that will assist the State in \nidentifying the gaps in service, and could be used to identify trends related to \naccess to healthcare services for the insured.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nAre you already doing what this bill is proposing to do, but just need more help?  \n \nMS. EMBREE: \nWe  do  some  of  what  this  bill  proposes  to  do.  We  currently  assist  insured \nconsumers in accessing the services they need. What is different in this bill is \nthe language in NRS requiring health plans provide us contact information for \ntheir navigators. This would be a great assistance for OCHA. We do have some \nof the health plans access information, but we do not know them all. This will \nhelp us stay current. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nDoes this bill require them to tell you, as well as the new Ombudsman, who \nthey are and what their contact information is? \n \nMS. EMBREE: \nIt requires them to tell OCHA who their navigators are.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nDoes this bill mandate that? \n \nMS. EMBREE: \nThis bill mandates that. \n \nCODY  PHINNEY  (Deputy  Administrator,  Division  of  Health  Care  Financing  and \nPolicy, Department of Health and Human Services): \nWe are glad we were able to make some adjustments to this bill to remove our \nfiscal note. We are neutral on A.B. 170. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 1, 2019 \nPage 21 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe  only  amendment  we  had  for  this  bill  was  the  collection  of  sponsors \nExhibit O. Is there anyone who would like to be added to the list? \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI would like to be added to the list. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe are going to add Senator Hardy to the list of sponsors. \n \nSENATOR  SPEARMAN  MOVED  TO  AMEND  AND  DO  PASS  AS \nAMENDED A.B. 170. \n \nSENATOR HARDY SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nMOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 170 and open the hearing on A.B. 156. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 156 (1st Reprint): Revises provisions governing the education \nof a child who is in need of protection. (BDR 38-458) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN DANIELE MONROE-MORENO (Assembly District No. 1): \nI served as the Chair for the Interim Committee on Child Welfare and Juvenile \nJustice. Assembly Bill 156 was presented to the Committee by representatives \nfrom Legal Aid of Southern Nevada, who work in the foster care arena. This bill \nexpands the role of educational decision makers into the foster youth realm. \nCurrently,  the  law  allows  courts  to  appoint  educational  decision  makers  for \nchildren  with  disabilities  when  there  is  no  parent  available  or  the  parent  is \nunable or unwilling to make these decisions for their child.  \n \nBAILEY BORTOLIN (Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada; Washoe Legal Services): \nThis bill highlights the nexus between education and our child welfare system. \nStatistics show that 47.5 percent of foster youth graduate from high school as \nopposed to 83.9 percent of the non-foster youth and only 3 percent of our \nfoster youth graduate from college. As you heard, there is a similar statute that \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 1, 2019 \nPage 22 \n \nexists for children with disabilities to have an educational advocate. We are \nexpanding that requirement to every 432B case. For every child in care, the \njudge will take the time to say who is advocating for this child's education. This \nis most likely the parent, but not in all cases. There are times when the child \nhas been removed from the parents and the school does not know if the parents \nare the right person to release school information to.  \n \nA foster child typically changes schools an average of eight times throughout \ntheir  time  in  care.  In  order  to  keep  the  child's  most  updated  educational \ninformation that makes it into the court report for every hearing, they need an \neducational advocate. There needs to be someone advocating for the child's \neducation who can say this is what is going on, this is what they are doing in \ntheir classes, this is how many classes they have missed. The court can make \nsure they are having that conversation, because with so many emergencies that \nhappen in that child's life, this is just one of those areas that gets overlooked.  \n \nThe  bill  does  two  specific  things.  It  requires  the  court  identify  who  the \neducational decision maker is and it lays out specific educational information \nthat should be reported to the court in each report.  \n \nKELLY VENCI GONZALEZ (Team Chief, Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada): \nOne of my responsibilities is managing our volunteer advocate program. We \nprovide advocates for kids with disabilities and they advocate on behalf of the \nkids  through  the  special  education  system.  They  make  sure  they  get  the \nservices they need so they can be successful.  \n \nMany times when we get a request the child is in crisis. They have had years of \nacademic failure, repeating a grade, been expelled or suspended. We would like \nto see a more proactive approach, where someone is charged with monitoring \nthe child's education. I will tell you, education is the least discussed topic at a \npermanency hearing. We want to make a child's education discussed at these \nhearings.  \n \nI am also a Court Appearance Professional (CAP) attorney representing kids in \ncare. Over spring break myself and other CAP attorneys like to go out and visit \nkids because they are not in school and we can see a lot of them at once. I \nvisited nine of my clients and none of them were doing well in school. They \nwere all below grade level and struggling. These kids can do well; some of them \nhad done well in the past. They just need the right support.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 1, 2019 \nPage 23 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI am confused. The court appoints the decision maker and then the court uses \nthe decision maker to decide how to help the child. Is that the way it works? \n \nMS. BORTOLIN: \nThe court would get updates from the advocate as to what is going on at \nschool. Outside of the courtroom, this advocate now has the legal authority to \nhave access to the child's school information. Without the appointment by the \ncourt it can be confusing for the school as to who they can release information \nto. If something is happening at the school, it clarifies who should sign for it \nand who the school should communicate with.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nDoes the advocate stay with the kid? The court does not have to appoint a new \nadvocate each time the kid changes schools, is that correct? \n \nMS. BORTOLIN: \nThat is correct. That is the goal. We hope that it will flow with the permanency \nplan. We start with the rebuttable presumption that we are trying to move the \nchild back home with the parents and it will typically be the parents. But if the \nplan was to move to adoption by the child's grandmother, it may make sense to \nmake the grandmother the educational decision maker. Otherwise, she might \nhave to wait until adoption to have the educational authority to interact with the \nteachers and get that report and information. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nFor clarity, this does not introduce a new person into this child's life? This is \nsomeone who is already in their sphere, who can make education decisions? \n \nMS. GONZALEZ: \nCurrently, we look to people who know the child. That might be a foster parent, \nparent  or  relative.  We  always  look  for  someone  who  knows  the  child.  A \nvolunteer education advocate would be the last resort, when there is no one \nwho can make those decisions for the child.  \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThere is a bill, S. B. 267, which requires the Department of Education to take \ninto consideration some of the social determinants for children. It builds on \nsomething that Assemblywoman Speigel introduced last Session. It creates a \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 1, 2019 \nPage 24 \n \nnetwork of support. You might look at this, because I believe there is some \nsynergy there.  \n \nSENATE  BILL  267:  Makes  revisions  concerning  the  effect  of  social  and \nenvironmental factors on education. (BDR 34-578) \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs there anyone in support of A.B. 156? \n \nKENDRA BERTSCHY (Deputy Public Defender, Public Defender's Office, Washoe \nCounty): \nMy Office represents parents who are involved in the foster care dependency \nsystem. We are in support of A.B. 156. We believe it will help streamline the \nprocess and ensure each child knows they have a champion in their corner.  \n \nOn a personal level, I have attended several individualized educational plans and \nintervention meetings within the Washoe County School District and this is a \ndifficult process. This bill is important for those children. \n \nDAVID BOIRE (Children's Advocacy Alliance): \nWe are in support of A.B. 156. It provides a safety net for foster children. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 156 and open the hearing on A.B. 164. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL  164 (1st Reprint):  Revises provisions relating to marijuana. \n(BDR 40-619) \n \nASSEMBLYMAN YEAGER: \nAssembly Bill 164 addresses advertising within the cannabis industry, as well as \nregistered agent cards which is the State system for vetting employees. I have \nfollowed the industry's progress since medical marijuana sales were legalized in \n2013. Medical marijuana was in Nevada's State Constitution much earlier than \nthat, but it was not until 2013 that the Legislature established dispensaries for \nmedical marijuana.  \n \nI have attended several fact finding missions to other states and looked at their \nindustry to see how Nevada can do it right. In 2013, I went to Arizona with \nSenator Hammond and learned about their medical marijuana program. In 2015, \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 1, 2019 \nPage 25 \n \nwe  went  to  Colorado  with  other  Legislators  and  lawmakers  to  meet  with \nregulators and learn about Colorado's adult use program. Before the Session of \n2016, we traveled to Oregon to learn about their early start program, which we \nwere able to do here in Nevada. Most recently in 2018, after the election I \ntraveled to San Francisco with some other Legislators to look at consumption \nlounges. This bill does not deal with consumption lounges. I will say the trip to \nSan Francisco was quite an eye-opening experience.  \n \nIn the 2017 Session, I was able to bring some of the lessons learned from those \nstates to assist in shaping policy here relating to advertising, consumer safety \nand  public  safety.  In  my  view,  Nevada  has  done  an  exceptional  job \nimplementing strict rules that protect consumers and public safety, rather than \nwaiting for problems to occur and then react to those problems.  \n \nThat being said, each year our system in Nevada continues to mature, and \nlawmakers, the industry and stakeholders work to identify improvements that \ncould  be  made  to  increase  efficiency  and  efficacy  of  those  regulations. \nAssembly Bill 164  proposes  some  of  those  changes  identified  through \ncollaboration among industry stakeholders, as well as regulators and lawmakers.  \n \nRIANA DURRETT (Nevada Dispensary Association):  \nI serve as the Executive Director of the Nevada Dispensary Association. The \nAssociation represents the majority of dispensaries throughout the State. Many \nof them are vertically integrated, which means they own and operate cultivation \nand production facilities. The intent of the bill is to improve on Nevada's strict \nregulatory  framework,  and  make  improvements  to  the  efficiency  and \neffectiveness of those regulations.  \n \nI  want  to  give  a  background  of  the  dispensary  advertising  rules.  After  the \ndelegation  returned  from  their  visit  to  Colorado  in  2016,  they  had  lessons \nlearned to apply to Nevada. During the meetings with Colorado, the Nevada \ndelegates were urged to get ahead of the safety issue.  \n \nNevada took their advice seriously and one bill passed was S.B. No. 344 of the \n79th  Legislative  Session.  That  bill  enacted  rules  on  advertising,  packaging, \nlabeling and written notification warnings. The Governor's Task Force during the \nlast  Session  made  further  recommendations  on  packaging,  labeling,  written \nnotifications and signage. Those were adopted as permanent regulations that \ngovern adult use sales. The Governor's Task Force consisted of representatives \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 1, 2019 \nPage 26 \n \nfrom: the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Department of \nTaxation,  local  government,  the  Governor's  Office,  Legislators,  law \nenforcement,  marijuana  industry  and  youth  and  adult  drug  use  prevention \nadvocates. The Nevada Dispensary Association supported S.B. No. 344 of the \n79th Session and the measures recommended by the Governor's Task Force.   \n \nAssembly Bill 164 does not seek to relax these rules. The industry supports \nthose rules. This bill seeks to shift focus from pre-approving advertisements and \ninstead focus on issuing penalties for advertisements that do not follow the \nrules.  \n \nCurrently,  every  advertisement  has  to  be  submitted  for  pre-approval.  Every \nadvertisement you see in Nevada has gone through this approval process. Even \nif the approved advertisement is changed slightly, such as a change in the font \nor color of the background, it has to go back to the approval process. This is \nnot a quick process.  \n \nAssembly Bill 164 would direct the Department of Taxation to charge fines and \nconduct  enforcement  on  advertisements  that  break  the  rules,  rather  than \nspending staff resources pre-screening thousands of advertisements.  \n \nIn  its  current  form,  the  bill  proposes  to  allow  the  Department  to  accept \nbackground checks to get the agent cards to work in the industry that the \nDepartment deems reliable and expedient. The process to get an agent card \ntakes longer than it should.  \n \nThe  bill  further  allows  the  Department  to  revoke  agent  cards  for  certain \noffenses, such as stealing product on camera or being convicted of a theft \noffense. In the past the Department has wanted to revoke an agent card for \nthese offenses, but has not been able to.  \n \nThe  bill  removes  the  requirement  for  pre-approval  of  legal  marijuana \nadvertisements. It does not seek to relax the rules. The same rules apply, such \nas you cannot appeal to children and you cannot have misleading statements. \n \nThe bill also requires local governments to adopt an ordinance if they choose to \nregulate  the  content  of  advertisements.  This  would  not  prevent  local \ngovernments from regulating advertisements, it just states they need to adopt \nclear rules that can be consistently applied.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 1, 2019 \nPage 27 \n \nThe bill incorporated already existing language regarding requirements to obtain \nan agent card, but removes language that specifies who would pay for the card.  \n \nThe bill does make one minor modification to advertising, to now state: \n \nShall not place an advertisement at an entertainments event if it is \nreasonably estimated that 30 percent or more of the audience who \nwill attend that entertainment to be persons who are less than 21 \nyears of age.  \n \nFor example, to advertise on TV you have to prove that the youth viewership is \nexpected to be less than the 30 percent. This would apply the same threshold \nto entertainment events. For example, if there was a beer tasting event which is \ngeared for adults, that advertising would be allowed. \n \nThere is one amendment (Exhibit S) that changes the validity of an agent card \nback to one year. The bill was proposing to make the card good for two years, \nwhich resulted in a fiscal impact. This amendment would change it back to one \nyear, which should result in a zero fiscal impact.  \n \nThe current rule is taxicabs can advertise marijuana and this amendment just \nkeeps that status quo to continue these advertisements.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSeeing no questions from the Committee, is there anyone to testify in support \nof A.B. 164? \n \nNICK MARANO (Green Thumb Industries Nevada):  \nI  am  the  President  of  Green  Thumb  Industries  Nevada.  We  are  a  vertically \nintegrated  medical  and  adult  use  cannabis  firm.  We  have  active  cultivation, \nproduction, and retail licenses. This bill streamlines the agent card application \nprocess, which has taken up to six months or more to get an agent card issued \nto our employees. We believe this bill introduces much needed improvements to \nsignage and advertising regulations.   \n \nKRYSTAL SAAB (General Counsel, Nevada Organic Remedies; the+Source): \nI will read my testimony (Exhibit T) in support of A.B. 164.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 1, 2019 \nPage 28 \n \nWILL ADLER (Silver State Government Relations; Scientists for Consumer Safety): \nI agree with the detailed testimony Exhibit T by Krystal Saab. This industry has \nshown itself to meet the gold standard for advertising, and would like to be \ntreated as normal businesses.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWhen  you  get  pre-approval  it  is  done  by  someone  sitting  at  a  desk  versus \nsomeone  going  out  in  the  field  getting  post-approval.  Will  there  be  a  fiscal \nproblem with someone having to do work outside of the office? \n \nMR. ADLER: \nThat  would  be  a  better  question  for  the  Department  of  Taxation.  In  my \nconversations with them, they indicated they will save staffing hours because \nthey  will  not  have  to  pre-approve  every  advisement.  A  violation  would  be \nreported to the State and the Department would take action.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWill the industry send the advertisement and not wait for approval, or will the \nindustry just advertise and it is up to the Department of Taxation to find the \nadvertisement? \n \nMR. ADLER: \nWe currently send in every advertisement and every adaptation of the ad to the \nDepartment of Taxation. This will no longer be the case. The Department would \ndo a periodic review.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAs I understand this bill, there would be no review process. It would only be a \ncomplaint based system. \n \nMR. ADLER: \nThat is my understanding of A.B. 164.  There would no longer be a pre-approval \nprocess, but it would be a complaint based violation process.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 164 and open the hearing on A.B. 228. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 1, 2019 \nPage 29 \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 228 (1st Reprint): Expands the jurisdiction of the Office of the \nState Long-Term Care Ombudsman to protect persons receiving services \nfrom certain additional entities. (BDR 38-171) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN LESLEY E. COHEN (Assembly District No. 29): \nI was the Chair of the Legislative Committee on Senior Citizens, Veterans and \nAdults with Special Needs. Assembly Bill 228 will authorize the expansion of \nservices  of  the  Office  of  the  Long-Term  Care  Ombudsman.  This  Office  will \nadvocate for persons when services do not meet standards.  \n \nThe Nevada Revised Statutes 427A.125 created the Office of the State Long-\nTerm  Care  Ombudsman  within  the  Aging  and  Disability  Services  Division \n(ADSD) of the DHHS. This Office advocates for residents in long-term care \nfacilities. The Ombudsmen are trained to resolve problems and represent the \nresident's perspective in monitoring laws, regulations and policies. \n \nDuring  the  Interim,  the  Committee  received  a  presentation  concerning  the \nOffice. The purpose of the presentation was to learn about the clients currently \nserved by the Office and how clients are informed of the services offered by the \nOffice.  \n \nWe  learned  that  there  are  currently  12  Ombudsmen  providing  advocacy  to \nlong-term care facilities in Nevada.  \n \nAssembly  Bill  228  provides  that  the  ADSD  Administrator  may  direct  the \nOmbudsman or an advocate to investigate complaints involving persons with \ndisabilities  who  receive  services  from  certain  facilities,  which  include: \n(1) facilities for long-term rehabilitation, which provides residential services for \nrehabilitation  from  an  acute  illness  or  injury  for  longer  than  a  month; \n(2) community-based living arrangements; (3) supported living arrangements and \n(4) day care centers for adults.  \n \nSection 8 prohibits facilities for long-term care to retaliate against any person \nwho  files  a  complaint  with,  or  provides  information  to,  the  Office  for  the \nadditional providers. \n \nSection 10 provides a new requirement for all identified service providers to \npost instructions listing the procedures for making a complaint to the Office. \nThe instructions must include a telephone number, email address or internet \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 1, 2019 \nPage 30 \n \nwebsite  for  making  complaints.  Section  10  further  provides  that  if  a \nservice provider fails to post this information the  ADSD may, by regulation, \nprescribe a civil penalty not to exceed $500.   \n \nHOMA WOODRUN (Chief Advocacy Attorney, Office of the State Long-Term Care \nOmbudsman,  Aging  and  Disability  Services  Division,  Department  of \nHealth and Human Services):  \nThere is a trend this Session to address the needs of the vulnerable among us in \nNevada, from housing, to individuals in a mental health crisis, to the rights of \npersons  with  dementia,  to  the  needs  of  adult  with  disabilities  and  more. \nAssembly Bill 228 as amended fits well with so many efforts to not override \nindividual autonomy and choice, but provide advocacy for individuals at their \ndirection. In the 2017, A.B. No. 31 of the 79th Sessioin was passed. This bill \nexpanded  the  role  of  the  Office  from  older  adults  to  include  persons  with \ndisabilities at any age.  \n \nDuring that Session, there was also a bill that passed that took the long-term \ncare Ombudsman from representation of individuals over the age of 60 to those \nwho reside in facilities for long-term care. Last Session, Assemblywoman Titus \nintroduced  a  similar  bill  as  far  as  expanding  the  role  of  the  long-term \nOmbudsman into other settings; however, that bill did not pass.  \n \nThe amendment will address the need for individual advocacy without creating \nany  burdensome,  ongoing  monitoring  or  visits  into  these  settings  that  are \nalready regulated. This avoids duplication of services.  \n \nNevada is one of three states that does not have adult protective care services, \nwhich are services for persons with disabilities between the ages of 18 and 59 \nregarding abuse, neglect, exploitation, isolation and abandonment. That bill will \nbe  coming  forward  as  a  budget  Bill  Draft  Request  14-1201.  It  is  ADSD's \nposition  that  by  allowing  the  Administrator  to  direct  Long-Term  Care \nOmbudsman  Advocacy  into  these  settings  would  complement  the  Adult \nProtective  Services  (APS).    This  expansion  would  allow  an  APS  worker  to \nidentify the need for this advocacy in a specific setting that an individual would \nbenefit from without overlapping other advocacy, such as the Nevada Disability \nand Law Center and Support Arrangement living settings.  \n \nBILL  DRAFT  REQUEST  14-1201:  Revises  provisions  relating  to  vulnerable \npersons. Later introduced as (S.B. 540) \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 1, 2019 \nPage 31 \n \nBy  way  of  information,  the  National  Long-Term  Care  Ombudsman  Resource \nCenter  identifies  that  the  three  most  common  areas  of  reported  complaints \nregarding nursing facilities include: improper eviction, discharge planning, issues \nregarding  unanswered  questions  or  lack  of  respect  for  residents.  Regarding \nassisted living or residential settings, the three most common complaints are \nimproper eviction or discharge planning, addressing the quantity, quality and \nchoice of food and the administration of medication.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nDoes the other bill that you are talking about pay for the $2.7 million or did the \nfiscal note go away? \n \nMS. WOODRUN: \nIt is our understanding the fiscal note regarding the bill as originally written \nwould be removed. This bill would allow us to serve in specific ways, track the \ndata and come back if we see there is an overwhelming need with a concrete \nfiscal note. The fiscal note as originally written was in terms of mandating a \nreplication of the program for these settings, which is quite a lot of homes. We \ndid not feel there was enough data to support that.  \n \nHELEN FOLEY (Center for Assisted Living): \nWe support A.B. 228. There was an attempt to get an Ombudsman in to all \nfacilities where our vulnerable people reside, where others are paid to take care \nof them. That did not happen. There was a $6 million fiscal note on the bill and \nit died. This bill will not have automatic inspections, but everyone has access to \nthe Ombudsman. I am happy to see the fiscal note removed from this bill.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 1, 2019 \nPage 32 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSeeing no further business we are adjourned at 6:07 p.m.  \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nMichelle Hamilton, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:   \n   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 1, 2019 \nPage 33 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nExhibit / \nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \n# of pages \n  A  2    Agenda \n  B  8    Attendance Roster \nA.B. 49  C  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nA.B. 85  D  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nA.B. 124  E  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nA.B. 131  F  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nA.B. 471  G  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nA.B. 76  H  108  Assemblyman Steve Yeager  Annual Report \nA.B. 76  I  4  Senator Joseph Hardy  Proposed Regional Map \nA.B. 76  J  1   Senator Joseph Hardy  Proposed Amendment \nA.B. 76  K  8  Senator Joseph Hardy  Proposed Amendment \nTrey Delap / Group Six \nA.B. 340  L  1  Handout \nPartners, LLC \nTrey Delap / Group Six \nA.B. 340  M  2  Testimony \nPartners, LLC \nTrey Delap / Group Six \nA.B. 340  N  1  Picture OD Kit \nPartners, LLC \nAssemblywoman Ellen B. \nA.B. 170   O  1  Amendment \nSpiegel \nVivian Leal / Multiple \nA.B. 170  P  2  Testimony \nSclerosis Society \nA.B. 170  Q  1  Heather Areshenko  Testimony \nChristine Noellert / Multiple \nA.B. 170  R  2  Testimony \nSclerosis Invincibles \nA.B. 164  S  1  Assemblyman Steve Yeager  Amendment \nKrystal Saab/ Nevada \nA.B. 164   T  2  Organic Remedies;  Testimony \nthe+Source \n ", "35": "\nMINUTES OF THE  \nSENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n \nEightieth Session \nMay 6, 2019 \n \n \nThe Senate Committee on Health and Human Services was called to order by \nChair Julia Ratti at 4:00 p.m. on Monday, May 6, 2019, in Room 2135 of the \nLegislative Building, Carson City, Nevada.

(BDR S-399) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN TERESA BENITEZ-THOMPSON (Assembly District No. 27): \nI am here today to present A.B. 133 for your consideration. \n \nThis bill is essentially a one-section bill with the purpose of stating a legislative \nfinding that homeless youth are indeed part of the homeless population. This bill \ncomes  from  conversations  with  Eddy  House  which  is  a  drop-in  center  for \nhomeless youth in Reno. In 2018, they served 682 homeless youth from the \nages of 18 to 24. Of these 682 youth, 71 percent were from Washoe County \nwith 8 percent from rural Nevada. \n \nWe have specific groups in the State that work around homeless youth. We are \nhoping to make a declaration that we see this population as a population that is \ndifferent, has different needs and receives services in different ways from our \nadult  homeless  population.  This  includes  funding  pathways  from  the \nU.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development when they are looking at \ntheir continuum of care and count days specific to homeless youth. \n \nIt is fitting and appropriate that we make an acknowledgment of this population \nwithin the present Nevada statutes. \n \nI have submitted information on the 2018 HUD Continuum of Care Homeless \nAssistance Programs (Exhibit C and Exhibit D) and the 2018 Washoe County \nHomeless Youth PIT Count Results (Exhibit E). \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will entertain a motion on A.B. 133. \n \nSENATOR WOODHOUSE MOVED TO DO PASS A.B. 133. \n \nSENATOR HARDY SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2019 \nPage 3 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 133 and open the hearing on A.B. 353. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 353 (1st Reprint): Revises provisions governing the disposition \nof certain types of materials and waste produced by certain governmental \nentities.

(BDR 40-704) \n \nASSEMBLYMAN JASON FRIERSON (Assembly District No. 8): \nThis bill has taken over a decade of work to address what we have come to call \nsurprise billing or balanced billing. \n \nThird-party healthcare payers are responsible for providing members with access \nto  appropriate  quality  care  at  a  reasonable  cost.  This  is  accomplished  by \nengaging  in  contractual  partnerships  with  hospitals,  physicians  and  other \nproviders.  It  is  critical  to  keep  premiums  and  rates  affordable  for  employer \nsponsored plans and individual policyholders. The provisions of these contracts \nprovide for agreed upon rates that are substantially discounted. \n \nAs the marketplace dictates, sometimes payers are fortunate to contract for \ndiscounted rates with all of the hospitals and physicians in that community. \nSometimes business negotiations fail and prevent payers from contracting with \nall hospitals and physicians. The standard practice and the majority of benefit \nplans require the members to obtain nonemergency care through contracted \nphysicians or preferred hospitals. The payment for those services and care are \nat agreed upon contract rates. \n \nIn emergencies, the members may go to a hospital that may be out-of-network. \nIn these instances, the patient is billed at a rate that is substantially higher by \nthe out-of-network hospital than the contracted rates provided by an in-network \nhospital. In some cases, the health insurance only covers a small portion of the \ncost or even none of the cost. The patient is financially vulnerable even though \nthey have health insurance. \n \nAssembly  Bill  469  seeks  to  address  this  problem  by  prohibiting  an \nout-of-network provider who provides medically necessary emergency services \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 8, 2019 \nPage 4 \n \nto a person covered by a policy of health insurance from charging that person \nan amount that exceeds the copayment, coinsurance, or deductible required by \nthe policy.  The essential goal of A.B. 469 is to take the patient out of the mix \nand incentivize the interested parties to resolve this without the patient. \n \nAssembly Bill 469 requires an out-of-network facility, under the aforementioned \ncircumstances, to notify the third party that provides coverage for the person \nwho is receiving such services at the facility. It further requires transfer of that \ncovered  person  to  an  in-network  facility  no  later  than  24  hours  after  the \nperson's emergency medical condition is stabilized. \n \nThe bill also establishes a basis for payment under two different scenarios. For \nproviders  that  were  previously  contracted  or  in-network  within  the  previous \n24 months, the bill requires the third party to pay and the provider to accept as \ncompensation for those services an amount based on the amount that would \nhave been paid for those services under the most recent contract between the \nthird party and the provider. The third party would pay 108 percent of the \namount  if  they  are  less  than  12  months  out-of-network  and  subsequently \n115 percent if they are out-of-contract for more than 12 months but less than \n24 months. For providers who have never been in-network or are beyond that \ntwo year mark, the third party is required to make a final offer of payment to \nthe provider for the medically necessary emergency services. \n \nIf a provider does not accept the offer then the parties are required to submit \nthe dispute to binding arbitration. To be clear in this measure, an out-of-network \nprovider includes: a provider of health care; a hospital; or an independent center \nfor emergency medical care that has not entered into a contract with a third \nparty for the provisions of health care to persons who are covered by a policy of \ninsurance. \n \nThe bill exempts critical access hospitals and a person covered by a policy of \ninsurance sold outside of Nevada. \n \nThe cost of out-of-network emergency care is a challenge, not only in Nevada \nbut across the Country. Nevada has wrestled with this issue for many years. \nThis  bill  is  not  great  for  the  providers  or  facilities.  It  is  not  great  for  the \nthird-party payers, but I believe its passage will greatly benefit Nevadans with \nhealth  coverage  who  may  find  themselves  in  an  out-of-network  hospital \nreceiving treatment from an out-of-network provider in an emergency situation. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 8, 2019 \nPage 5 \n \nIn this bill's simplest terms, a patient should not be caught up in the middle of \nthis. The patient should be able to go to a hospital for emergency care, and \neverybody else other than the patient should figure it out. If they cannot figure \nit out, they go to arbitration, and there is an offer. They accept it and live with \nthe offer or make a counter-offer. \n \nThere is a proposed amendment (Exhibit C) that makes technical adjustments \nthat all stakeholders agreed were necessary to make sure we convey the intent \nof the bill and the intent of the parties coming to this resolution. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSince there are no questions from the Committee, I will ask if there is anyone in \nsupport of A.B. 469. \n \nRANDY SOLTERO (United Food and Commercial Workers International Union): \nWe are in support of A.B. 469. \n \nPHILIP RAMIREZ (Prominence Health Plan): \nProminence Health Plan is a Reno-based company, providing health insurance to \nover 32,000 lives in northern and southern Nevada. Prominence Health Plan, \nformerly  known  as  Saint  Mary's  Health  Plans,  has  served  employer  groups, \npatients and Medicare eligible Nevadans for over 25 years. We employ over \n150 Nevadans  and  provide  insurance  coverage  for  important  consumer  and \nbusiness advocacy groups such as the Reno + Sparks Chamber of Commerce. \n \nI  cannot  understate  the  significant  issue  surprised  billing  has  been  for  our \ninsureds for many years. We receive countless personal stories of individuals \nand families impacted by this practice. This is a landmark consumer protection \nbill. While compromise means that all parties must make a sacrifice to reach an \nunderstanding, A.B. 469 ensures the interest of the patient is protected, which \nis as it should be. This is why we support this bill. \n \nKANANI ESPINOZA (Boyd Gaming Corporation):  \nWe are in support of A.B. 469. Boyd Gaming Corporation has approximately \n12,000 employees in Nevada and insures approximately 1,400 employees and \nfamilies. Our employees and their families should have the security and peace of \nmind that an emergency medical visit will not place their family in financial \njeopardy. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 8, 2019 \nPage 6 \n \nLINDSAY KNOX (Nevada Orthopaedic Society): \nProviding the best possible care for our patients is our top priority. Our members \nstrive to be in-network due to the fact our care does not end in the emergency \nroom. Being in-network is extremely important to our patients and physicians. \nWe are not and we are glad this bill takes the patient out of the middle. We are \nalso supportive of the reporting mechanism contained in the bill. \n \nHANNA OLIVAS (Culinary Union): \nI am in support of A.B. 469. I will read my testimony (Exhibit D). \n \nSHAUN BEST: \nI am in support of A.B. 469. I will read my testimony (Exhibit E). \n \nALFREDO ALONSO (UnitedHealth Group Inc.): \nWe support all the work done for the past ten plus years, which is what it took \nto get us here today. The stakeholders negotiated for hours on end. I did not \nthink we would get to where we are today. Everyone is going to be moderately \nupset with this bill, which means it is perfect. \n \nNICK VASSILIADIS (Anthem, Inc., Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Anthem \nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Healthcare Solutions): \nThis bill has been a decade in the making and it has been tough, very tough. I \nthink everyone is slightly upset, but the good thing is the patient is out of the \nmiddle. This is a fight for everyone else to deal with. We support A.B. 469. \n \nFRAN ALMARAZ (Teamsters Local No. 631; Teamsters Local No. 986): \nI represent the over 25,000 teamsters in Nevada, who welcome this bill. Many \nof our members have received surprised billing, even though we have great \ninsurance. \n \nTOM CLARK (Nevada Association of Health Plans): \nThere was a lot of work done creating this bill and I believe that just like an \nemergency room, what goes on behind the curtain is what is really important. \nThe consumer is protected and that was the goal. There were two other goals \nas well. Fix the contracting issues and do it in a way that does not erode the \ngreat insurance plans we currently have in Nevada. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 8, 2019 \nPage 7 \n \nRAYMOND MCALLISTER (Nevada State AFL-CIO): \nWe have 170,000 members and families. We are in support of A.B. 469. I have \nbeen one of those people who has worked on this issue for what seems like \ndecades. \n \nTODD INGALSBEE (Professional Firefighters of Nevada): \nWe support A.B. 469. We echo the remarks of everyone else. \n \nMIKE RAMIREZ (Las Vegas Police Protective Association Metro, Inc.): \nI also represent the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, Employee Health \nand  Welfare  Trust.  We  cover  over  11,000  bodies;  both  retired  and  active \nmembers. We support A.B. 469. This is a step in the right direction to protect \nthe patients from balanced billing. \n \nJIM SULLIVAN (Culinary Union): \nThere has been a lot of compromise, but we have taken the patient out of the \nmiddle of this process. We support A.B. 469. \n \nALFONSO LOPEZ (Sheet Metal and Air Rail Transportation): \nWe are in support of A.B. 469. \n \nSTACIE SASSO (Health Services Coalition): \nWe  represent  roughly  280,000  lives  in  southern  Nevada  between  our \n25 employer and union self-funded health plans. This bill offers great protection \nfor the patients and keeps them from medical bankruptcy.  These people are \naccessing health care in the event of an emergency. They do not have the time \nto see if the hospital is on their health insurance plan. We support A.B. 469. \n \nBOBBETT BOND (Culinary Health Fund): \nThe Culinary Health Fund covers 126,000 lives in southern Nevada. We have \nbeen part of this process for about 15 years. This bill is not perfect; all of us \nwish it were slightly different. Every plan in the State has the opportunity to \nhave its members protected from balanced billing. We hope this is something \nthe insurance plans adopt to protect those patients. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs there anyone neutral on A.B. 469? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 8, 2019 \nPage 8 \n \nSUSAN FISHER (Nevada State Society of Anesthesiologists): \nWe agree with what everyone else has said, but we are neutral on A.B. 469. \n \nJESSE WADHAMS (Nevada Hospital Association): \nIt took us a long time to get to neutral on A.B. 469. \n \nJOANNA JACOB: (Physicians for Fair Coverage; Dignity Health-St. Rose \nDominican): \nWe  are  here  neutral  for  A.B.  469  and  we  have  filed  detailed  testimony \n(Exhibit F) outlining our concerns and issues in regard to this bill. \n \nI would like to add patients must understand when they are covered under this \nbill. We know that this is not a complete solution to surprise billing even though \nit is an admirable first step. \n \nThere are two important components to this bill. There is going to be a list of \ninsurance plans who elect to be covered by this bill. This will be published on \nthe Department of Health and Human Resources (DHHS) website. The other \nimportant  patient  protection  is  the  definition  of  \"medical  necessity\"  and  a \n\"prudent person\". \n \nCATHERINE O'MARA (Nevada State Medical Association): \nWe are neutral on A.B. 469. We believe in the aspect of the bill that protects \nthe patient. We do remain a little concerned about the implementation of this \nbill. We have had discussions about the narrowing of insurance networks and \nwhat that means to the patients in Nevada who have limited options. Narrow \nnetworks helped create the problem of balanced billing. \n \nWe are solving part of the problem, but we need to keep an eye on it.  We will \nbe back as the bill is implemented to let you know how it is going. I am hopeful \nI can return next Session and say, \"This is going well and patients are out of the \nmiddle, insurance plans have opted in, physicians are billing better and everyone \nis getting along.\" \n \nWe are not able to say this now. If there are issues that impact access to care,  \nthreaten our safety net, payment shenanigans, or we start seeing networks \nnarrow, we would like the opportunity to address this in the Interim and next \nSession. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 8, 2019 \nPage 9 \n \nI  represent  all  the  physicians  in  this  State  and  that  includes  emergency \nphysicians and those who take trauma calls. This bill will affect them. They \nrespond to the call under their code of ethics without doing a wallet check, \nwithout making sure the patient is insured or has an ability to pay. We want \nthem to continue to do that. We also want patients to continue to go to the \nemergency room in an emergency situation. As this bill gets implemented, if \nthere is an impact on this effort, we will report this back to you. \n \nWe  are  pleased  with  the  transparency  contained  in  this  bill,  including  the \nopportunity to report this kind of data to DHHS. There is a little more work on \nthe regulations to make sure health plans are opting in, so physicians will know \nif their plan has opted in. There will be a bit of regulation work on the arbitration \nside  which  is  important  to  physicians.  The  average  emergency  bill  is  under \n$1,000. We want to make sure we have access to a remedy that does not cost \nmore to resolve than what the claim is worth. \n \nJESSICA FERRATO (American College of Emergency Physicians): \nThe  American  College  of  Emergency  Physicians  represents  more  than \n500 emergency doctors in Nevada. We service about 1.5 million patients per \nyear Statewide. This bill impacts every single one of the doctors that are part of \nthis association. This is a contentious issue. We are neutral because we have \nsome physicians that are comfortable with this bill and some who are not. \n \nI want to highlight some portions in this bill that we appreciate. Section 17, \nsubsection 3, outlines the small claims arbitration process. Our average bill is \nunder  $1,000  and  we  wanted  to  make  sure  there  was  fair  access  to  an \narbitration process. We did not want the cost of arbitration to be double the bill \nwe are arbitrating. Section 19 is a transparency measure. This allows us to \nreport to DHHS to track how this bill is performing, the impact to patients, the \nimpact  to  physicians  and  the  insurers.  This  is  an  outlet  to  report  the \nramifications and perhaps unintended consequences or positive consequences. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 469 and open the hearing on A.B. 129. \n \n ASSEMBLY BILL 129 (2nd Reprint): Requires certain first responders to receive \ncertain  training  concerning  persons  with  developmental  disabilities. \n(BDR 40-157) \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 8, 2019 \nPage 10 \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN CONNIE MUNK (Assembly District No. 4): \nAssembly Bill 129 is the result of what I call my Otto Zehm Story. Otto Zehm \nwas a man with a developmental disability from Spokane, Washington, who \ndied March 20, 2006 during an altercation with police officer Karl Thompson. \nOtto committed no crime, and on May 30, 2006, the Spokane County coroner \nruled the death a homicide. \n \nOn March 18, 2006, Otto, who worked as a janitor and did not own a car, had \ngone on foot to an ATM at his bank to withdraw money from his account. \nTwo young  women,  who  were  in  a  car  at  the  ATM  when  Otto  arrived, \nerroneously reported to police by phone that a man was attempting to steal \nmoney from the ATM. The women followed Otto in their car while reporting \nadditional information to police dispatch by phone. \n \nOtto next entered the convenience store that he routinely visited to buy a soft \ndrink and fast food. Video from the convenience store security cameras showed \nthat within 16 seconds of officer Thompson entering the store, the officer had \nrun up to Otto, whose back was initially turned to him, twice ordered him to \n\"drop the pop\" and batoned Otto to the ground; the first of at least seven baton \nstrikes used on Otto, including strikes to the head. Within another 16 seconds \nOtto had also been tasered. In addition to multiple beatings and tasering, Otto \nwas improperly hog-tied by police and placed on his stomach for more than \n16 minutes.  Furthermore,  the  police  requested  a  non-rebreather  mask  from \nparamedics at the scene and strapped it to Otto's face. The non-rebreather \nmask was not attached to oxygen. Otto stopped breathing three minutes after \nthe mask was placed on his face. When ruled a homicide by the county coroner \non May 30, 2006, the cause of death was reported as \"lack of oxygen to the \nbrain due to heart failure while being restrained on his stomach\". No illegal \ndrugs or alcohol were found in Otto's system. The altercation was on tape at \nthe convenience store. \n \nBy the time Otto died, there were seven other policemen holding Otto down. He \nwas crying out and he could not understand why he was being hit and treated \nthis way. His last words were, \"All I wanted was a Snickers bar.\" \n \nI was working as a mental health specialist at the time and Otto had been my \nclient and patient. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 8, 2019 \nPage 11 \n \nAssembly  Bill  129  requires  ambulance  attendants,  firefighters,  emergency \nmedical  technicians,  paramedics  and  peace  officers  to  complete  training  of \ndevelopmentally disabled persons so they can learn to identify and interact with \ndevelopmental disabilities. It further requires first responders, who are already \ncertified or licensed to submit on or before October 1, 2020, proof that they \nhave completed training. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI want to bring to the attention of the Committee that we have a proposed \namendment  from  the  Nevada  Justice  Association  (Exhibit  G).  Seeing  no \nquestions from the Committee, I will open the meeting to anyone in support of \nA.B. 129. \n \nTOM DUNN (Professional Firefighters of Nevada): \nWe are in support of A.B. 129 for several different reasons. First of all, there \nhave been several incidences nationally that involved people with developmental \ndisabilities with both police and firefighters that have had less than a positive \noutcome. A couple of years ago, there was a national story where there was a \nperson with developmental disabilities sitting in the middle of the roadway. His \ncaregiver was attempting to get him out of the roadway and unfortunately, that \ncaregiver was shot by a law enforcement officer who did not have the proper \nlevel of training. \n \nOne of the biggest reasons why we are here to support A.B. 129 is one of our \nmembers, Art Reitz and his wife Carol have a child who has autism and they run \na JUSTin HOPE Foundation in Reno, Nevada. The JUSTin HOPE Foundation is a \n501(c)(3) nonprofit that has provided training for first responders for the last \nfour years across the State, free of charge. \n \nTo  date,  they  have  trained  over  2,800  first  responders.  The  JUSTin  HOPE \nFoundation also provides additional services. They also run a small business that \nprovides funding for the Foundation. They provide a facility for people with \ndevelopmental disabilities and their families. \n \nMR.  M. RAMIREZ: \nThe Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department currently provides this training. \nThis  would  codify  what  we  are  already  doing  and  we  are  in  support  of \nA.B. 129. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 8, 2019 \nPage 12 \n \nJOHN PIRO (Clark County Public Defender's Office): \nThis is a great bill and we are glad our concerns were addressed with the \namendment. To be clear, we are in support of A.B. 129 with the amendment \nthat removes the language about willful misconduct. Were that amendment not \nto go through, we would move to opposition. \n \nTESSYN OPFERMAN (City of Reno): \nWe are in support of A.B. 129. We feel it is important our first responders get \ntraining to handle developmental disorders. We are in support of the bill as \nwritten,  not  with  the  proposed  amendment.  Developmental  disorders  are \ncomplicated and we do not want to put this responsibility on our firefighters and \npeace officers. \n \nTheir main goal is to fight fires and save lives and we are concerned about the \namendment. We would be happy to work with Assemblywoman Munk. I think \nthat there can be some language that we can agree on so that we protect our \nfirst responders and make sure they get the necessary training. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIt is my understanding there are other places in the law where law enforcement \nalready enjoys broad protections from liability under sovereign immunity. \n \nIs  there  anyone  who  is  able  to  address  this?  I  believe  there  are  already \nprotections from liability and if you could articulate why what is already in law \nis not sufficient, that would be helpful. \n \nMS. OPFERMAN: \nI do not know the specific protections, but you are right, they are protected in \nmany cases. We can get back to you. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nYou are not in favor of the amendment, but feel training is important. Is this \nsomething you are already doing? \n \nMS. OPFERMAN: \nWe  are  definitely  in  support  of  the  training  part.  The  amendment  proposed \nremoves section 10.5. We would like to keep section 10.5 or potentially come \nto another amendment to protect our first responders. We are not in support of \nremoving the indemnity portion of section 10.5. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 8, 2019 \nPage 13 \n \nJOELLE GUTMAN (Washoe County Health District): \nWe are in support of A.B. 129. The Health District used grant funding from the \nNevada Governor's Council on Developmental Disabilities to develop a one-hour \nonline  training  for  first  responders  with  affiliated  continuing  education \nunits (CEUs) for law enforcement and other first responders. We are pleased to \noffer this training Statewide. \n \nCHRISTIAN MORRIS (Nevada Justice Association): \nI am here on behalf of the Nevada Justice Association in support of A.B. 129. \nWe think it is an excellent bill as it has been amended. It will support the \ncommunity and most important, protect the most vulnerable members. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nCan you explain the reason for the amendment? \n \nMS. MORRIS: \nThere is sovereign immunity already in place for members of the government \nand their actions in the course and scope of their employment. In this case, we \ndo  not  want  the  unamended  version,  because  we  want  to  ensure  those \nvulnerable members of society can be made whole. \n \nWe do not want to rob them of their rights while we are putting a law in place \nto protect them. There is sovereign immunity already in place which has a cap \non  those  damages  and  certain  administrative  processes  that  need  to  occur \nbefore you could \"sue\" a member who works for the government whether they \nbe a police officer or firefighter. \n \nThis bill should not give an absolute blanket immunity; this would in some way \ncontradict  the  sovereign  immunity  laws  that  are  already  in  place.  More \nimportant, in the event something occurs where there is negligence, there is \nalready  a  process  in  place.  Without  the  amendment,  the  rule  would  be \nsomewhat in contradiction to the  way the sovereign immunity caps already \nexist. \n \nWe want to encourage the training, but we do not want to make it impossible \nfor people in some cases to be made whole in the event negligence occurs. As \nit is amended, it is a bill that we fully support and believe to be necessary. The \nimmunity language states if they do not get the training they are 100 percent \nimmune. That would be in conflict with the way the sovereign immunity rules \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 8, 2019 \nPage 14 \n \nwork and the caps for anyone who works for the government, medical provider, \ncounty or State. \n \nJIM HOFFMAN (Nevada Attorneys for Criminal Justice): \nWe support A.B. 129 with the amendment and would oppose A.B. 129 without \nthe amendment. The first point is we have this negligence process and under \nthis process either a judge or a jury looks at the case and decides whether the \nfirefighter  or  the  police  officer  was  acting  in  the  way  that  an  ordinary, \nreasonable person would. If they are acting reasonably, the case gets dismissed; \nnobody  is  liable.  It  is  only  firefighters  or  police  officers  who  are  acting \nunreasonably, who are doing something that they should not be doing who are \ncovered by the negligence standard. I do not think this portion is necessary. It \ngives them absolute immunity even when they are being unreasonable. I do not \nthink that would protect disabled people. I think it hurts them. \n \nThe second point is no other profession has this kind of absolute immunity \nbased on training. I am a lawyer and I have to take training every year. I can still \nbe sued for malpractice if I screw up. A doctor has to take training every year \nand they can be sued for malpractice. I do not think we should give absolute \nimmunity to police officers, firefighters, etc. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN TERESA BENITEZ-THOMPSON (Assembly District No. 27): \nI wanted to support my colleague Assemblywoman Munk. I have been working \nwith her on this bill. I want to address the point that has been made about the \nconflict over the amendment. We are having ongoing conversations because we \nwant to strike the right tone. I think the example that was just given about \ndifferent licensing types having ongoing and mandated training by their licensing \nboards is a good example. A firefighter is not a licensing type with a licensing \nboard with an ongoing CEU requirement. We are talking about training, which is \nmore of an awareness of this special population. We do not think that level of \ntraining  constitutes  proficiency;  certainly  not  clinical  proficiency.  It  is  not  a \nproficiency standard similar to a licensing standard. We hope to come to a good \nresolution. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 129 and open the hearing on A.B. 66. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 66 (1st Reprint): Provides for the establishment of psychiatric \nhospitals to provide crisis stabilization services. (BDR 39-486) \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 8, 2019 \nPage 15 \n \nDOROTHY  EDWARDS  (Coordinator,  Washoe  Regional  Behavioral  Health  Policy \nBoard): \nThe Washoe Regional Behavioral Health Policy Board (WRBHPB) chose to focus \non crisis stabilization services and facilities. I will read my testimony (Exhibit H) \nto give you a background and reasons we chose A.B. 66 to be our Legislative \nrequest. \n \nCHARLES DUARTE (Chair, Washoe Regional Behavioral Health Policy Board): \nThe problem we are facing is our hospital emergency departments have become \nthe choke point in the current model of crisis care. I will read my testimony \n(Exhibit I). It is easier for law enforcement or emergency medical staff (EMS) to \ntake someone who is going through a crisis to an emergency room in order to \nget medically cleared, and wait there until a bed becomes available \n \nKey components currently missing in Nevada are crisis stabilization facilities. \nThese facilities offer short-term, subacute care for individuals who need support \nand  observation,  but  not  emergency  department  holds  or  medical  in-patient \nstays.  They  are  provided  at  lower  costs  and  without  the  overhead  of \nhospital-based acute care.  \n \nThe model has a proven track record for saving health care dollars, but more \nimportant, it saves lives. \n \nA 2016 study examined the results of 22,000 metro police and EMS transfers \ndirectly to crisis facilities located in Maricopa County in Arizona and identified \nthe following savings and outcomes: (1) it reduced potential state in-patient \npsychiatric  spending  by  as  much  as  $260  million;  (2)  it  saved  hospital \nemergency  departments  an  estimated  $37  million  in  avoided  costs; \n(3) 70 percent  of  the  patients  were  discharged  back  to  the  community  into \nfour-patient programs after a 23-hour observation stay; (4) it showed a 6 times \nimprovement in clinical fit for acute care; (5) saved the equivalent of 37 law \nenforcement officers full-time equivalent (2017 data). The program allowed for \na 5-7 minute turnaround police drop-off; and (6) it reduced in-patient hospital \npsychiatric boarding in emergency rooms by an estimated 45 years. \n \nThe intent of the WRBHPB is to define crisis stabilization services and facilities \nin statute through A.B. 66. We also wanted legislation to support appropriate \nreimbursement  for  services  by  the  Division  of  Health  Care  Financing  and \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 8, 2019 \nPage 16 \n \nPolicy (DHCFP) and their contracted Medicaid Managed Care Organizations. This \nwould be necessary to provide a sustainable revenue stream for services. \n \nWe believe A.B. 66 and the proposed amendment (Exhibit J) accomplish both of \nthese goals. Section 1 defines an endorsement process for licensing a crisis \nstabilization facility as a psychiatric hospital. Any facility that applies would \nneed to meet the criteria established in the bill and make sure they can be \nlicensed as a hospital \n \nThe amendment eliminates language allowing Division of Public and Behavioral \nHealth (DPBH) to contract for these services. The previous version of the bill \nallowed DPBH to establish these facilities on their own; however, we do not \nbelieve that is necessary. We believe by establishing the proper conditions for \nreimbursement and licensing that not-for-profit and for-profit organizations will \ncome to the State to establish crisis stabilization facilities.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe original version of the bill directed the DHHS to create these facilities and \nthat  created  a  significant  fiscal  note,  because  you  are  putting  the  State  in \ncharge of creating the facilities that meet this gap on crisis stabilization. As \namended, if you are able to be licensed as a psychiatric hospital, there is an \nendorsement. Once you are given that endorsement, you can become a crisis \nstabilization facility. That endorsement opens up a billing code that would allow \nyou to bill for those services. Is that correct? \n \nMR. DUARTE: \nYes, that is my understanding. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIf this was implemented, we would wait to see if the market is going to see \nenough potential in the new billing category to meet this system. \n \nMR. DUARTE: \nThat is correct. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThere is an elite hospital in southern Nevada that has emergency room care. It \nhas 16 beds that are not being filled. Could they become this crisis stabilization \nfacility or would they have to change their name to a psychiatric hospital? Could \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 8, 2019 \nPage 17 \n \nthey  just  become  a  crisis  stabilization  facility  without  being  a  psychiatric \nhospital? \n \nMR. DUARTE: \nI believe they have to receive an endorsement by the Bureau of Health Care \nQuality and Compliance as a psychiatric hospital to provide crisis stabilization \nservices. It would not be out of the question for an elite hospital to do. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThey could apply to be a psychiatric hospital and then could use all 16 of their \nbeds to be a crisis stabilization facility. Is that correct? \n \nMR. DUARTE: \nI believe that is correct. I am not an expert in facility licensing. \n \nERIC ROBBINS (Committee Counsel): \nThe facility would have to be licensed as a psychiatric hospital before they \ncould apply for the endorsement. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIs  there  a  special  form  you  need  to  fill  out  to  be  a  psychiatric  hospital  as \nopposed to a hospital? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nLooks like we need to get back to you on that question. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nWould this bill work in conjunction with the last bill we heard? A crisis can \noccur at any particular time. Sometimes a private citizen may see someone is \nhaving difficulty with reality. How would that work? \n \nMR. DUARTE: \nIt would work with any other bill that deals with individuals in crisis. You do not \nwant to deny law enforcement the opportunity to drop somebody off who is in \ncrisis. Law enforcement does not want to make a clinical decision based on the \nbehavior of this person that they are not trained to assess. They would be \ninclined to take everyone to these crisis stabilization facilities. You want to \ncreate the opportunity for law enforcement to successfully drop off anyone who \nis in a crisis. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 8, 2019 \nPage 18 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs there anyone in support of A.B. 66? \n \nDAN  MUSGROVE  (Valley  Health  System;  UHS  Behavioral  Health  Hospital; \nWestCare of Nevada): \nSome of us have worked on this issue for a long time back to when we thought \ncommunity triage centers were the answer. It turned out they were not. You \nhave to have a front door that can handle these folks, make the assessment and \ndetermine the best place to put them. Is it in the back room, where they can get \nthose couple of days of crisis stabilization? Is it that they just need to get back \non  their  medication?  Do  they  need  follow-up  appointments?  We  have  been \nwrestling with this idea for years and want to thank the WRBHPB for coming up \nwith a possible solution. \n \nThis bill creates a framework for a sustainable model. We need to provide a \nframework that allows this kind of facility to be sustainable and to attract the \nprivate or nonprofits who are willing to do this. In southern Nevada, I believe we \nwill need five or six crisis stabilization facilities. The reason people go to a \nhospital is because they are conveniently located. A first responder needs to go \nsomewhere quick, drop off the patient and get back to the next call. We do not \nwant to have our first responders making the clinical decision; they need to take \nthem  to  a  crisis  stabilization  facility  and  have  a  professional  make  those \ndecisions. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe  community  triage  centers  had  a  financial  model.  The  counties,  local \ngovernments  and  hospitals  would  put  in  a  share  and  then  the  State  would \nmatch that share and that would be the start-up funding for those community \ntriage  centers.  It  worked  at  first  and  they  diverted  a  lot  of  people  out  of \nemergency rooms and jails. Then it all fell apart. \n \nWe are making this a market-driven process and we are not putting any money \nin as we did with the community triage model. How do we get to sustainability \nwith A.B. 66? Who do you visualize in southern Nevada who would step up and \ntake advantage of this new endorsement? This is a critical missing gap for \npeople with behavioral health challenges. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 8, 2019 \nPage 19 \n \nMR. MUSGROVE: \nI have been linked with the funding formula since my days at Clark County in \n2002.  I  was  the  one  who  came  up  with  the  funding  formula  to  keep  the \nhospitals and local government there. In the last two years, I have dealt with \nthe WestCare issue in Reno. Subsequent legislative sessions have always put a \ngeneral fund dollar amount in DPBH for crisis services. Those dollars are in this \nbudget and can be applied for. \n \nThere is always going to be a portion of the population who is not covered by \nMedicaid. That is a problem. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \n(CMS)  has  never  recognized  community  triage  centers  because  they  cannot \nhandle the lockdown. The CMS has focused on chronic inebriates because it is \nnot a lockdown facility. That model of triage is out of date. \n \nWe  hope  this  bill  creates  something  more  sustainable  through  reimbursable \nfederal dollars. I agree with you. There may have to be General Fund dollars for \nthose folks who will never qualify for Medicaid. I think this is a good model. We \nhave to build it first to see if they come. \n \nMR. DUARTE: \nWe worked with other states that operate these crisis stabilization facilities, in \nparticular a nonprofit called Recovery International. They said we needed to \nmake  sure  there  was  an  appropriate  level  of  Medicaid  funding  for  these \nstabilization bed days, as well as for the 23-hour observation days. We believe \nwe can achieve that. The idea is not to create fiscal hurdles for this bill, but try \nto meet the needs of the organizations that are already providing these services \nin other states. \n \nMICHAEL HILLERBY (Renown Health): \nI  agree  with  the  comments  made  by  Mr.  Musgrove.  We  are  in  support  of \nA.B. 66. Renown emergency departments and trauma centers are the perfect \nplace to go for a heart attack, stroke, acute illness or severe trauma. They are \nnot appropriate for patients in a mental health crisis in need of mental health \nservices. The Renown daily emergency department census includes too many \npeople on Legal 2000 holds waiting for mental health beds. \n \nSANDRA STAMATES (Washoe Regional Behavioral Health Policy Board): \nI also work for the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) Northern Nevada. I \nhave submitted testimony (Exhibit K), but I want to talk to the Committee about \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 8, 2019 \nPage 20 \n \nthe phone call I received this morning. Two parents called me about their adult \ndaughter. Two months ago, she was in the Renown emergency room on a \nLegal 2000 hold. After two days, she was released and put on medication. \nSince that time, due to her illness she has lost her insurance and the parents \ncalled me to find out what to do. I could not help, but think a crisis stabilization \nfacility  would  be  the  place  to  take  her,  but  they  have  not  opened  yet.  I \nrecommended they call the Crisis Call Center and hopefully they would have \nsome options. If A.B. 66 was passed I would have an option to refer people to. \nIt would help me help them. \n \nMS. JACOB: \nI am here on behalf of Dignity Health-St. Rose Dominican. In the Assembly I \nsupported this bill because I am an advocate for Dignity. I go to the facilities \nthroughout southern Nevada and talk to the people who are working in the \nhospital.  I  asked  them  what  I  could  do  as  their  advocate.  The  need  for \nshort-term crisis stabilization is the most frequent response. This is why we \ntook part in the WRBHPB even though we are located in southern Nevada. \n \nKEVIN DICK (Washoe County Health District):  \nI  am  here  on  behalf  of  the  460,000  residents  of  Washoe  and  the  almost \n5 million annual visitors. I am also here representing the Washoe County Health \nDistrict.  This  piece  of  Legislation  has  been  identified  as  the  District's  top \npriority. I will read testimony (Exhibit L) outlining the importance of A.B. 66. \n \nWe have heard the problem where people in a behavioral health crisis are taken \nto an emergency room, yet they do not receive the care they need. I will read \nsome medical statistics in Washoe County, Exhibit L. I think you can understand \nfrom these figures the magnitude of this situation. \n \nThis bill creates the market conditions that will allow facilities to be established \nto provide the care these people need in a way that they can be sustainable \nthrough the reimbursement that will occur through insurance programs. \n \nRICK PORZIG (President, National Alliance on Mental Illness, Nevada): \nI  am  here  to  speak  in  favor  of  A.B.  66.  The  NAMI  is  the  Nation's  largest \ngrassroots  volunteer  organization  that  supports,  educates  and  advocates  for \nindividuals living with mental illness and their families. This bill is consistent \nwith the strategic objectives of NAMI, which is to assist the mentally ill from \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 8, 2019 \nPage 21 \n \nbecoming incarcerated. This bill would go a long way to avoid that. In addition, \nit will provide access to quality mental health care. \n \nJOAN HALL (Nevada Rural Hospital Partners): \nWe are in support of A.B. 66. We have seen similar systems of care in other \nstates.  We  believe  this  is  an  important  component  in  Nevada's  system  of \nbehavioral health. It will provide prompt access to quality care for these people \nin  great  need  and  decrease  time  spent  by  law  enforcement  and  EMS  on \ntransports and nonemergency type services. \n \nMACKENZIE BAYSINGER (Human Services Network): \nI want to agree with the previous testimony. \n \nMICHAEL  HACKETT  (Nevada  Primary  Care  Association;  Nevada  Public  Health \nAssociation): \nBoth organizations are in support of A.B. 66 with the amendment. Members of \nthese associations were part of the WRBHPB and were part of this legislation. \n \nCECELIA LAMPLEY:  \nI am a marriage and family therapist. I also worked with children with behavioral \nproblems. I did assessments of kids who had attempted suicide. This program \nsounds like it would be a good program. The thing I think has been missing \nwere the follow-up services. I think aftercare is important. I am in support of \nA.B. 66. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI see DHHS is here to testify neutral and would like them to explain the fiscal \nnote. \n \nCODY  PHINNEY  (Deputy  Administrator,  Division  of  Health  Care  Financing  and \nPolicy, Department of Health and Human Services): \nI want to give a little history about how we arrived at the fiscal note. The \nestimated cost was if DHCFP was to cover all the crisis services needed from \nJanuary  1,  2020.  The  cost  would  be  $54  million  total  computable  which \nincludes the federal funding. The State General Fund cost would be $14 million. \n \nThat estimate does take into account the services that we already pay for in \nother areas such as emergency rooms. The fiscal note uses the calculator that \nCrisis Now developed and took into consideration the Arizona rates to estimate \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 8, 2019 \nPage 22 \n \nthese  costs.  Using  those  calculations,  the  DHCFP  estimates  that  for  the \n$14 million in State General Funds spent, we would not spend and would save \n$22 million. \n \nI want to be very clear those estimates are based on flipping the switch and \nhaving these services available on January 1, 2020. It is unlikely this service \nwould be available on that date. If facilities of this type open their doors and \nprovide services in this model, there would be a gradual shift in our spending \nfrom other areas in Medicaid, over to this area in Medicaid. Essentially, there \nwould not be a huge impact to our budget. \n \nSometimes DHCFP talks about the return on investment. This applies to chronic \ndisease where there can be a number of years before we see people are getting \nhealthier. With A.B. 66 there will be a shift in service from one area to another \nand there will not be that wait time. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI need a little more clarity. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAs I understand it, this bill did not go to the Assembly Committee on Ways and \nMeans  or  Senate  Committee  on  Finance  because  the  cost  is  offset  by  the \nprojected savings. \n \nMS. FINNEY: \nYou will see those figures under A.B. 66 and the fiscal note tab. It is titled the \nDHCFP fiscal note. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nIt appears that we do not have the money up front. However, this is something \nthat needs to be done. Is there a way to form a public-private partnership? \n \nMS. FINNEY: \nI have not had that discussion with the DHHS Director's Office. I could explore \nthat and get back to you. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI think there are a lot of national organizations that are interested in doing the \ntype of work that we are talking about. They would be interested in something \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 8, 2019 \nPage 23 \n \nlike this. I am referring to S.B. No. 400 of the 79th Session and it involved \nsuccess contracts. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThis Committee still has some questions about the fiscal note. We need to have \nclarity and transparency. I believe DHCFP estimated the cost to serve every \nperson in Nevada who has a behavioral health crisis would also need crisis \nintervention. \n \nAs I understand it, if A.B. 66 was passed, there would be a regulatory process, \nthen Medicaid would get set up for billing, and people would apply for their \nlicenses.  As A.B. 66 gets implemented there will be a shift in costs from the \nmore expensive cost of the emergency room or jails to the less expensive cost \nof a crisis stabilization facility. This is the philosophical policy decision, but we \nneed clarity how that analysis will work. \n \nI am going to close the hearing on A.B. 66 and open the hearing on A.B. 122.  \n \nASSEMBLY  BILL  122  (1st  Reprint):  Requires  the  Department  of  Health  and \nHuman Services to study the feasibility of establishing certain assisted \nliving facilities in rural areas of this State. (BDR S-100) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN BENITEZ-THOMPSON: \nI  am  here  on  behalf  of  the  Committee  to  Study  the  Needs  Related  to  the \nBehavioral  and  Cognitive  Care  of  Older  Persons.    I  was  Vice  Chair  of  the \nCommittee which met during the 2017-2018 Interim. \n \nI want to give you some background on the Committee. Senate Bill No. 121 of \nthe 79th Session created the Committee and wanted them to review issues \nregarding the behavioral and cognitive needs of older persons in Nevada. The \nCommittee was comprised of three members of the Senate and three members \nof the Assembly. Senator Woodhouse served as the Chair of the Committee. \nThe Committee was required to examine, research and identify potential sources \nof State funding to assist in supporting caregivers who were caring for older \npersons with behavioral and cognitive health issues. The Committee would also \nlook at the potential to establish a higher rate of reimbursement by Medicaid for \nnursing facilities, as well as provisions for education and training for healthcare \nprofessionals. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 8, 2019 \nPage 24 \n \nAssembly Bill 122 seeks to increase options for community, based services \nsuch as adult daycare, assisted living and respite care in rural parts of Nevada. \nThis bill originally required the DHHS to apply for a Medicaid waiver. Section 3.5 \nis a feasibility study instead of a waiver. \n \nSection 3.5 authorizes the DHHS to do the feasibility study and look at three \ndifferent licensure types: assisted living facilities, respite care and adult day \ncare. These are now single licensing types and we are giving rural counties \npermission to house all three licensing types under one roof. We will see how it \nwill work and get a written report back to the Legislative Counsel Bureau to be \nsent to the Legislative Committee on Senior Citizens, Veterans and Adults with \nSpecial Needs. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nAre you looking at using the information collected by the Veterans Association \nof Nevada in regard to older adults accessing those services? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN BENITEZ-THOMPSON: \nThis feasibility study is directed to economic and fiscal viability. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThere may be some things the Veterans Association has already done that can \nhelp with this feasibility study. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN BENITEZ-THOMPSON: \nWe will look into that. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs anyone here to testify in support? \n \nMS. HALL: \nEureka and Hawthorne have a great interest in this. Hawthorne has a lot of \nveterans. We are looking at ways to keep local seniors in their communities and \nget legally reimbursed for it. We are in support of A.B. 122. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs there anyone here to testify in neutral? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 8, 2019 \nPage 25 \n \nDENA SCHMIDT (Administrator, Aging and Disability Services Division, Department \nof Health and Human Services): \nOur  rural  communities  have  many  challenges  when  it  comes  to \nlong-term-support services. We look forward to the opportunity to do this. I \nenvision the DHHS three divisions getting together to collectively get a better \nunderstanding how compliance rules and funding sources can work together.  \nWe will also look at appropriate settings and how we can create a setting that \nprovides all three of these services, and what is the mix of payer sources to \nmake it viable. We want to make sure it is a sustainable model. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI am pleased to see this issue coming about with a feasibility study. This could \nmake a difference for families trying to keep loved ones closer to home and get \nthe services they need. \n \nCHAIR RATTI:  \nI will entertain a motion on A.B. 122. \n \nSENATOR HARDY MOVED TO DO PASS A.B. 122. \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED. \n \n* * * * * \n \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 122 and open the work session on A.B. 353.  \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 353 (1st Reprint): Revises provisions governing the disposition \nof certain types of materials and waste produced by certain governmental \nentities. (BDR 40-623) \n \nMEGAN COMLOSSY (Committee Policy Analyst): \nI will read the summary of the bill and the conceptual amendment from the work \nsession document (Exhibit M). \n \nSENATOR HARDY MOVED TO AMEND AND DO PASS AS AMENDED \nA.B. 353. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 8, 2019 \nPage 26 \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED. \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the work session and open it up for public comment. \n \nI  would  like  to  add  my  own  public  comment.  It  has  been  a  particularly \nchallenging week here at the Legislature and it will probably continue for the \nremainder of the Session. It makes me reflect on what I am grateful for. One of \nthe things I am grateful for is this Committee. It may be because we have had \nthe luxury of having the same members for the past two Sessions. Maybe it is \nbecause we have the best staff. I am grateful for how we work together as a \nCommittee whether we agree or disagree. I think this Committee does a nice job \nof  making  sure  folks  have  the  information  that  they  need,  we  have  good \ndebates, people have their say and we move the business forward. We could \nnot do that if we did not do that all together.

(BDR 38-743) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN CLARA THOMAS (Assembly District No. 17): \nI  am  presenting  A.B.  344  which  aims  to  improve  care,  coordination  and \ncontinuity of care for elderly Nevadans and individuals with disabilities following \ndischarge from the hospital. I have submitted my written remarks (Exhibit B). \n \nJEFFREY KLEIN (President and CEO, Nevada Senior Services): \nOften, through personal experiences, we appreciate the impact of the healthcare \ndelivery  system  and  challenges  it  presents  to  some  of  our  most  vulnerable \nsenior citizens and individuals with disabilities. I have submitted my supporting \ntestimony and presentation for A.B. 344 (Exhibit C). \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIt sounds like this was an amazing project with good work and results. If we \nwere able to do the pilot project, what is missing that requires a change to \nNevada Revised Statutes (NRS)? \n \nJEFFREY DUNCAN (Social Services Chief, Aging and Disability Services Division, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nFormalizing this service in statute shows Nevada's commitment to a partnership \nbetween  health  care  and  social  services.  This  step  could  help  us  be  more \ncompetitive in discretionary grant opportunities. It also gives us the flexibility to \nsee if there are other resources of funding to grow services such as third-party \npayers. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nSection 1, subsection 2, paragraph (c) states \"use other options available to \nfund  the  program,  including,  without  limitation,  billing  third  parties  for  the \nservices  provided  by  the  program  to  persons  currently  covered  by  the \nthird parties.\" Section 1, subsection 3, paragraph (c), subparagraph (2) states \n\"'Third party' means: A health benefit plan, as defined in NRS 687B.470, for \nemployees which provides coverage for services and care at a hospital.\" Could \ninsurance companies be billed for this without limitation, or is this something \nalready covered in the insurance plan a patient would have? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 27, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nMR. KLEIN: \nA number of insurances do pay for different types of care transitions. Some of \nthe components of the care transitions programs are individually billable. For \ninstance, a respite coach may be billable as a person-care service. The social \nwork or counseling components could also be billed. There are insurances that \npay for care transitions. Self-insured insurance companies frequently pay for \ncare transitions and approve those payments. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThis would not be adding a burden to insurance companies already covering this \nservice? \n \nMR. KLEIN: \nCorrect. It would, however, potentially encourage changes making the process \nmuch  less  difficult  and  challenging  because  of  some  of  the  impediments \nsometimes seen in regulations. \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nIn the pilot, you are talking about hospital to home. Is there going to be any \ncollaboration  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA)  and  the \nservices in terms of transportation? \n \nMR. KLEIN: \nWe  have  been  working  in  both  pilot  programs  to  coordinate  transportation \nthrough  the  Aging  and  Disability  Services  Division.  In  some  instances,  we \ncoordinate with family caregivers for private transportation. In all cases, we \nprovide  a  mechanism  for  coordinated  transportation  resources  by  the  case \nmanagers to make sure people have access to everything they need, including \nfood, medications, doctor appointments and any other follow-up care. \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nIf there is any opportunity for collaboration, it will stretch the dollars further. I \nknow the VA has individual rides and bus-providing services. There may be \nthings during this pilot the VA is doing or knows about which civilians are \nunaware. Some of the hospitals have been strained due to Covid-19. There is an \nopportunity for collaboration. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 27, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nI read there is a 25 percent, under 30-day readmission. At one time, the Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services would not pay if the readmission was under \n30 days. How are you getting around that? \n \nMR. KLEIN: \nWe have had welcome arms from the hospitals. They have been partners on this \nfrom Day 1. The original hurdle you refer to about readmissions has changed \ndramatically. This is a development for the hospitals, which is why we have \nstrong support from them. We are actively working with ten hospitals in the \nState, including Clark County. It has been a welcome change, especially toward \nthis population which is considered high risk. These frail people are likely to \nconsume  resources  if  they  get  back  into  the  hospital.  They  start  bouncing \nbetween postacute and acute and going back and forth.  \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nYou mentioned dementia and Alzheimer's diseases. In this pilot program, will \nAlzheimer's, dementia and other rare forms of dementia such as early Lewy \nbody dementia be included? \n \nMR. KLEIN: \nWhen we started this pilot program, we tried to limit it to people who had a \ndefined dementia diagnosis or were self-identified. As the program progressed, \nit  widened  out  to  cognitive  impairment.  The  program  is  quite  broad.  It \nencompasses not only Lewy body dementia and frontal lobe dementia but also \nvascular dementias.  People forget those who have had strokes do not fully \nrecover and end up with an expressive or receptive aphasia. While not having \ndementia in the classical sense, they have the effect of a cognitive impairment. \nThe impact of case management is the same. The program has widened out \ndiagnostically, making it easier for hospitals to manage instead of figuring out if \nthis person fits into the grant slot. We went from narrow in the beginning to \nwide these days. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN THOMAS: \nWe ask the Committee to consider this viable program for our elder community \nand people with disabilities who are asking for our assistance by voting this out \nof Committee to a Floor Session. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 27, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nBARRY GOLD (AARP): \nWe support A.B. 344. In 2015, the Nevada Legislature passed S.B. No. 177 of \nthe  78th  Session,  known  as  the  Care  Act,  to  assist  and  support  family \ncaregivers. It was the first step in providing information and notification to a \ncaregiver that a patient was to be discharged from the hospital and what to do \nwhen he or she got home. It did not involve any wraparound services to help \nthe patient once home or to help that person stay home. This bill is a next and \nnecessary step. We need to get this done to prevent people from going back to \nthe hospital where they do not want to be or to spend more money. \n \nMARY LIVERATTI (AARP): \nI  support  A.B.  344.  I  am  a  volunteer  with  AARP  and  the  Alzheimer's \nAssociation. People are being discharged from hospitals with complicated and \ncomplex health conditions. My sister and I took care our aunt and father after \nmany hospital discharges. My sister has been a nurse over 35 years, and I was \na social worker for 40 years. We were a great team. On one occasion, my \nfather  was  discharged  with  a  complicated  wound  care,  and  it  took  several \nweeks  for  us  to  get  it  under  control.  Even  with  our  knowledge  of  health \nsystems, we saw how hard it was to care for and keep on top of their health \nafter discharge. I cannot imagine what families do who do not have access to \nthis kind of expertise. I urge you to pass A.B. 344. \n \nGILLIAN BLOCK (Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers): \nWe support A.B. 344. We encourage increasing opportunities for cooperation \nbetween hospitals and caregivers to coordinate health care and social services \nfor older persons and persons with disabilities. Care coordination programs can \nhelp  improve  continuity  of  care,  improve  outcomes  and  provide  a  smooth \ntransition for those who are in need of ongoing support. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will now close the hearing on A.B. 344. I will open the hearing on A.B. 138. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 138 (1st Reprint): Revises provisions governing the eligibility of \ncertain convicted persons for public assistance. (BDR 38-760) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN SUSIE MARTINEZ (Assembly District No. 12): \nI am presenting A.B. 138 which revises provisions governing the eligibility of \ncertain convicted persons for public assistance. I have submitted my written \nremarks (Exhibit D). \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 27, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nSHANE PICCININI (Food Bank of Northern Nevada): \nI  will  present  A.B.  138  and  have  submitted  written  testimony  (Exhibit  E). \nDiscussion will include the historical background of the Temporary Assistance \nfor Needy Families (TANF) program and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance \nProgram (SNAP). I will discuss what A.B. 138 intends to accomplish (Exhibit F). \nAlso submitted is information about the SNAP (Exhibit G).  \n \nThis bill removes the prohibition in Nevada law to allow individuals impacted by \nsubstance abuse felonies to get access to SNAP and TANF, which is one of the \nlast barriers facing people in need of food assistance. Recovery does not happen \nin a vacuum, it happens in a community. This bill is designed to bring people \nback into the community. \n \nANNETTE MAGNUS (Executive Director, Battle Born Progress): \nWe support A.B. 138. The ban this legislation will remedy negatively impacts \npublic  health.  The  ban  promotes  food  insecurity  and  malnutrition  for \nex-offenders  and  their  families.  It  poses  a  barrier  for  reintegration  into  the \ncommunity  and  has  a  disparate  impact  on  African  Americans,  women  and \nsurvivors of domestic violence. From July 2019 through December 2020, over \n3,800  individuals  in  Nevada  have  been  disqualified  from  SNAP  due  to  this.  \nThousands of families going hungry is unacceptable. The ban is a cruel policy, \nand we need to change this. \n \nNICK SHEPACK (American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada):  \nWe support A.B. 138. The policy, as it stands, is one of the most illogical \npolicies we know of in this State. For people to succeed and get off drugs, they \nneed their hierarchy of needs met, as Maslow would say, and the first need is \nfood and shelter. The chance for people to get to higher levels and self-actualize \nto become meaningful members of society is significantly more difficult. The \ncurrent policy talks about one felony. It is not felonies related to drugs, it has to \nbe a drug felony, which can even be for possession. It can be for a person who \nis not addicted to drugs but, nonetheless, has to complete a 30-day substance \nabuse program. There are not many drug addiction programs available. We had \nan average of less than one bed available in northern Nevada. Existing law does \nnot  make  sense  and  criminalizes  people  beyond  paying  their  dues  and \ndisproportionately affects people of color, especially Black single mothers who \nhave a difficult time supporting their children and often lose their children. This \nis a commonsense bill, and we urge you to support it. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 27, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nBEN INESS (Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada): \nWe support A.B. 138. Food insecurity and malnutrition for a person with a \nfelony drug conviction pose a barrier to reintegration into the community. It also \nhas a disproportionate impact on people of color who are unjustly targeted in \nthe war on drugs. Nearly 80 percent of people in federal prison and 60 percent \nof people in State prison for drug offenses are Black or Latino. Limiting access \nto food for someone in their family is a cruel way to encourage treatment. \n \nASHANTI LEWIS (Three Square Food Bank): \nWe support A.B. 138. Federal nutrition programs such as SNAP should be made \navailable  to  all  eligible  applicants,  especially  applicants  from  vulnerable \npopulations who are essentially shut out of housing options and have extremely \nlimited  employment  opportunities.  Removing  this  barrier  will  reduce  food \ninsecurity while helping people recover and successfully reintegrate back into \nsociety. \n \nSERENA EVANS (Nevada Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual Violence): \nWe support A.B. 138. Access to social services such as SNAP and TANF has a \npositive effect on victim survivors of violence and can be the key for them to \nleave and end an abusive relationship. Without these social service programs \nwhich allow victim survivors to care for their children, victims are more likely to \nstay in an abusive relationship and endure violence. Having access to social \nservices is an effective tool in reducing risk factors for future violence. Within \nany  community,  victim  survivors  of  violence  can  have  convictions  of  drug \nabuse, and they are just as deserving of social support. We appreciate this bill \nwill reduce barriers and enable access to SNAP and TANF benefits. Everyone \ndeserves access to food and to these life-saving programs. \n \nMS. BLOCK:  \nNevada  Coalition  of  Legal  Service  Providers  supports  A.B.  138.  I  echo  the \nremarks of previous speakers. \n \nKENDRA BERTSCHY (Deputy Public Defender, Washoe County Public Defender's \nOffice): \nWe support A.B. 138. I am testifying on behalf of the Public Defender Offices in \nWashoe and Clark Counties. This bill will help reduce recidivism and allow our \nclients to have access to services and resources to assist in their recovery. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 27, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe hearing on A.B. 138 is now closed. I will open the hearing on A.B. 430. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 430: Revises provisions relating to disabilities. (BDR 39-1048) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN TRACY BROWN-MAY (Assembly District No. 42): \nI am presenting A.B. 430. This bill is necessary and easy to move forward. \nNevada  Revised  Statutes  has  some  negative  terminology,  which  can  be \neliminated.  Chapter  435  of  NRS  relates  to  individuals  with  intellectual  or \ndevelopmental  disabilities.  The  focus  of  the  bill  is  to  remove  outdated  and \noffensive  language.  Specifically,  this  bill  removes  a  reference  to  a  State \nAssociation for Retarded Citizens which no longer exists in Nevada. \n \nJESSICA ADAMS (Deputy Administrator, Aging and Disability Services Division, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nAssembly Bill 430 revises certain terms and removes related obsolete terms \nexisting within NRS 435. Section 1 replaces obsolete language with \"reside in \nan  appropriate  community-based  setting  that  is  not  a  facility.\"  Section  2 \nremoves the obsolete references to the State Association for Retarded Citizens \nand its board as this organization no longer exists in Nevada. Fee schedules \nestablished by the Administrator of the Aging and Disability Services Division \nare subject to the approval of the Department of Health and Human Services \nDirector.  Section  3  updates  the  legislative  intent  for  jobs  in  day-training \nservices. This will change the purpose of jobs in day-training services for people \nwith intellectual and developmental disabilities by changing the phrase \"help \nthem become useful citizens\" to \"increase independence.\" This bill has no fiscal \nnote. These changes align with the terms and phrases used daily and represent \nterminology used in the field, as well as respectful language deserved by the \npeople we serve. \n \nPATRICIA  (ACE  PATRICK)  UNRUH  (Chair,  Nevada  Statewide  Independent  Living \nCouncil): \nSince the late 1960s, there has been an evolving movement toward person-first \nlanguage. It originated in Sweden and began to be incorporated in the U.S. with \nhistorical acts within our Constitution. Now it is the accepted terminology of the \nAmerican Psychological Association and further translates into most government \nacts  such  as  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  and  the  Individuals  with \nDisabilities Education Act. It only makes sense Nevada ensures our language in \nstatutes follow suit. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 27, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nThe  purpose  behind  person-first  language  is  to  emphasize  the  individuality, \nequality  and  dignity  of  people  with  disabilities  and  maintain  individuals  are \npeople first and foremost. People's traits and medical conditions do not define \nwho  they  are  but  rather  are  a  trait  or  medical  condition.  Using  person-first \nlanguage reduces social stigmas and provides a reference that places all people \nin the same category before introducing any other aspects to be considered. \nAlthough  not  every  person  agrees  with  person-first  language,  it  generally \ninvolves  mutual  respect  and  is  appreciated  by  the  majority  of  the  disability \ncommunity. This bill supports person-first and respectful language options for \npeople  with  disabilities.  The  most  important  thing  to  remember  when \nconsidering  person-first  language  is  it  replaces  antiquated  and  offensive \nterminology that has no business in Nevada language. Words do matter. \n \nIn my experience, I can testify that for years I felt like a farm animal being \nherded by doctors, psychiatrists and institutions. They used my diagnosis as \nlabels to push me through to the next provider. These professionals did not start \nto see me as a person until the paradigm changed. Suddenly, I became a person \nwith autism, a person with hearing loss, a person with blindness, a person with \na neurological disorder. My life changed dramatically when professionals began \nto  address  me  about  my  diagnosis  and  not  talk  to  each  other  about  my \ndiagnosis as if I did not exist. It may not seem like it matters to people who \nhave never had to remind others we are in the room, but I can tell you it has \nmade  an  enormous  impact  on  the  quality  of  my  life.  I  am  a  person  with \ndisabilities. \n \nLISA FOSTER (State of Nevada Association of Providers): \nWe support A.B. 430. We partner with the State to provide supportive living \narrangements, jobs and day-training services, and related supportive programs \nthroughout Nevada. This bill moves statute language into the modern vernacular \nfor  individuals  with  intellectual  disabilities  and  brings  Nevada  into  better \nalignment with federal terminology. In section 1, the term used to describe the \ntransition of persons residing in such a facility is being revised to \"appropriate \ncommunity-based setting.\" This is what we now have and what our providers \nand  SNAP  offer  in  partnership  with  the  State;  SNAP  also  appreciates  the \nremoval of obsolete language in section 2 of the bill. Lastly, we support the \nchange in section 3 as it pertains to the goal of the services offered by the \nState  and  its  direct  providers  to  the  term  \"increase  independence.\"  Current \nlanguage is antiquated and not respectful. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 27, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nEDWARD ABLESER (Opportunity Village): \nWe support A.B. 430. The proposed language is moving forward and advancing \nthe causes for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. It also \narticulates  the  demanding  need  for  those  individuals  to  find  and  reside  in \nappropriate community-based settings. We have seen detrimental effects over \nmany  years  that  facilities  are  not  the  place  for  individuals  to  find  a \nperson-centered, meaningful day experience within their day-to-day lives. \n \nDORALEE MARTINEZ (Nevada Action Coalition): \nWe support A.B. 430. We ditto the remarks of the previous callers. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 430 and open the hearing on A.B. 197. \n \nASSEMBLY  BILL  197  (1st  Reprint):  Revises  provisions  relating  to  persons \nexperiencing homelessness. (BDR 11-682) \n \nASSEMBLYMAN HOWARD WATTS (Assembly District No. 15): \nYouth homelessness is a crisis in Nevada. With me today to present this bill are \nArash Ghafoori and Tayvon Jenkins with the Nevada Partnership for Homeless \nYouth (NPHY). I will provide a brief overview of the bill and have submitted my \nwritten remarks (Exhibit H). \n \nARASH GHAFOORI (Executive Director, Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth): \nNevada has one of the highest rates of unaccompanied youth homelessness in \nthe  Country.  Consequently,  increasing  access  to  health  care  for  minors \nexperiencing  homelessness  is  paramount  to  the  health  of  vulnerable  young \npeople  and  the  wellness  of  our  entire  State.  I  have  submitted  my  written \ntestimony (Exhibit I). \n \nTAYVON JENKINS (Youth Ambassador, Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth): \nI was born in Compton, California, and am the eldest of six children. I am a \ngraduate  of  NPHY's  Independent  Living  Program  and  an  official  Youth \nAmbassador. When I was 12 years old, I experienced homelessness for the \nfirst time with my family. After that, my homelessness was off and on due to \nconflict  within  my  family  and  my  mother's  health  problems.  My  written \ntestimony (Exhibit J) has been submitted. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 27, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWhat is the definition of a custodian? \n \nASSEMBLYMAN WATTS: \nThis language came about in conversations with Clark County. When youth \nenter the State and local government systems, these entities are technically not \nguardians  for  the  youth  but  custodians.  This  is  the  definition  referenced  in \nstatute and in the amendment we incorporated in the Assembly. The goal was \nto  include  every  type  of  relationship  between  youth  and  the  caretaker.  It \nincludes parents, guardians and now custodians in those referenced sections. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nOverall, I noticed the bill does everything to protect the caregiver and child. \nSection  1,  paragraph  5  states  \"a  minor  may  not  consent  to  his  or  her \nsterilization.\" It does not address the obviously technical issue of abortion. The \nhomeless child is able to consent to her own abortion, is this correct? \n \nASSEMBLYMAN WATTS: \nLegal opinion was requested about this in the Assembly. I can send the analysis \nto all of you since I do not have it in front of me. Our parental notification laws \non the books are unconstitutional. There is currently no consent requirement. \nThis bill does nothing to move that backward or forward in any way. The bill is \nsilent on this issue partly because other statutes are on the books. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nPlease distribute the legal analysis to the Committee as it will be helpful. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nIf there were a requirement for the NPHY child to get permission from the \nparents, how easy or difficult might it be? I am thinking about the testimony \ngiven by Mr. Jenkins. I am asking if it is feasible. \n \nASSEMBLYMAN WATTS: \nI will turn it over to Mr. Ghafoori to speak to some of the logistical hurdles and \nissues  homeless  youth  experience.  All  we  have  is  a  requirement  stating \nunaccompanied youth must be homeless for four months to access care. We do \nnot provide any guidance on how a provider would make the determination \nbefore rendering care. The whole point of this bill is to take away that time \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 27, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nbarrier and to lay out a clear process to assist both service providers as well as \nhealthcare providers to ensure minors get access to the care they need. \n \nMR. GHAFOORI: \nThere are definitely barriers for youth experiencing homelessness and accessing \nmedical care. With this law, we are introducing a third-party verification we \nhave  used  since  allowed  in  2008,  as  well  as  public  schools  and  other \norganizations in our State, allowing us to easily verify two medical providers. \nThe issue occurs when unaccompanied youth experience medical situations—it \nis difficult for medical providers to honor and accept the law and treat these \nyouth.  Often,  medical  providers  are  afraid  to  do  so  for  fear  of  liability. \nTherefore, this bill cleans this up by adding a third-party verification because \nthat is usually where the issue lies. \n \nYouth accessing care when they are unaccompanied and homeless is a huge \nproblem. We constantly work with the community doing outreach to get youth \nconnected to social workers and case managers. We can advocate and get them \npsychosocial well-being, complete holistic health overview and assessment. We \nalso  help  youth  connect  to  those  resources.  Assembly  Bill 197  will  help \norganizations like ours do this more easily, while also allowing medical providers \nto have a very black-and-white way of verification. This is why the Nevada \nHospital Association is excited and supports A.B. 197. \n \nASSEMBLYMAN WATTS: \nMany situations lead youth to become homeless and unaccompanied. Many, but \nnot all, have left a home environment that was dangerous or unstable. Some \nhave been kicked out of their homes. In either of those situations, even for the \nmost basic medical care, getting in contact with a parent to sign off on health \ncare can be incredibly difficult. We need to have a clear statutory framework \nallowing youth to access medical services without obtaining parental consent \nfirst. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nWhen children leave domestic violence situations, many times they are being \nmolested by parents. In recalling a case in Kentucky, an uncle was molesting a \nyoung  lady  and  she  was  trying  to  get  away  and  wanted  to  tell  someone. \nFour months later they found her in a barn. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 27, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nMS. MAGNUS: \nBattle Born Progress supports A.B. 197. Youth homelessness is a crisis we have \nto  deal  with  in  Nevada,  and  this  bill  is  a  good  step.  Making  it  easier  for \nunaccompanied homeless youth to access health care is crucial in ensuring their \nhealth and safety, especially during a global pandemic when people need health \nservices the most. Ensuring these young people's safety, health and privacy will \nallow our homeless youth to focus on their self-sufficiency and ensure they are \nstaying healthy. As someone who worked in reproductive health care for years, \nI must state it is not the business of the State or any politician to tell anyone \nwith a uterus what they can and cannot do with their health care. When young \npeople are homeless, there are usually serious reasons why, and it can put \nyoung people in danger if they interface with their parent or guardian. For all of \nthese  reasons  and  what  others  have  stated  today,  we  ask  you  to  support \nA.B. 197. \n \nMR. SHEPACK: \nAmerican  Civil  Liberties  Union  of  Nevada  supports  A.B.  197.  Mr.  Jenkins \nsummed it up well. This is an important bill. We need to do everything we can \nto  ensure  our  homeless  youth  have  access  to  all  the  things  they  need  to \nsucceed,  and  health  care  is  at  the  top.  This  bill  is  another  commonsense \nmeasure codifying a solid practice in the law to ensure youth who have faced \ntraumas, which many of us cannot imagine, have access to the health care they \nneed. \n \nPAMELA GIRGIS, APRN, PNP: \nI support A.B. 197. I am a pediatric nurse practitioner and medical provider for \nthe Children's Health Fund and Nevada Health mobile medical van. There are \nmany homeless, sex-trafficked and refugee children in Las Vegas. Since 2018, \nour team has been providing free health care to homeless youth, and we have \npartnered with NPHY. Many of the homeless youth we see on a weekly basis \nare unable to access healthcare services, including behavioral and mental health \nservices, due to restrictions. Many homeless youth have depression and have \nsurvived multiple traumas. They are at a 7.2 times higher risk for committing \nsuicide. Restricting access to care increases the risk of suicide and potential \nharm to these youth. The current restrictions often make youth unable to access \nspecialty  healthcare  services.  Our  team  has  repeatedly  seen  how  this  has \nnegatively  impacted  many  youth  in  need  of  medical  services.  There  are \ncountless stories of the need to treat depression, asthma, diabetes and other \nconditions. This bill will provide youth with hope and a new lease on life. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 27, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nDASHUN JACKSON (Children's Advocacy Alliance): \nWe  support  A.B.  197.  This  bill  is  essential  to  ensure  that  homeless  youth \nreceive the services they so desperately need. \n \nKATIE RYAN (Dignity Health-St. Rose Dominican): \nWe  support  A.B.  197.  We  are  glad  the  oversight  will  be  remedied  by  the \npassage of this bill. \n \nLEANN  MCALLISTER  (Executive  Director,  Nevada  Chapter  of  the  American \nAcademy of Pediatrics): \nWe support A.B. 197. I have submitted our supporting testimony (Exhibit K). \n \nJOANNA JACOB (Clark County): \nWe support A.B. 197. \n \nPATRICIA JULIANELLE (SchoolHouse Connection): \nWe support A.B. 197. I have submitted our supporting testimony (Exhibit L). \n \nMELISSA CLEMENT (Executive Director, Nevada Right to Life): \nI support A.B. 197. I am testifying today as a parent. A parent's heart is broken \nevery time a child is in need. Our homeless youth need to have access to \nmedical procedures as quickly as they can. I encourage this Committee to keep \nparental rights in mind. Will the parent be impacted? Will the child who has a \nloving parent or guardian at home still have that loving adult involved? This is \nmy only concern with this measure. \n \nMARY FECHNER: \nI oppose A.B. 197. I am concerned about minor children who do not have a \nparent or faith relationship and go to a hospital pregnant, wanting to request an \nabortion. My concern for these young girls is that something be available to \nthem for counseling should this situation come up, rather than an immediate \nsituation where they send a young girl to an operating room because she has \nrequested it. I would hope the young children seeking help get counseling for \ntheir mental and physical situation prior to surgery. \n \nALEXIS  TUCEY  (Deputy  Administrator,  Division  of  Child  and  Family  Services, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nWe are testifying in neutral on A.B. 197. We appreciate everyone's support and \nworking through the amendments. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 27, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nASSEMBLYMAN WATTS: \nI distributed to the Committee members and staff the legal opinion related to the \nquestions  brought  up  previously.  In  response  to  the  opposition,  this  bill  is \nnarrowly tailored. The concept youth would somehow use this as a workaround \nwhen  they  have  loving,  supportive  parents  at  home  is  not  acceptable.  The \nstatutory language we have is more broad and vague than this bill about proving \nsomeone has been unaccompanied for four months. I direct all the opposition to \nread section 1, subsection 2 of A.B. 197. It is clear and precise in laying out \nhow youth would demonstrate they have been unaccompanied for four months. \nThe service providers and school staff assigned to homeless youth would help \nthem access this care without consent. This is not a bill about abortion. If there \nis a bill wanting to make a broad parental consent law constitutional, then we \ncan have that debate separately. This bill is about ensuring homeless youth who \nare unaccompanied in this State can get access they need.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI am closing the hearing on A.B. 197. I will now open the hearing on A.B. 399. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 399 (1st Reprint): Revises provisions governing the production \nand sale of eggs and egg products. (BDR 51-559) \n \nASSEMBLYMAN HOWARD WATTS (Assembly District No. 15): \nAssembly  Bill  399  seeks  to  ensure  eggs  produced  or  sold  in  Nevada  meet \ncertain standards of humane treatment for laying hens, often referred to as \ncage-free housing. I have submitted my written presentation (Exhibit M). \n \nWARREN HARDY (Humane Society of the United States): \nThis a happy occasion  when  we get the animal  welfare advocates and the \nindustry  together  to  move  forward  in  a  positive  direction.  This  bill  is  a \ncollaborative effort between the Humane Society of the United States and those \nwho provide egg production for the State. Since the Assembly hearing, we had \nconcerns raised from the Retail Association of Nevada, Chamber of Commerce \nand Nevada Restaurant Association regarding the need for a phased-in approach \nas adopted in the amendment. We addressed their concerns and gained the \nsupport of those organizations. We also had conversations with the Nevada \nCattlemen's  Association  and  Nevada  Farm  Bureau  relating  to  the  small  hen \nfarms and what we define as free-range chickens. We amended the bill with \nprovisions that do not apply to any farms with less than 3,000 hens. This \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 27, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nshould take care of all our small producers in Nevada who provide eggs at \ncounty fairs, farmers markets and those sort of venues. \n \nJEFF DIXON (Nevada State Director, Humane Society of the United States): \nI have submitted my written remarks (Exhibit N) and the proposed amendment \n(Exhibit O). \n \nJIM VAN GORKOM (Senior Vice President, NuCal Foods): \nI have submitted my written remarks (Exhibit P). \n \nJERRY WILKINS (Sales and Marketing Director, Morning Fresh Farms): \nI have submitted my written remarks (Exhibit Q). \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nNo fiscal note implies no significant increase in the need for inspections. Once \nwe have put this in place, how do we know how hens are being treated? \n \nASSEMBLYMAN WATTS: \nWe  worked  with  the  State  Department  of  Agriculture  in  crafting  this  bill, \nintegrating  this  into  existing  procedures  to  guarantee  food  safety,  including \neggs. Whether the producer is physically located here in Nevada or is bringing \nproducts into the State, a procedure is in place. Assembly Bill 399 adds a layer \nby adding an endorsement to the certification that the production of those eggs \nis cage-free. As for inspections, there are various options to have inspections \nprovided in reports to the Department of Agriculture as part of the process. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe earlier heard our State does not have in-State producers which explains why \nwe do not have a fiscal note. How does the interstate commerce piece work, \nand how do we know eggs coming from anywhere in the Country meet these \nstandards? \n \nASSEMBLYMAN WATTS: \nWe have to work within the existing process under the State Department of \nAgriculture.  It  can  be  integrated  into  the  workflow  with  a  number  of \ncertifications on an annual basis. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nHow do we know these eggs are humane when we get them here in Nevada? \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 27, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nMR. VAN GORKOM: \nThere  are  multiple  certifying  agencies  across  the  Country  used  by  egg \nproducers.  We  have  customers  who  require  different  types  of  audits.  The \nprocesses are already in place. For example, one organization called Humane \nFarm Animal Care certifies farms. This is just one of many organizations within \nthe  egg  industry  specifically  for  the  purpose  of  an  audit  trail  and  process \nverification. Any farmer in California or Massachusetts could supply his or her \ncertificate  to  the  State  Department  of  Agriculture  as  documentation  of \ncompliance. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nA lot of work has been done for labeling and public education. Are those the \nsame third-party certification bodies that enable egg producers to put a logo on \ntheir boxes stating the product is pasture-raised, organic or cage-free? Does this \nbill align with those labeling standards? \n \nMR. VAN GORKOM: \nYes.  There  are  many  egg  cartons  or  boxes  in  commerce  with  one  logo  or \nanother. In some cases, it would be the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) \ncertifying a product meets its national organic program requirements. There are \nUSDA definitions for most of these egg types, except for the word \"natural\" \nwhich is vague. These certifying companies and applicable logos, which are \noptional except for the USDA organic circle, could be a way for a consumer or \nbusiness to verify on the package that it meets these standards. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nIn A.B. 399, section 22 states \"Any person who violates any of the provisions \nof sections 1.3 to 22, inclusive, of this act is subject to a civil penalty pursuant \nto NRS 583.700.\" What is the civil penalty, and is it enough to be a deterrent? \n \nASSEMBLYMAN WATTS: \nI  need  to  ask  the  Legal  Division  to  advise  what  the  penalties  are  in  the \nreferenced section. In Chapter 583 of NRS, they are the same penalties for \nviolating  other  parts  of  our  agricultural  statutes,  so  it  is  in  line  with  those \npenalties. We wanted to make sure it was a civil penalty in line with many of \nour criminal justice reform efforts. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 27, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nERIC ROBBINS (Counsel): \nAccording to NRS 583.700, the first violation penalty would be $250, second \nviolation  penalty  would  be  $500,  and  each  subsequent  violation  would  be \n$1,000. \n \nMR. SHEPACK: \nThe  American  Civil  Liberties  Union  of  America  does  not  take  a  position  on \nA.B. 399. However, my big boss, my partner at home, and I both support this \nbill. As egg lovers and members of this fine State, knowing our eggs will always \nbe cage-free is something we look forward to with the passing of this bill. \n \nDOUG BUSSELMAN (Executive Vice President, Nevada Farm Bureau): \nWe oppose A.B. 399. We have been in conversations with Mr. Hardy and the \nHumane  Society  of  the  United  States,  and  they  have  shared  a  conceptual \namendment  with  us  to  provide  an  exemption  for  small  egg  producers.  The \nconversation  has  been  to  remove  the  requirements  from  the  bill  of  an  egg \nproducer who has 3,000 or fewer hens laying eggs. Our opposition has been \nbased on the impacts of Nevada's small backyard and small egg producers. As \nfar as we know, there are no commercial-sized egg producers in Nevada, and \nwe are not aware of any egg producers in the State that use laying cages. This \nlevel  of  3,000  hens  would  fit  the  needs  of  backyard  and  small  farmers  in \nNevada, and they would not be subject to what we view as a burdensome \nrequirement  for  certification.  The  addition  of  the  conceptual  amendment  to \nexempt Nevada egg producers that have 3,000 hens or less would cause us to \nno longer be in opposition to the bill. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIn the Senate and in this Committee, you may testify however you feel most \nauthentically regarding your position on this bill. Given the amendment, would \nyou like to be listed under opposition or support? \n \nMR. BUSSELMAN: \nWith the amendment, we would be in neutral. \n \nALEXANDRIA DAZLICH (Nevada Restaurant Association): \nWe are neutral on A.B. 399. We appreciate the intent of the bill; however, we \nhave concerns. It sets a precedent in mandating consumer choice as well as \nincreasing the price of a staple food. As you are aware, the restaurant industry \nhas been greatly devastated by the pandemic and will need time to recover as \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 27, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nwe continue to operate at limited capacity. Therefore, instituting this level of \nchange in the distribution and supply chain of a staple food will likely have \nnegative effects on our members. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWhat is an omega-3 egg? Is it a real thing, and does it have any higher nutrient \nvalue? \n \nMR. VAN GORKOM: \nYes, it is a real thing. Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown in studies to yield \nhealth benefits. These fatty acids can be added to chicken feed; the hen's body \nabsorbs it and passes along a certain amount into the egg itself. When you see \neggs listed with an omega-3 enhancement, it should also tell you a numerical \nvalue. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDoes this make an omega-3 egg and a pasture-raised egg mutually exclusive \nbecause it has to be done through feed? \n \nMR. VAN GORKOM: \nThey are not exclusive because even a pasture-raised egg is still given regular \nchicken feed to supplement its natural grass diet. Whether the egg is cage-free, \norganic or pasture-raised, theoretically the omega additive could be added to the \nfeed for any of those. \n \nASSEMBLYMAN WATTS: \nThank you, Chair Ratti, for your eggscellent questions! Many major restaurant \nchains  are  moving  in  this  direction,  and  major  gaming  companies  based  in \nNevada have already made this commitment. In listening to the stakeholders, \nwe did create a longer phase in the timeline allowing both the producers and \nthose who are obtaining eggs, especially in commercial enterprises, to do this in \na way that works and does not create any pain. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 399. We have one more item of business with a \nbill  draft  request  (BDR).  We  received  BDR  40-1107  which  needs  to  be \nintroduced. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 27, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nBILL DRAFT REQUEST 40-1107: Creates the Public Health Resource Office. \n(Later introduced as Senate Bill 424.) \n \nI will ask for a motion to introduce BDR 40-1107. \n \n  SENATOR SPEARMAN MOVED TO INTRODUCE BDR 40-1107. \n \n  SENATOR HARRIS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \n  THE MOTION CARRIED.

In \naddition, I will review the “Nevada County Age, Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin \nEstimates and Projections 2000 to 2038 Estimates from 2000 to 2017 and \nProjections from 2018 to 2038” (Exhibit F) and “The 2020 Census in Nevada \nSnapshot #7” (Exhibit G). \n \nExhibit G, available on the legislative website, shows the percentages of the \npopulations who speak English less than very well. The link on Exhibit G will \ntake you to the information. \n \nWe also have a conceptual amendment (Exhibit H). Nevada Revised Statutes \n(NRS) 639.2801  is  the  requirement  for  labeling  containers  for  prescription \ndrugs. This law has nine different components that comprise the label that is \nrequired to be on a prescription drug bottle. \n \nWe  are  asking  that  subsection  6  of  NRS  639.280,  which  is  the  “specific \ndirections  for  use  given  by  the  prescribing  practitioner,”  be  translated  into \nlanguages other than English, and this is what section 1, subsection 1 of the bill \ndoes. The amendment clarifies we are requesting specifically subsection 6. \n \nSection 1, subsection (2), paragraphs (a) and (b) ask for a sign to be posted in a \nconspicuous place in a pharmacy stating the patient has the right to request the \ninformation on the label be printed in a language they speak. A list of languages \nwill be available for them to choose from. \n \nThe State Board of Pharmacy will adopt regulations to carry out the sections of \nthe bill. I referenced the demographers and the U.S. Census Bureau information \nin  my  written  remarks  to  promote  a  good  conversation  among  the  Board \nmembers to say what languages will be translated and what makes the most \nsense for our State. It makes sense to do it county by county, otherwise every \ncounty will have to translate to the Clark County standard. If you are a national \npharmacy doing a lot of programing, it may make sense to set yourself to that \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nhigher standard. If you are only operating in one county, the Board has the \nability to look at each county’s demographics and decide the languages that are \nappropriate for translation. \n \nItem 1 of the conceptual amendment will restore section 1, subsection 5 from \nA.B. 177 as introduced. This is the language regarding liability protections for \npharmacies that use third-party translation services. \n \nWe are asking for additional time for implementation from January 1, 2022, to \nJuly 1, 2022. This will give the time necessary to get the pharmacies ready to \nprovide the translation services. \n \nI have worked in the healthcare sector for a decade and know the difference of \nbeing  in  a  clinical  setting  where  you  have  access  to  translation  services \n24 hours a day. On the back of your badge, you have the number for your \ntranslation  service  when  you  need  to  communicate  with  someone  in  the \nhospital. You would call the number on your badge and have your conversations \ntranslated; this has become a good practice. \n \nWhen you go to a home-based environment, that support goes away. When \npeople  go  to  pick  up  their  medications  and  take  them  into  the  home \nenvironment, they are left without the ability to know what is in the bottle and \nhow to take it. This is why I am asking for this bill to be considered by the \nCommittee. \n \nI have left many homes nervous about a family’s ability to understand what is in \nthose  bottles.  There  are  oftentimes  opioids,  strong  drugs,  fentanyl  patches, \nlorazepam  and  morphine  that  are  prescribed,  and  you  hope  the  family  is \ncommunicating about what is in those bottles and how to take the medication. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThere was an amendment submitted earlier that had only one section and we \nreceived a second amendment, Exhibit H. Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson \nreviewed the additional amendment with us, and this is the correct amendment \nto the bill. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nAre you suggesting the insertion of subsection 6 of NRS 639.2801 so the only \npiece of information required to be translated is the instructions on the label on \nhow to take the medication? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN BENITEZ-THOMPSON: \nThat is correct. We had conversations about the relevant pieces of the label to \nbe translated which would be the instructions on how to take the medication. \nFor  instance,  take  twice  a  day,  three  times  a  day,  morning  and  evening. \nInformation  such  as  the  prescription  serial  number  would  not  need  to  be \ntranslated because they are not as relevant to the patient. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThere are pharmacies who are now providing translation services. Will this be \nenough, or are you requiring any and all languages translated on prescription \nlabels? As a physician, we are required to have a translation service which does \nnot  include  a  family  member.  Are  there  any  other  boards  that  require  this \ninformation in writing? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN BENITEZ-THOMPSON: \nIn the pharmacy setting, pharmacists are required to have verbal translation \nservices for communication purposes. This bill takes over once a person leaves \na pharmacy. The label will have the instructions on how to take the medication \nin  English  and  translated  into  the  language  of  the  person  for  whom  the \nmedication was prescribed. \n \nSenator Hardy, were you asking if there are other licensing boards in the State \nor other pharmacy boards in the Nation requiring translation services? \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nLicensing boards, please. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN BENITEZ-THOMPSON: \nThere  are  no  other  licensing  boards  in  the  State  that  require  the  ability  to \ntranslate. There are other boards nationwide that have the requirement; one is \nOregon.  We  learned  a  lot  from  the  bill  in  Oregon,  but  our  bill  has  taken  a \ndifferent path. California has done it differently, placing the responsibility on \ntheir board. It  has  been a less successful model having the board  translate \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nversus  the  pharmacy.  There  may  be  one  or  two  on  the  municipal  level  in \nNew York that have required the translation of the label. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI have not heard of a physician’s office requiring translated conversations with \npatients. Would this be different in that it would be printed information, not only \ntranslated verbally? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN BENITEZ-THOMPSON: \nThe prescription label only will be required for a written translation. Section 1, \nsubsection (1) of the bill states “upon the request” of the person who can \nrequest the translation from the pharmacy. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWill pharmacies that have a translation service posted have to figure out how to \nprint a label in a different language? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN BENITEZ-THOMPSON: \nThe  translation  services  the  pharmacy  has  are  specific  to  the  employees \ntranslating  to  a  patient  when  they  pick  up  their  medications.  There  is \none pharmacy that has a customer service number you can call, but you need to \nhave an intermediary. When you have someone who is not English proficient \ncalling a number that is English-based, you do not have the intermediary for that \ntranslation to happen. That would not be considered meeting the intent of the \nbill. The intent is the written piece on the label. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nDemographics are important. We have 25 percent to 35 percent of the world \nspeaking more than one language. It is unique to this Country that we require \none language throughout elementary, middle and high school. I can see the \nmerits in this bill. \n \nKATE BALLARD: \nI am a registered nurse in Oregon. I was one of the primary advocates for a \nsimilar Oregon bill, Senate Bill 698 of the Oregon 2019 Regular Session which \npassed and went into effect January 2021. \n \nThe Oregon law came about after nursing students working with patients with \nlimited English proficiency (LEP) noticed a high rate of medication error among \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nthis population. There was a highly educated mother from the Middle East who \nspoke multiple languages: English was not one of them. She could not read the \nlabels on her child’s inhalers and was unintentionally giving him the incorrect \ninhaler  during  an  acute  asthma  attack.  This  child  was  hospitalized  for \nlife-threatening asthma attacks that were unknowingly going untreated. \n \nAfter  this  bill  was  introduced  to  the  Oregon  Legislature,  there  was  an \noutpouring of support. This commonsense legislation resonated with health care \nprofessionals, community organizations and private citizens. The bill was passed \nout of the Senate and House Committees with unanimous bipartisan support. \n \nIn one physician’s testimony, he said “the only difference between a medicine \nand poison is understanding how to use it.” \n \nCurrent  practices  are  not  enough.  Language  services  among  pharmacies  are \nvariable and most do not provide any translated written materials. It is important \nto note that verbal interpretation alone is not enough. It is not realistic to expect \na patient to memorize the instructions for multiple medications after a single \nreview session at a pharmacy counter. \n \nPeer  reviewed  studies  and  legislative  testimony  document  the  danger  of \nproviding patients with English only prescription labels. Patients with LEP are \ntwice as likely to experience medication errors than English speaking patients. In \na study that tested the use of optimized translated prescription labels, patients \nwith LEP taking multiple drugs per day were significantly more likely to take the \ncorrect dosages when provided with these labels. \n \nCase  studies  have  also  documented  medication  errors.  An  infant  was \nhospitalized after her parents, who could not read the English instructions, gave \nher  12  times  the  intended  dose  of  liquid  iron.  A  survey  of  120  Wisconsin \npharmacies published by the American Academy of Pediatrics show more than \nhalf  reported  never,  or  sometimes,  providing  translated  prescription  labels. \nApproximately  two-thirds  of  the  pharmacies  reported  never,  or  sometimes, \ncommunicating verbally with patients with LEP. \n \nWhat do we need to understand about the cost of compliance? A large portion \nof the cost projected by chain pharmacies are front-loaded costs to integrate the \ntranslation  software  into  their  complex  systems.  Since  the  passage  of \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nNew York’s law in 2012, followed by California and Oregon, chain pharmacies \nhave had the time and legal imperative to integrate their translation software. \n \nCost to pharmacies will vary depending on their size and the software they \nhave.  It  cost  one  large  hospital  system  in  Oregon  $25,000  to  translate \n1,000 instructions into 14 languages. \n \nIn analyzing the financial impacts of A.B. 177, it is important to consider the \nsignificant  cost  savings  this  bill  would  bring.  The  average  cost  of  a  single \nhospitalization for a medication error is $15,000, which totals in the billions of \ndollars nationally each year. We do not know what percentage of those billions \nof  dollars  are  related  to  language  barriers  because  those  numbers  are  not \ntracked.  However,  experts  on  healthcare  economics  agree  that  costs  from \nlanguage-related medication errors will continue to increase over time unless \nhealthcare providers meet demands for improved translation services. \n \nHow do we know translated prescription labels are safe? Certified translation \ncompanies  use  a  rigorous  multi-step  vetting  process  in  their  translation  of \nprescription labels. The risk of a medication error is far lower than sending an \nLEP patient home with a bottle in English they cannot read or understand. \n \nWhy is it important to have both English and the translated language on the \nlabel?  Dual  language  labels  ensure  both  patients  with  LEP  and  their  English \nspeaking pharmacist, caregivers and providers know what the prescription label \nsays.  An  example  of  the  label  would  have  the  instructional  phrase  “take \none tablet by mouth daily” and would be translated. Both the English and the \ntranslation would be on the label. \n \nWill there be enough space on the bottle for both languages? In most situations, \nyes. However, there are several options to address uncommon instances where \nextra room is needed, including pull-out tabs or folding a second label in half and \nplacing  it  on  the  bottle.  This  is  a  common  practice  pharmacies  use  called \n“flagging.” \n \nWhy is it not sufficient to give a patient the translation on a separate piece of \npaper, rather than on the label? The reality is that many patients have upwards \nof  five  medications,  plus  children  with  medications  of  their  own.  It  is  not \nrealistic to expect a patient to keep track of five plus instruction packets and \nthen match the correct packet with the correct medication. If the translated \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \ninstructions are not on the bottle, the safety of Nevadans will continue to be at \nrisk. \n \nWhat  has  Oregon  learned  since  the  passage  of  its  law?  The  effective  date \nwritten in the law was January 2, 2021. The pandemic hit and everything froze. \nPharmacies  are  in  an  informal  grace  period  to  account  for  pandemic-related \ndelays. Until the Board of Pharmacy can safely resume inspections, we do not \nhave data on overall compliance; however, we do know that many pharmacies \nare having early success with this law. \n \nPharmacists have a code of ethics that requires them to communicate with \npatients in terms that are understandable and to respect personal and cultural \ndifferences among patients. Assembly Bill 177 enables pharmacists to meet \ntheir ethical requirements. \n \nBARRY GOLD (AARP): \nLifesaving prescription drugs do not work if you cannot afford them. Equally, \nyou can say lifesaving prescription drugs do not work if you do not know how \nto take them. People and their families need to understand how to take the \nmedicine they are prescribed to have positive health outcomes. For example, are \nyou supposed to take one of these once a day or two of these four times a day? \nThis is a big difference that would change the outcome. For these reasons, and \nthe fact that this is a simple solution to a big problem, AARP supports A.B. 177. \n \nERIC JENG (Asian Community Development Council): \nI will read from the written testimony provided by Carlo Miciano (Exhibit I) in \nsupport of A.B. 177. \n \nJOY AVENDANO (Asian Community Development Council): \nThere  are  68,000  LEP  households  across  the  State.  The  Asian  Community \nDevelopment Council is a partner of Nevada Health Link, and we have bilingual \nstaff in Tagalog, Vietnamese, Chinese, Spanish and Korean. Members of the \nFilipino  community  prefer  reaching  out  to  Filipino  doctors.  It  is  difficult  to \nunderstand some grammar in medical terms. Having English and Filipino printed \non  the  label  of  the  bottle  would  be  beneficial  since  many  Filipinos  have \nhouseholds with English and mixed language proficiency. The availability of both \nlanguages would mean Filipinos could easily double-check instructions and will \nnot need to keep booklets provided with the medication which can get lost. \nTheir confidence when navigating medical terms will increase. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nMAYA HOLMES (Culinary Health Fund): \nThe Culinary Health Fund is a nonprofit labor management trust that provides \nhealth  benefits  for  60,000  culinary  union  workers  and  their  dependents; \napproximately 125,000 lives. We operate two free pharmacies for our members \nand their dependents. One is located across from the Stratosphere Hotel, and \nthe other is at the intersection of Nellis and Lamb in Las Vegas. Our culinary \nhealth  center  is  within  a  five-mile  radius  of  approximately  40,000  of  our \nmembers. The membership of the culinary union is diverse and members hail \nfrom all corners of the globe. \n \nOur priority is ensuring access to high-quality affordable care in Nevada. Over \nthe years, we have worked on many pieces of legislation to address the high \ncost of prescription drugs and access to those drugs. Our pharmacies are part of \nthat  effort.  We  call  them  free  pharmacies  because  at  our  pharmacies  our \nmembers  have no copays for their prescriptions. Our nonprofit pharmacy at \nNellis is one of the busiest in the State having sold over 30,000 prescriptions in \nMarch. \n \nWe  support  A.B.  177  and  appreciate  Assemblywoman  Benitez-Thompson’s \nwork with us to address our concerns on the bill. We need to review the revised \nconceptual  amendment,  Exhibit  H,  regarding  the  focus  on  subsection  6  of \nNRS 639.2801 but believe this is an important piece of legislation that will \nensure patients have access to language translation for their prescriptions. \n \nELIZABETH MACMENAMIN (Retail Association of Nevada): \nThe Retail Association of Nevada supports A.B. 177. Because Nevada has such \na diverse population, this bill as amended, will create an added layer of safe \nmedication for LEP individuals and/or any patients in Nevada. Pharmacies and \npublic health officials have a strong history of reaching mutual public health \ngoals  together,  as  we  saw  during  the  recent  pandemic.  We  appreciate  the \nsponsor adding back the third-party liability to the language and protecting our \npharmacists going forward. We also appreciate limiting the translation of the \ndirections to use the medication, as this is the most important part on the \nprescription label. This will increase medication adherence. \n \nGILLIAN BLOCK (Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers): \nThe Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers supports A.B. 177 because we \nsupport  efforts  to  make  prescription  drug  labeling  more  accessible  to  the \ncommunity members we serve who oftentimes primarily speak a language other \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nthan  English.  This  bill  aligns  with  our  consumer  protection  goals  to  ensure \npeople have meaningful access to the important information needed to make \ncritical decisions and protect their health. \n \nCHRISTINE SAUNDERS (Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada): \nThe Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada supports Assembly Bill 177 as a \nsimple  solution  that  will  address  a  discriminatory  practice  leaving  many \nNevadans unprotected at a time when they are most vulnerable. It will provide \nvital steps to safeguard patients, reduce long-term costs and provide language \njustice for Nevadans. \n \nJOELLE GUTMAN DODSON (Washoe County Health District): \nThe Washoe County Health District supports A.B. 177. Prescription directions \nwritten in the proficient language for the prescribed patient is a patient-centered \nand public safety commonsense practice. Taking a prescription incorrectly due \nto LEP is dangerous and could be fatal. Additionally, medication administration \nmistakes can be an unnecessary cost to our healthcare system. \n \nLALO MONTOYA (Make the Road Nevada): \nMake the Road Nevada supports A.B. 177. We are a nonprofit organization that \ngives voices to immigrants and working-class Nevadans committed to organizing \ntomorrow’s  leaders  to  become  advocates  for  their  families.  We  feel  this  a \ncritical step to ensure healthcare parity for all Nevadans and brings the equity \nneeded for Nevadans with LEP. \n \nNevada has the highest per capita immigration population, which has nearly \ndoubled in the last 20 years. We have seen first-hand the diverse population of \nthe immigrant community hailing from Latin America, Asia, Europe and Africa. \nAccording to a new American economy of Nevada report, immigrants make up \n30  percent  of  entrepreneurs  in  Nevada,  with  immigrant  owned  businesses \ngenerating nearly $800 million in business, employing over 60,000 people. It is \nsafe to say that immigrants are an essential piece of the fabric of our State. \nAbout 250,000 LEP Nevadans speak Spanish as their first language and cannot \nread the directions for their prescription medication. \n \nAssembly  Bill  177  will  support  the  Latino  and  immigrant  communities  by \ntranslating their prescriptions into Spanish. As a young boy, I had to translate \nevery piece of documentation for my parents. As I got older, I realized no child \nshould have to bear that responsibility. No child should have to wing it, or \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nattempt  to  translate  a  critical  piece  of  information  like  medical  bills  or \nprescription  medications.  This  is  an  important  opportunity  to  advocate  for \nlanguage justice in Nevada. \n \nJAMIE COGBURN (Nevada Justice Association): \nIn principal, this bill is a good idea, but the Nevada Justice Association opposes \nA.B. 177.  We  have  a  concern  with  the  conceptual  amendment,  Exhibit H, \npresented this afternoon. It provides immunity to the pharmacy if the translation \nby the third party is not done correctly and may lead to medication errors. Our \nbiggest concern is who the translation company is. If it is a company out of \nChina, or India or another foreign country, or they are not insured; there is no \nramification or responsibility for anyone who has made an error. A pharmacy \ncan hire another company and have immunity, leaving the person who is hurt by \nthe negligence of the translation with no repercussions. \n \nMARIA-TERESA LIEBERMANN-PARRAGA (Battle Born Progress): \nBattle Born Progress supports A.B. 177. I grew up in a non-English speaking \nhousehold. This will help people like my mother, who is not as proficient in \nEnglish as I am. I found myself in situations when after surgery, I could not \nclearly understand what my prescriptions were. I needed to have a friend with \nme in case my mother did not understand. Not everyone has someone outside \nthe family who speaks English well enough to help out in situations such as \nthis. This will help everyone in a family who is not English proficient or has \nmixed proficiency. \n \nMELANIE KELLY (Safeway Pharmacy): \nI am a Nevada licensed pharmacist working in Sparks. I work for Albertsons \nCompanies  which  operate  36  pharmacies  in  Nevada  under  the  Albertsons, \nSafeway and Vons banner. Assembly Bill 177 addresses the needs of patients \nwith LEP; however, in its current state, it overlooks the needs of a pharmacist \nto be protected in the event errors occur in translation. Third-party companies, \nwith  the  translation  technology  and  expertise,  will  be  vital  in  ensuring  the \ndirections can be translated into the necessary language for the patient. As a \npharmacist, I will not be able to verify with certainty the translation is accurate, \nand will have to rely on the expertise of a third-party translation company. For \nthis  reason,  it  is  imperative  the  language  which  was  amended  out  of  the \nintroduced bill be added back into law. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nPlease consider adding back the language from subsection 5 to give pharmacists \nprotection  as  they  rely  on  third-party  companies  to  translate  the  directions \nwhich appear on the prescription label. This language reads: \n \nIf a pharmacy enters into a  contract  with a third party for the \ntranslation  of  the  information  that  the  pharmacy  is  required  to \nprovide pursuant to this section, the pharmacy and any employee \nof the pharmacy are not liable in any civil action for any injury \nresulting from the translation by the third party which is not the \nresult of negligence, recklessness or deliberate misconduct of the \npharmacy or employee. \n \nAdditionally, I would ask that the effective date of this law be changed to \none year after the Board of Pharmacy completes the rulemaking process. This \nwill ensure there is adequate time for necessary testing and implementation \nonce the full set of languages has been established. \n \nDORALEE MARTINEZ (Nevada Action Coalition): \nThe Nevada Action Coalition supports A.B. 177. \n \nPAUL MORADKHAN (Vegas Chamber): \nThe Vegas Chamber was originally opposed to A.B. 177. Based on the latest \nconceptual  amendment,  Exhibit  H,  the  Vegas  Chamber  is  now  neutral  on \nA.B. 177 because of the restoration of section 1, subsection 5, and change to \nthe implementation date. We are neutral now because of concerns about the \ncost to pharmacies. \n \nCYRUS HOJJATY: \nI appreciate the efforts to improve public health and the stability of individuals; \nhowever, I have some concerns. This brings the incentive that people will not \nlearn English. There are many private services, such as Google Translate, that \ncan help with translation. I am also concerned this will increase the cost of \ndoing business. \n \nThe  high  immigrant  population  mentioned  earlier  does  not  take  into \nconsideration that many people are not citizens and are here illegally. Why are \nwe having such population dynamics, and what benefits are we getting out of \nthis? How do we know these trends will continue? Being a minority does not \nmean you have LEP. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nNICK VANDER POEL (Reno + Sparks Chamber of Commerce): \nI echo the remarks made by my colleague from the Vegas Chamber in support \nof A.B. 177. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN BENITEZ-THOMPSON: \nI want to thank the pharmacists from the spectrum of pharmacy who took time \nto talk with me. It has been a long road but a road where there was dialogue \nand purposeful thought by everyone involved. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 177 and open the hearing on A.B. 181. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 181 (1st Reprint): Revises provisions relating to mental health. \n(BDR 40-522) \n \nWe  just  received  a  new  proposed  conceptual  amendment  (Exhibit  J)  from \nAssemblywoman Peters, with the purpose of clarifying the providers that must \nreport, and what data must be reported to the Chief Medical Officer. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN SARAH PETERS (Assembly District No. 24): \nThis bill came to me in two parts from separate parties with different interests. I \nsaw the potential to create what looked like a cornerstone of data collection in \nan underrepresented area of health care. \n \nThe first part of the bill deals with suicide data collection related to mental \nhealthcare  issues.  The  second  part  is  related  to  mental  health  parity.  The \npurpose  of  this  bill  is  to  focus  on  people;  the  patients  in  need  of  services \nprovided by both sides of this healthcare equation. \n \nThere is no one who can say that suicide is not a concern in Nevada. We have \nconsistently  been  identified  as  having  some  of  the  highest  rates  of  suicide \namong most demographics reported, including vulnerable populations such as \nveterans, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer youth and others. Data on \ncompleted suicides show we are too late with providing intervention services. \n \nThe  first  part  of  this  bill  proposes  collecting  data  prior  to  suicide  through \nattempts  at  identifying  people  and  patients  who  need  help  today. \nStephanie Woodard will go over the first part of the bill that was brought to me \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nby the Division of Public and Behavioral Health (DPBH) of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services (DHHS). \n \nSTEPHANIE WOODARD, Psy.D. (Senior Advisor on Behavioral Health, Division of \nPublic and Behavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services): \nWe have worked a long time, primarily on fatality data, recognizing the best \npractices supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \nand other national organizations that prioritize prevention of suicide. We need \nthe  data  to  understand  the  magnitude  of  the  issue  so  we  have  ample \nopportunity  to  intervene.  By  collecting  information  on  suicide  attempts  and \nintentional self-harm, and having that information reported to the DPBH, we will \nbe better armed to develop responsive prevention and intervention strategies \nand expand our postvention support. \n \nThis data supports our efforts to bring zero suicide in Nevada to scale. We \ncannot change what it is that we cannot see. We believe collecting this data \nwill help us shine a light on suicide and ultimately save lives. \n \nAn important part of this bill requires the DPBH to develop regulations specific \nto the reporting of suicide attempts and intentional self-harm. These regulations \nwould be promulgated through the DPBH and approved through the State Board \nof Health. We are seeking to collect a very minimum data set, which would \nallow  us  to  understand  the  frequency  in  which  suicide  attempts  are  being \ntreated in emergency rooms and inpatient settings. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS:  \nThe proposed conceptual amendment, Exhibit J, clarifies the legislative intent of \nsections  6.2,  6.4,  6.6  and  6.8.  We  wanted  to  work  with  stakeholders  on \nclarifying that this data is intended to come from providers of health care in a \nmedical facility or the medical facility itself. This helps to alleviate the pressure \non  our  small  doctor’s  offices  or  general  practitioners  who  may  hear  about \npeople’s feelings but not necessarily become problematic in the intended suicide \ntrack. \n \nThe second part of the bill deals with patient coverage for health insurance. The \nfederal  government  requires  compliance  for  the  Paul  Wellstone  and \nPete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008. This is \nmentioned in our statutes. However, there is a lack of clarity in the health and \ninsurance industry as to what parity metrics are. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nWe are not proposing a prescription to remedy this parity ambiguity today. We \nare requesting the Division of Insurance (DOI) have the authority to proactively \nreview parity metrics from insurance providers in Nevada to determine what the \nbaseline of parity is. The State process for assessing parity starts on the backs \nof our vulnerable populations who have felt their right to parity of services has \nbeen violated. These individuals have to submit a complaint with supporting \nevidence to the DOI for review of their case. This is done when a patient learns \nthe  services  they  seek  are  not  being  covered  and  not  accessible  for  their \nimmediate needs. This bill requests this activity be completed proactively rather \nthan on the backs of patients already in need of support. \n \nThere  is  recent  federal  legislation  that  has  passed  related  to  the  reporting \nrequirements of insurance companies related to this Parity Act. We have been \nworking with the DOI and other stakeholders to ensure the language in this bill \nallows  the  DOI  to  incorporate  those  federal  requirements  while  meeting  the \ndesired parity outcomes proposed through the adoption of this bill. \n \nFinally,  bringing  the  two  pieces  of  this  bill  together,  we  have  included \nrequirements that the data collected by both the DPBH and DOI be prepared in \nreports  and  provided  to  the  Patient  Protection  Commission  for  their \nconsideration in assessing access and coverage for mental and behavioral health \nservices in Nevada. \n \nLEA CASE (Nevada Psychiatric Association): \nI will walk through section 9 of the bill, if necessary, which requires the parity \nreport being submitted to the DOI. I also have background on the federal Parity \nAct if there are any questions. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nAs I understand it, the reporting requirements require a physician to report an \nattempted  suicide.  I  am  not  sure  how  that  works  with  the  concept  of \nconfidentiality. \n \nDR. WOODARD: \nLike all data that is collected through the DPBH, we have some of the highest \nstandards related to confidentiality. We are mirroring the language after the \nlanguage that was developed as part of the overdose reporting requirements \nestablished in A. B. No. 474 of the 79th Session. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nThere is not a lot of detail in the legislation because we intend to provide more \ngranular information related to what will be reported and who will be reporting \nand under what circumstances through the regulatory process. Our intent is to \nnot  be  broad  with  the  implementation  of  this  bill.  We  do  want  to  bring \nstakeholders forward in the development of regulations to ensure we have their \nvoices heard. We will continue to hold confidentiality of patient personal health \ninformation  in  the  highest  regard  and  continue  to  provide  the  necessary \nprotections for that data. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIf a doctor has learned someone has attempted suicide, what does he do? What \nis the burden on the physician? Is the information reported for data collection \nonly to keep a count of the number of attempted suicides? \n \nDR. WOODARD: \nWe  are  able  to  collect  some  of  this  data  through  billing  and  claims  data; \nhowever, the problem we have is the billing and claims data has a lag, and most \nof  that  data  goes  through  a  considerable  process.  Based  on  the  billing  and \nclaims data for 2020, there were just over 866,000 emergency room visits of \nwhich 1,300 were identified as suicide attempts. \n \nWe have other mechanisms we can use to have a sense of what is happening \nthrough  syndrome  surveillance.  Unfortunately,  we  do  not  have  all  hospitals \nreporting through this surveillance. While it is good at helping us to detect, the \naccuracy is not there. \n \nWe  felt  having  this  timely  data  would  assist  us  in  gathering  the  necessary \ninformation as we are starting to see surges in any one geographic area or \nwithin  a  hospital  related  to  the  amount  of  suicide  attempts  being  reported. \nUltimately, this can help us understand what the need is for getting individuals \nthe help they need for postvention and continued efforts for suicide prevention. \nThis  data  can  also  be  helpful  to  the  hospitals  reporting  it,  especially  those \nworking to implement the zero suicide initiative. Being able to package this data \nand provide it back to hospitals so they have their own data to understand how \nfrequently this is occurring will help them in those efforts. We do not intend \nthat outpatient providers would be reporting this information. We are looking for \ninformation provided through hospitals and providers in those hospitals. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nWe have three different methods that the overdose reporting is being provided \nto us depending on what the hospital chooses as a method. The first is via fax \nand the second is through data extract. Hospitals have been able to develop a \nbatch data extract they can transmit to the DPBH or through an electronic form. \nWe have looked into augmenting that electronic form with two data fields that \nwould need to be changed to operationalize it. We have the ability to do this to \nsupport the implementation of this legislation. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nAre only hospitals going to be required to report this information? \n \nDR. WOODARD: \nAt  this  point,  it  would  only  be  hospitals.  As  we  start  to  build  out  crisis \nstabilization centers, there is a possibility we would need to expand, through \nregulation,  the  reach  to  crisis  stabilization  centers  knowing  we  may  have \nindividuals presenting for care in those settings. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nNevada Revised Statutes 441A.220 could include the crisis centers? \n \nDR. WOODARD: \nYes, through the regulatory development process. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe intent of the bill is to capture data upon an initial suicide attempt. A doctor \ncould be treating someone in a hospital and discover they may have attempted \nsuicide a week ago or a month ago. What prevents dual reporting? \n \nDR. WOODARD: \nThrough the regulatory process, we intend to clarify this would be at the point \nof care where someone was receiving care for a suicide attempt or intentional \nself-harm. That would be done through specific ICD-10 codes. A provider would \nhave to determine if the individual met criteria for those diagnoses, and those \ndiagnoses would be reported through this mechanism. \n \nWe would hope the information would come from a point of care where the \npatient is receiving care at the time of the incident so we could alleviate dual \nreporting. Through our data cleansing mechanisms, we can also try to mitigate \nany dual reporting. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nDoes the second half of the bill with regard to parity refer to the parity for \nmental health and addiction? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS: \nThe data collected would be modeled after the federal legislation and those \nrequirements. We would not be requesting that insurance companies duplicate \ntheir  reporting  or  provide  more  information  than  they  are  required  to  report \nfederally. It would include mental, behavioral and addiction metrics. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nAre you looking for data on someone being treated for an appendix removal at \none hospital that could have had this procedure at a different hospital, or is it \nfor mental health and addiction parity? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS: \nThis is specifically related to the types of coverage regulated under the Mental \nHealth Parity and Addiction Equity Act. \n \nJESSICA FERRATO (American College of Emergency Physicians, Nevada Chapter): \nThe  American  College  of  Emergency  Physicians  supports  A.B.  181.  We  are \nseeing an increase of attempted suicides in our emergency rooms, in particular, \nat a frightening rate. This is mostly due to the pandemic and some of the mental \nhealth  challenges  in  homes  with  children,  specifically  in  Washoe  and \nClark Counties. \n \nTREY DELAP (National Alliance on Mental Illness Nevada): \nI will read from written testimony (Exhibit K) in support of A.B. 181. \n \nTOM CLARK (Nevada Association of Health Plans): \nThe Nevada Association of Health Plans is neutral on A.B. 181. We would like \nto thank Assemblywoman Peters for working with us on section 9 of the bill \ndealing with the reporting of information on mental health parity. \n \nBARBARA RICHARDSON (Commissioner of Insurance, Department of Business and \nIndustry): \nThe Department of Business and Industry is neutral on A.B. 181. We echo the \nsupport from others and appreciate a positive vote. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 181 and open the hearing on A.B. 178. \n \nASSEMBLY  BILL  178:  Revises  provisions  relating  to  prescription  drugs. \n(BDR 57-71) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN MELISSA HARDY (Assembly District No. 22): \nI would like to present A.B. 178 which ensures Nevadans have access to their \nprescription medications during a state of emergency or declaration of disaster. \n \nThe Covid-19 pandemic highlights the need to reconsider the rules that limit \naccess to needed prescription drugs for Nevadans such as older adults and \npeople with underlying health conditions during a declared state of emergency \nor disaster. \n \nInsurance  companies  generally  impose  strict  limits  on  the  frequency  of \nmedication refills. Outside of times of crisis, there are valid reasons insurance \ncompanies limit when and how much of certain medications people can obtain \nat  one  time.  They  could  be  misused,  misplaced  or  even  sold  on  the  black \nmarket. Therefore, many people obtain a one-month supply of medicine, which \nworks well for them. \n \nOver a year ago, to facilitate the State’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, \nGovernor Steve Sisolak declared a state of emergency. Nevadans were asked to \nlimit nonessential activities due to the pandemic and were encouraged to limit \ntheir  trips  outside  their  homes  to  gather  essential  items  such  as  food  and \nprescription medications to stay safe and healthy. \n \nDuring this time, the CDC encouraged those at higher risk, particularly older \nadults and those with underlying health conditions, to have at least a 30-day \nsupply  of  prescription  drugs  and  talk  to  a  healthcare  provider,  insurer  or \npharmacist about obtaining an extra supply of their prescriptions, if possible, to \nreduce their trips to a pharmacy. \n \nThis bill came from a personal experience with my mother in a situation early in \nthe shutdown. She needed some of her medications refilled and, at first, was \nunable  to  go  to  the  doctor  as  they  were  not  seeing  patients  during  the \npandemic. Because of the risk with her health, she did not want to go to the \ndoctor or to a lab. She is self-sufficient and takes care of everything herself, but \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nin this case, it took some time and jumping through hoops on my part to help \nher get her medications refilled. From that experience came the desire to bring \nthis legislation forward. \n \nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, people needed easy access to their medications \nwhich was difficult during times of social distancing and their inability to meet \nwith healthcare practitioners. States throughout the Country have addressed \nprescription medication refills in times of natural disasters or a declared state of \nemergency. At least eight states including Arizona, California, Florida, Maryland, \nOklahoma,  South  Carolina,  Texas  and  Washington  allow  pharmacists  to \ndispense early, and/or provide emergency refills of a prescription under certain \ncircumstances. \n \nAssembly Bill 178 requires insurers, including Medicaid, the Public Employees’ \nBenefits Program (PEBP) and local governments that provide coverage for their \nemployees to:  \n \nWaive  any  restrictions  on  the  time  period  within  which  a \nprescription may be refilled for an insured who resides in the area \nto which a state of emergency or declaration of disaster applies if \nthe insured requests the refill within a certain time; and authorize \npayment  for  a  supply  of  a  covered  prescription  drug  for  up  to \n30 days  for  any  insured  who  requests  a  refill  under  those \nconditions. \n \nThe  Commissioner  of  Insurance  may  extend  the  time  periods  as  he  or  she \ndetermines necessary. \n \nTo  respond  effectively  to  urgent  demands  during  a  state  of  emergency  or \nnatural  disaster,  the  public  may  need  increased  access  to  therapeutic \npharmaceuticals.  Meeting  this  need  requires  safely  expanding  access  to \npharmacy  services  and  providing  temporary  and  limited  relief  from  certain \nregulatory restrictions to enhance operational capacity, flexibility and efficiency \noperations. \n \nA pharmacist may refill a prescription only for the number of times authorized, \nor for the number of times authorized by the prescribing practitioner. This bill \ncreates an exception to this rule to allow: \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \n[A] pharmacist to fill or refill a prescription in an amount that is \ngreater than the amount authorized by the prescribing practitioner \nbut does not exceed a 30-day supply of the drug if: the drug is not \na controlled substance listed in schedule II; the patient lives in an \narea where a state of emergency or disaster applies; and the drug \nis  necessary  for  the  patient’s  maintenance  of  life  or  the \ncontinuation of therapy for a chronic condition and interruption of \ntherapy using the drug may be detrimental to the person’s health or \nproduce physical or mental discomfort. \n \nA pharmacist who dispenses drugs under these conditions is required to issue \nand maintain a written order for dispensing the drug and notify the prescribing \npractitioner. \n \nThe fiscal notes from the Department of Business and Industry, DHHS and PEBP \nare on the legislative website, and the State Board of Pharmacy indicates there \nis no fiscal impact. Most of the local governments also note there is no fiscal \nimpact. \n \nAssembly Bill 178 helps people to maintain a continuous supply of medications \nduring a declared state of emergency or disaster. The bill requires an insurer to \nwaive restrictions on medication refills during a declared state of emergency and \nauthorizes payment for a supply of the prescription drug for up to 30 days. \n \nThe measure also authorizes a pharmacist to fill or refill a prescription drug to a \nperson living in an area that is declared a disaster or state of emergency in an \namount greater than is authorized by a prescribing practitioner but does not \nexceed a 30-day supply of the drug under certain circumstances. \n \nI have reached out to and been working with stakeholders to get their input and \ncontinue to make every effort to find solutions to any concerns. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWas there thought given to continuing drugs such as buprenorphine which is \nused to treat someone who has had an addiction to opioids? If we do not, we \nrun the risk of them getting back on opioids. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \nDAVE WUEST (State Board of Pharmacy): \nThe law would allow that as a Schedule III drug. The only restriction would be \nSchedule II drugs. If the pharmacist made the determination that it was in the \nbest interest of the patient, the law would allow that. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN HARDY: \nThis  bill  will  give  peace  of  mind  and  reassurance  to  Nevadans  relying  on \nmedications, knowing they will have access to those medications if we are ever \nin a state of emergency or disaster. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 178 and open the hearing on A.B. 228. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 228 (1st Reprint): Establishes provisions relating to children's \nadvocacy centers. (BDR 38-358) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN BRITTNEY MILLER (Assembly District No. 5): \nI am here today to present A.B. 228. It is traumatic for a child to experience \nabuse and neglect. It can cause lifetime harm to children, their families and \ncommunities.  Many  children  who  experience  maltreatment  are  pulled  into  a \nsystem that requires them to relive the trauma over and over as they have to \nshare their story with law enforcement, child protective services, caseworkers, \nlawyers, investigators and judges. \n \nThis bill provides children who have experienced abuse or neglect a faith and \nchild-focused  environment.  The  bill  requires  State  and  county  child  welfare \nagencies to ensure children who are the victims of abuse or neglect have access \nto a multidisciplinary team (MDT) through a children’s advocacy center (CAC). \nThese  teams  include  professionals  with  backgrounds  in  criminal  justice,  law \nenforcement, child protective services, mental health, and medical and victim \nadvocacy to help children heal from the trauma of abuse or neglect. \n \nCHERYL  COOLEY  (Southern  Nevada  Children’s  Advocacy  Center;  Children’s \nAdvocacy Centers of Nevada): \nThis  bill  legitimizes  and  brings  attention  to  a  multidisciplinary  approach  to \ndealing with child abuse. A lot of our forensic interviews surround children who \nhave been sexually abused. When a child makes an outcry of sexual abuse to \ntheir teacher, for instance, they are letting out the biggest family secret their \nfamily has, and the offenders have tried to keep it quiet. When you have to talk \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \nto a teacher, then a principal, then the police, then child protective services, \nthen  a  doctor,  you  are  losing  traction  with  what  is  happening,  often  in  a \nnegative way. \n \nThe Children’s Advocacy Center brings the child to a CAC where they have a \nforensic interview, a research-based, child-led interview. This is so the children \ncan tell their story of abuse in their own words. We do not want to lead or \ninfluence  the  children  in  any  way.  A  child  can  go  to  a  CAC  and  get  the \nadvocacy and support they need after they disclose such a big secret. \n \nI will now play video testimony from a young college student, Lexi, who has \ngone through that process which can be seen on YouTube on the following link: \n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?tv=rOox5bQkUq>. \n \nJESSE HAW (Children's Advocacy Centers of Nevada): \nLexi is not alone. One out of four girls and one out of six boys nationwide will \nhave something like this happen to them by the time they are 18 years of age. \nMoving towards this legislation, Nevada will join 34 other states who have gone \nto best practices and MDTs like the CAC. We did not create this model; we \nresearched the Country to figure out which was the best. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIf we have four existing CACs in Nevada, why is it important we make it a law \nthat we have CACs? \n \nMR. HAW: \nTwo  of  the  CACs  are  accredited  by  the  National  Children’s  Alliance  (NCA) \nstandards. This bill will set out what the guidance for the CAC is, which will \nchange over time, and the NCA will help guide us on what the most up-to-date \npractices are. \n \nWe have two CACs rising to get that accreditation, which is a long, tough \nprocess. A lot of people will not donate to these types of programs because if it \nis not in statute, they are not sure it is a legitimate program. Having a defined \nlegitimate CAC helps us fundraise and operate them. It determines that best \npractices will be followed; that you will not have someone starting one up that \nis not following what will hopefully be the law. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 27 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI want to ensure you have done extensive research and taken a good look at the \nlanguage set out in NRS to make sure it matches the standard, and that we are \nnot doing anything that will disrupt the work of the current CACs. \n \nMR. HAW: \nWe have had great cooperation with many departments in the north and the \nsouth because it does touch on things from police to district attorneys and is all \nencompassing. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe NCA is a single organization. Are there competing organizations that do the \nsame work? Are we picking one versus another; is it restrictive in any way? \n \nPEG SAMPLES (Washoe County Child Advocacy Center): \nThere  are  other  nonprofit  organizations  that  work  with  CACs  across  the \nCountry. The NCA is the largest and most widely recognized accrediting agency \nin the Country. \n \nJOANNA JACOB (Clark County): \nClark County supports A.B. 228 because it has real-world impacts. It is rare this \nSession that I get to talk about the good things in Clark County child welfare, \nand this is one of them. It is difficult to watch the video of Lexi and not know \nabout the good work that the Clark County Department of Family Services does, \nand our southern Nevada CAC does every day. \n \nNEYDA BECKER (Children’s Advocacy Center Foundation): \nThe  Children’s  Advocacy  Center  Foundation  (CACF)  supports  A.B.  228. \nThrough our public, private partnership with the Clark County Department of \nFamily Services, the CACF serves as the nonprofit and advocacy arm for the \nSouthern  Nevada  Children’s  Advocacy  Center  (SNCAC).  The  CACF  works \ndirectly  with  key  county  personnel  and  SNCAC  team  members  to  provide \nservices to and improve outcomes for child abuse victims and their families. \n \nI have witnessed first-hand the hard work and dedication of Cheryl Cooley, her \nteam and agency partners in serving the needs of at-risk children and their \nfamilies in southern Nevada. I have met and spoken to survivors, and have seen \nthe impact the SNCAC has made in their lives. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 28 \n \nI  was  once  told  the  SNCAC  was  southern  Nevada’s  best  kept  secret.  My \nquestion at that time was to ask why. As the number of suspected child abuse \nand neglect cases in Nevada continue to rise, why keep child advocacy centers \nsecret. They should be acknowledged for the important work they do. \n \nAs you move forward with your deliberations, I urge the Committee to consider \nthe testimony we have heard today, and think of Lexi and the thousands of \nother children and families helped by CACs each year. Please help bring CACs \nout of the shadows and vote in favor of this bill. \n \nMS. BLOCK: \nThe Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers supports A.B. 228. We support \nmultidisciplinary  and  holistic  support  for  youth  to  emphasize  healing  from \ntrauma. We support legislation that aims to help children heal and move on from \ntrauma in a supportive and healing-centered environment. \n \nTESS OPFERMAN (Nevada Women’s Lobby): \nThe  Nevada  Women’s  Lobby  supports  A.B. 228.  Child  abuse  can  be \ncomplicated to address and navigating the process is not easy. It is difficult and \ntraumatic for children to share their story, especially if it requires rehashing their \nstory with one person after another. \n \nCOLE MCBRIDE (Washoe County Child Advocacy Center): \nThe Washoe County Child Advocacy Center supports A.B. 228. \n \nROSS  ARMSTRONG  (Administrator,  Division  of  Child  and  Family  Services, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nI was involved in setting up the CAC in Pahrump and can tell you the amazing \npower this model has in empowering young people who have been abused is \nincredible. \n \nThe Division is neutral on this bill. Part of this bill has the Division setting up an \naccount that can take and distribute donations to qualifying entities. We have \nno concerns about the operational part of the bill. We are happy to do our part \nin terms of supporting this model throughout the State. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 228 and open the hearing on A.B. 345. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 29 \n \nASSEMBLY  BILL  345  (1st  Reprint):  Revises  provisions  relating  to  drug \nparaphernalia. (BDR 40-978) \n \nASSEMBLYMAN DAVID ORENTLICHER (Assembly District No. 20): \nAssembly Bill 345 addresses the problem of opioid overdose deaths in Nevada, \nwhich has been a significant problem for a number of years. There has been a \nrecent increase from the problem of fentanyl-laced heroine and other drugs. \nUsers are buying heroine or methamphetamine and may or may not know that it \nis  laced  with  fentanyl  which  can  cause  an  overdose.  One  way  to  prevent \noverdose deaths is to distribute fentanyl testing strips so users can know what \nthey are buying. Fentanyl is considered illegal drug paraphernalia in Nevada. \n \nThis  bill  excludes  fentanyl  testing  strips  from  the  definition  of  drug \nparaphernalia. There is an information sheet (Exhibit L) on the legislative website \non Fentanyl Testing to Prevent Overdose showing how fentanyl testing strips \nwork. \n \nThere is a conceptual amendment (Exhibit M) to broaden the bill because it is \nfentanyl today; tomorrow, or next year, there may be another adulterant that \ncauses overdose deaths. This way, we do not have to come back for a new bill. \nThe conceptual amendment, Exhibit M, allows other testing products in case \nthere is a different adulterant within the next two years. \n \nThe  bill  now  states  testing  for  adulterants  are  for  use  in  cutting  controlled \nsubstances, and there may be other controlled substances that are adulterated \nthat we may want to also test. \n \nThe existing provision, section 1, subsection 2 has not been amended. That is \nprevious legislation to ensure needles and syringes can be distributed and are \nnot considered contraband. The bill is being interpreted in a restrictive way, so \nwe have been asked to consider expanding some of the items to tourniquets to \nensure people do not get into trouble. \n \nWe are working with law enforcement, and they are comfortable with what we \nhave done so far on the bill and the conceptual amendment, Exhibit M. I have \nnot had occasion to speak with them about further broadness. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 30 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe intent of the bill started with fentanyl testing strips but has been broadened \nin the conceptual amendment, Exhibit M, to test for anything. You will have \nsomething for us by the time we work session the bill that would broaden it \nbeyond narcotics to other controlled substances. Also, to add to the list of \nparaphernalia in subsection 2 that would not be considered criminal. \n \nASSEMBLYMAN ORENTLICHER:  \nIn section 2, subsection 2, paragraph (a) it says, “hypodermic syringe, needle, \ninstrument,  device  or  implement,”  which  should  capture  a  broad  range. \nApparently,  there  have  been  issues  with  this.  The  suggested  language  we \nreceived from people who work in the field would be to add “including sterile \ninjection equipment provided by syringe services programs including mixing or \ncooking devices and tourniquets.” \n \nNICHOLAS SHEPACK (American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada): \nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada supports A.B. 345 and believes \nwe can save lives by decriminalizing certain testing items and items used to \nadminister drugs. I went to high school during the peak of the opioid crisis. I \nburied too many of my friends who fell victim to addiction through prescription \ndrugs  and  heroine.  Once  fentanyl  arrived  on  the  scene,  things  got  uglier. \nFentanyl is found in what is perceived as prescription medication. Exempting \ntest strips from Category E felonies will save lives. \n \nThe war on drugs has criminalized everything from behavioral health issues to \nsimple testing equipment. It is beyond time we start addressing these issues as \nthey are, which are behavioral health issues, and stop criminalizing simple items \nsuch as a syringe or test strip. \n \nLISA RASMUSSEN (Nevada Attorneys for Criminal Justice): \nNevada Attorneys for Criminal Justice supports A.B. 345 as written and with \nthe  conceptual  amendment,  Exhibit  M.  Consistent  with  what  Mr.  Shepack \nstated, we believe this is a productive decriminalization of what is currently \ncategorized  as  paraphernalia  but  should  be  considered  life-saving  tools.  We \nwant people to stop using or possessing illicit drugs that were not prescribed to \nthem. Unfortunately, that is not the reality we live in. \n \nWhat we are seeing on the street today with regard to our clients and cases \ncoming forward, are a lot of high-potency drugs. Even though we would not \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 31 \n \nwant  to  encourage  illicit  drug  use,  having  the  test  strips  available  is \nappropriately  decriminalizing  the  use  of  them  in  a  manner  that  could  allow \npeople to be safe and not end up in an accidental overdose situation. \n \nLISA LEE: \nI support A.B. 345 and its proposed amendment, Exhibit M. As a person in \nlong-term recovery from opioid use disorder, a doctorate student in public health \nand a person who conducts harm reduction outreach and peer support in my \ncommunity, I am terrified the people in my life will all die. I am saddened by the \nfriends I have lost to overdose. In our community, there is fentanyl in pressed \npills,  methamphetamines  and  heroine.  Thanks  to  fentanyl  test  strips  and \nnaloxone, we are able to stay ahead of a steeper trend of fatal drug poisoning. \n \nWhile it is important to test for fentanyl, we know this is the adulterant du jour, \nand we need to keep in mind there will be emerging adulterants threatening \nmore lives. All sterile injection supplies distributed by syringe service programs \nshould be explicitly decriminalized. \n \nDR. WOODARD: \nIn 2020, we had 484 opioid-related overdose deaths, which was more than we \nhad previously when we considered the peak of the opioid crisis in 2011, and \n110 more opioid overdoses than in 2019. This resulted in a 40 percent increase \nStatewide and a 44 percent increase in Clark County. \n \nSynthetic opioid overdose statistics have increased six-fold since 2010, from \n39 to 246 in 2020. These deaths now account for over 50 percent of the \noverdoses in Nevada. Similar to naloxone, fentanyl test strips are an essential \noverdose prevention strategy that must be available within a community. \n \nThe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration announced on \nApril 7, 2021, that states are now able to use federal funds to purchase and \ndistribute fentanyl test strips. These test strips are an essential harm-reduction \nstrategy to reduce opioid-related overdose deaths. The surge in drug overdose \nstatistics nationally, and in Nevada, is driven in large part by fentanyl found in a \nbroad range of substances including methamphetamines. Many people are often \nunaware their drug supply contains fentanyl, resulting in fatal overdose. These \ntest strips allow individuals to test their drugs prior to use to determine if they \ncontain fentanyl. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 32 \n \nThere is a growing body of research that has demonstrated when individuals are \nable to test their drug supply for fentanyl, and fentanyl is identified as being \npresent,  they  change  the  way  they  are  using  those  drugs  to  be  safer  and \nreducing harm. Without explicit exemption of fentanyl test strips and other such \ntesting supplies as drug paraphernalia, distribution by the State and community \norganizations would be significantly hindered, and individuals in possession of \ntesting strips would be at risk for further charges. \n \nJESSICA JOHNSON (Southern Nevada Health District): \nThe Southern Nevada Health District is neutral on S.B. 345. By now, you are \nfamiliar with the opioid epidemic and its impact on drug overdose statistics, \nwhich are now the leading cause of death in the U.S. for people under the age \nof 50. Unfortunately, according to the Southern Nevada Health Districts 2020 \nmortality data, the new wave in the overdose epidemic is fueled by adulterated \nand  counterfeit  opioids,  primarily  fentanyl.  This  preliminary  data  suggests \nfentanyl is being used in counterfeit pills and impacting younger Nevadans when \ncompared to non-fentanyl fatalities. \n \nWhile fentanyl is currently the most recognizable adulterant in the drug supply, \nit is not the only one of concern. Numerous other adulterants exist for which \nthere is much less available data. In the past year alone, approximately 27 novel \npsychoactive substances were identified; that is more than two per month. \n \nResearch  has  demonstrated  that  comprehensive  drug  checking  is  an \nevidence-based strategy and should be part of a broader approach to address \nthe risks associated with the proliferation of fentanyl and emerging adulterants \nin our drug supply. Given this evolution, broadly including adulterant testing \nwould  allow  for  a  more  rapid  response  to  emerging  novel  psychoactive \nsubstances in our communities.   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 33 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 345.

CANNIZZARO (Senatorial District No. 6): \nI  will  read  from  my  written  presentation  on  S.B.  420  (Exhibit  B)  and  have \nsubmitted a conceptual amendment (Exhibit C). \n \nKATIE KEITH, J.D., M.P.H. (Associate Research Professor and Adjunct Professor \nof Law, Georgetown University): \nI  am  speaking  on  S.B.  420  regarding  additional  health  insurance  coverage \nexpansion in Nevada. I have submitted my written presentation (Exhibit D) and \nsupplemental documents (Exhibit E). \n \nSHENAKWA HAWKINS (Care With Purpose Medical Center, LLC): \nI am in favor of S.B. 420 and will explain why this bill is needed. I am a health \ncare  provider,  small  business  owner  and  advanced  practice  registered  nurse \n(APRN). I run the Care With Purpose Medical Center in Las Vegas. We serve \ncommunities of color and low-income communities including a large homeless \npopulation.  I  know  what  it  is  like  to  lose  your  job  along  with  your  health \ninsurance. I lost mine at the start of this pandemic when the clinic I worked for \nshut its doors. Our practice at Care With Purpose Medical Center treats many \npeople who are in the same situation I was in. I have been a nurse for over \n20 years, including in emergency rooms and trauma centers. If people had been \nable to afford health insurance and were treated proactively, they could have \navoided  expensive  emergency  care.  I  see  this  far  too  much,  and  it  is \nheartbreaking and frustrating. Anything we can do to make health insurance \naccessible and affordable will help many people and  S.B. 420 will do just that.  \n \nAs an APRN, the pay parity provision of the bill will allow me to keep my clinic \nopen. There is so much healthcare inequality in our existing system, and that is \npart of what inspired me to open the practice and help historically underserved \npopulations. We are providing the same level of care with preventive medicine \nand management of chronic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes and high \ncholesterol, which are dominant medical conditions in communities of color. \n \nCost of insurance is a major factor. This bill will help bring costs down and help \ncommunities like the ones I serve in my clinic. I ask this Committee to help us \nand pass S.B. 420. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nRANDI LAMPERT, M.D.: \nI  am  a  pediatrician  practicing  in  Las  Vegas,  and  I  support  a  Nevada  Public \nOption.  I  have  seen  too  many  people  go  without  health  care  or  medical \ntreatment. My written testimony has been submitted (Exhibit F). \n \nSENATOR CANNIZZARO: \nThis bill is personal to me. While I was in college, I injured myself badly after \nlosing my health insurance. Because I did not have access to health care, the \nmedical  bills  followed  me  after  law  school  as  I  was  seeking  to  become  an \nattorney, and it took years to pay the medical bills.  \n \nI cannot imagine what it must be like to wonder if your baby is okay, or the \nperson carrying your child is going to be okay. Doing nothing is not a solution. \nSenate Bill 420 will help get us there. I will now read from my written remarks, \nExhibit B, with a summary of the Public Option. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWill the Public Option be open to anyone living in Nevada? What waivers to the \nrules as part of the State Innovation Waiver in section 11 will you be requesting \nto obtain federal financial support for the Public Option? \n \nSENATOR CANNIZZARO: \nThe Public Option would not be available to individuals who are covered under \ntheir employer-paid health plans, especially large employers from multiemployer \nhealth plans. We are talking about the individual and small-group market, and \nthat is what this product is designed to capture. \n \nWe will work with the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to \nlook at what waivers are available. We have also looked at the Affordable Care \nAct  (ACA)  1332  waiver.  We  want  to  make  sure  there  is  enough  built-in \nflexibility and innovative capacity to get funds to help buy down the costs of \npremiums. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nSixty-five percent of individuals in our State are eligible for Medicaid or subsidy \neligible under the ACA. A substantial portion of the rest of that population are \nundocumented individuals and not eligible for subsidy under the Silver State \nHealth Insurance Exchange. Who are we targeting or bringing into this market? \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nAre we going to disrupt the  small-group market  so massively that it brings \npeople in? I am trying to understand who is going to sign up. \n \nSENATOR CANNIZZARO: \nThere are many individuals who are uninsured and do not qualify for subsidies, \nand affordability is a barrier with respect to the Exchange. \n \nSTACIE WEEKS (Aurrera Health Group): \nOut of 350,000 individuals in the small-group category, 37 percent are eligible \nfor Medicaid but have not yet enrolled. Affordability challenges today in the \nExchange are experienced by 17 percent. The Public Option would be available \nto those individuals, and if they are eligible for the Exchange, could purchase \nthe  product.  Immigration  status  is  a  barrier  for  27  percent  of  individuals; \nhowever, it is not always the undocumented individuals. It could be individuals \neligible for Medicaid who are barred by the five-year residency rule. If individuals \nhave not lived in the U.S. for five years, they cannot purchase Medicaid. Many \nimmigrants struggle with this barrier because they are low-income when they \nfirst  move  to  the  U.S.  This  product  would  be  available  to  that  27  percent \noutside the Exchange. This product would also be available to the 19 percent \nwho are eligible for Nevada Health Link but are not enrolled. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nFor the 17 percent who have affordability challenges, there was a significant \nexpansion of tax credit subsidy and support through the American Recovery \nPlan, including increases beyond 400 percent of the federal poverty level. Does \nthat address some of the 17 percent? \n \nMS. WEEKS: \nThat subsidy amount is temporary and would not be long-term to address the \nissue. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWill  this  work,  and  is  this  going  to  be  revenue  neutral  by  using  other \npractitioners such as doulas? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe will have general discussions about the cost and then a deeper conversation \nwith the Senate Committee on Finance. We have a fiscal note posted. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nSENATOR CANNIZZARO: \nThe  Public  Option  is  separate  from  Medicaid  eligibility.  The  overall  goal  of \nS.B. 420 is to help increase access to affordable care. We have been talking \nwith  DHHS  and  the  Exchange  with  respect  to  pregnant  women  in  those \npopulations  and  some  of  the  surrounding  prenatal  and  postpartum  care.  In \nS.B. 420, there is the inclusion of eligibility for some of these services, which \nwould not be revenue neutral. There is a fiscal note associated with it and there \nare  federal  funds  that  would  accompany  those  as  with  many  Medicaid  and \nfederal matching dollars. The waivers and Public Option Trust Fund is about \nhealth insurance as a whole. Some of the Medicaid pieces would cost the State \nmoney, which we will discuss with the Senate Committee on Finance. Overall, \nbringing in federal dollars will help with savings in terms of more acute care for \nthose patients. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nHow are we motivating insurance companies or hospitals to cut their costs \nwhen the reality to provide coverage will increase from 5 percent to 15 percent \nin 4 or 5 years? \n \nSENATOR CANNIZZARO: \nIndividuals looking at the Public Option are uninsured and uncompensated at this \npoint. When hospitals or providers see those individuals, they are providing that \ncare for the uninsured. Those built-in costs are distributed among other people \nwho are paying for health insurance. The Public Option is a premium-based plan. \nOur goal with this is to create something that is more affordable so people can \nactually afford it. People may be eligible to get health care, but if they cannot \nafford  it  that  eligibility  is  meaningless.  When  individuals  are  covered,  even \nthough it may be a lower-cost plan, that is something that is far more than what \nhospitals  and  providers  would  be  getting  for  individuals  who  are  on \nuncompensated care. The motivation is to get more people insured so you are \nnot  facing  the  prospect  of  them  coming  in  for  medical  services  and  being \ncompletely uninsured. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nThis is a great bill, and I am happy to see it here in Nevada. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAccess to insurance does not always equal access to care. It depends on how \nskinny that network might be and the provider list, and whether that provider \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nlist has waitlists, or depending on the number of available providers, or if we \nhave the specialists we need in the network. How does the bill approach the \nquestion  of  network  adequacy  making  sure  that  just  because  you  have \ninsurance also means you have care? \n \nSENATOR CANNIZZARO: \nIf someone is eligible for insurance and cannot afford it, that is akin to being \nineligible for insurance. Similarly, if someone is on a plan that either does not \nprovide the basic level services he or she needs or, the individual does not have \naccess  to  see  a  provider,  then  that  is  akin  to  having  no  care  at  all. \nSenate Bill 420 has a couple of things in it that address that issue. We are \nrequiring groups bidding on those contacts to also bid on the Public Option to \nmake a good-faith bid for that product. If you take Medicaid patients, you are \nalso accepting the Public Option. This is similar to workers’ compensation and \nthe Public Employees’ Benefit Plan. We are creating a network of providers \nStatewide  that  will  see  these  patients  and  will  accept  that  insurance  to \nhopefully address the adequacy of care issue. We are also talking about this \nbeing a Statewide product where you will see the continuity of care even if \npeople were to move, or if they were unqualified individuals or did not have \nemployer-based health care, that they could also have that flexibility to stay \nwith their providers and make sure they could continue having that access with \nthis particular product. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIf I understand the bill correctly, the insurance companies are required to bid on \nthe Public Option if they want to bid on Medicaid. Do providers who accept \nMedicare or Medicaid also have to accept the Public Option? \n \nSENATOR CANNIZZARO: \nThat is correct. It also includes workers’ compensation, in particular, the State \nworkers’ compensation and Public Employees’ Benefit Plan (PEBP). \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSo we have had some challenges with providers choosing to opt out of our \nMedicare  and  Medicaid  systems  because  of  the  rates.  Do  we  have  any \nexperience with similar models in other states? Are we concerned about the \npotentially unintended consequence of losing providers who choose to get out \nof the whole public space? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nSENATOR CANNIZZARO: \nThis bill will ensure there are providers who will accept the Public Option so \npeople can get access to services. The populations sought to be served with the \nPublic Option are individuals who are not insured because they do not qualify, or \nthey are not insured because they are having affordability issues, either through \ntheir small-group employers that are not providing insurance or because these \nindividuals simply cannot afford what is offered. \n \nWe are not increasing eligibility for Medicaid rates and demanding those eligible \nare covered at the Medicaid rate. Individuals will choose an insurance plan and \npay the premiums based on the rate. Our goal is to provide a Public Option with \nnegotiated  rates  that  would  incentivize  providers  to  accept  clients  that  are \nunderinsured and provide them with coverage paid for through the system.  \n \nWe have not seen other states that have implemented this type of model. One \nof the important key aspects about this bill is there is built-in time to allow \nDHHS to help implement the Public Option. There is also time to consult with \nthe Exchange and insurance commissioner to ensure we are getting those price \npoints  correct  and  making  the  right  decisions  on  how  this  would  be \nimplemented. Additionally, we are going to take time to look at the data and \nmake sure what we are doing does not inadvertently price out other providers or \nresult in a loss of providers. The goal is to ensure there are individuals who \nwould be accepting the Public Option and create a network of providers. \n \nMS. WEEKS: \nMinnesota has a similar provision for its Medicaid program, public employee \nprogram and workers’ compensation. It is called Rule 101 in Minnesota, and it \nworks well there. There are robust networks of providers in Minnesota because \nof that rule. Since you are tying it to Medicaid in many ways and doing a \nprocurement together, you are going to be incentivizing plans if providers want \nto offer the product and obtain the money Medicaid can bring as well as this \nmarket. We know the contracts to managed care are close to $2 billion. If \ninsurance  companies  want  that,  it  would  incentivize  them  to  do  better  by \nproviders to make sure they are in their networks to offer and incentivize those \nplans to come forward, and work with providers in a way that maybe they are \nnot today. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nPlease walk me through the timeline. I want to make sure it is clear on the \npublic record that this is not effective July 1, for people would think they have \naccess to insurance in the next year. \n \nSENATOR CANNIZZARO: \nIn  the  proposed  conceptual  amendment,  Exhibit  C,  on  page  2,  item  9,  we \nrevised it to be available for the coverage year beginning January 1, 2026 to \nallow  for  alignment  of  procurement.  This  is  not  something  that  would  be \nimplemented July 1. Our goal is to build in that lead time so there is enough \nspace for DHHS in consultation to provide for that procurement—also, time for \nus to get the data in the interim through actuarial studies to ensure we are \nputting it in a good spot. By building in that time and allowing this to become a \nplan year effective in 2026, it allows the flexibility that is needed. It is also \nencouraging creativity on our part, as a State, to come up with a way in which \nto implement this, resulting in savings to Nevadans. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe bill recognizes this could be a problem due to the fact we are going to allow \nPEBP and Medicaid to opt out of that requirement. We are saying in section 13, \nsubsection 2 of the bill, that if we are going to disrupt access for our people \nthrough Medicaid and PEBP, or if they are going to have difficult access to \ncovered services, we are going to allow them to waive this requirement for \ncommensurate access. \n \nIn section 10, is it stating there have to be at least two plans, a gold and a \nsilver option offered? \n \nSENATOR CANNIZZARO: \nYes, there would be a gold plan and silver plan. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nHow  should  section  10,  subsection  5,  as  amended  in  your  conceptual \namendment, Exhibit C, regarding costs, be interpreted? Is it that over four years \nthe costs of these plans will be 15 percent less or the average costs of all \nhealth insurance plans will be 15 percent less? \n \nSENATOR CANNIZZARO: \nThis is applicable to the Public Option only, not to plans across the State. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe targeted price reduction of health insurance is not a downward pressure on \nall plans in the State to try to reduce premiums. It is specific solely to these \ntwo Public Options. Is this correct? \n \nSENATOR CANNIZZARO: \nYes. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIn the amendment, Exhibit C, bullet point 6 as it relates to the Culinary Workers \nUnion Health Fund, is the idea it would be subsidy eligible if it is offered on the \nExchange. Would it be able to enroll people who are not members of the group? \nIf an association health plan would fit this category, could it enroll people who \nare not part of the association? \n \nSENATOR CANNIZZARO: \nThis is not specific to any particular group. We have many multiemployer plans \nin our State. Individuals may find themselves in a situation where they have lost \ntheir healthcare coverage because of loss of employment for a period of time. \nThe goal is, with approval from the federal government for different waivers and \nsubsidies the individuals might apply for, this is going to allow a structure in \ncollaboration with DHHS to make sure these groups could continue coverage for \nthe individuals who would otherwise have fallen off the group plans. The goal is \nto create continuity of care and ensure people can keep their health insurance \neven though they may have periods where they would not otherwise remain. \nPart of this is allowing flexibility and working with DHHS to create options and \nhaving approval with respect to waivers through the federal government. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIt is not open to the general public; would it only be people as part of the \nqualified group? \n \nSENATOR CANNIZZARO: \nOur intention is to make sure individuals who would still be qualified under that \nqualified  group.  If  there  were  an  indication  it  would  be  feasible  to  include \nindividuals such as family members that potentially would have fallen off or \nwould not be covered, they could potentially be covered. It is not as prescriptive \nas that in the language and how we are envisioning it. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe  have  the  intent  of  the  bill  on  the  record  but  would  like  our  Counsel, \nEric Robbins, to address the 15 percent for clarification. \n \nERIC ROBBINS (Counsel): \nThe  bill  provides  the  Director  of  DHHS  may  revise  the  performance  targets \nprovided the Public Option remains on target to reduce average premiums for \nhealth  insurance  in  the  State  by  at  least  15  percent  over  4  years  in  the \nconceptual amendment, Exhibit C, in which the Public Option is in operation. \nThe text of the bill would go along with Senator Kieckhefer's initial impression \nthat it would have to create downward pressure on all of the health insurance in \nthe State and lower the average premiums of all health insurance by at least \n15 percent. If it is going to carry out the intent expressed on the record today, \nthe bill would need to be amended to reflect that intent. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nJust because we say a health insurance plan needs to have premiums that are \n15 percent less, that does not reduce costs by 15 percent. It may actually \nincrease costs and utilization, and there are a lot of different factors that could \nhappen downstream. Who is going to pick up that cost? \n \nSENATOR CANNIZZARO: \nWe are talking about getting individuals who cannot afford or are ineligible for \nhealth insurance. There are costs for uninsured, uncompensated care. It is more \nexpensive  to  cover  individuals  through  emergency  services  for  more  acute \nconditions, more often than not, or where a condition has gone untreated for a \nsignificant period of time. The treatment and mitigation of whatever the disease \nare  far  more  expensive,  intrusive  and  difficult  to  deal  with  and  are  not \ncompensated. We are not talking about instances where individuals have health \ninsurance and emergency services are what they are utilizing. We are talking \nabout individuals who have much higher costs getting them insured so they \nhave access to regular health care which, overall, will reduce their utilization of \nthose emergency acute services. Also, there is compensation where there was \nnone. Yes, there are costs associated with that, and we are trying to make it \nmore affordable, but the other alternative is these individuals go without health \ninsurance. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nPhilosophically, I do not know if that is where we are going to be getting people \nfrom. If we are opening up the small-group market, I am concerned it is going to \npoach more people out of that than some of the categories we are talking \nabout, like the 37 percent who are Medicaid eligible and go into a hospital with \na significant problem. Those hospitals do everything they can to make sure the \nindividuals are eligible or enrolled. If we make a plan 5 percent more affordable \nthan the second lowest silver plan, but people have made the choice not to \nenroll even though they are eligible on the Exchange now, I am not convinced \nthat will trigger them to sign up. I am concerned about where the cost shifts are \ngoing to happen to make up for some of this artificial pressure, and I think it is \ninto large-group insurance, employer-based insurance and downward pressure \non providers. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIn my experience when the ACA became effective, for instance, seeing patients \nwho saved up all their illnesses and instead of one or two problems, we were \ndealing with five different diseases all at once. This same kind of thing is going \nto happen, so there would be an initial, quite expensive problem you would be \nfacing. At the same time, that is the individual practitioner as opposed to the \nhospitals. In speaking with hospitals over the years, they do not make money on \nMedicaid or Medicare; they make up the difference on private insurance. What \nis it going to amount to for the practitioners in hospitals, hospitals themselves \nor  the  insurance  companies  that  have  done  many  things  to  invest  in  the \ncommunity? That is one of the challenges we are going to see, the investment \nin the community while they are trying to push down to that 5 percent and \neventually 15 percent. \n \nANNETTE MAGNUS-MARQUART (Battle Born Progress): \nWe support S.B. 420. My written remarks have been submitted (Exhibit G). \n \nDAVID GOLDWATER: \nI support S.B. 420. I am representing myself and the small business for whom I \nwork.  I  have  worked  around  health  policy  for  almost  30  years.  I  have  a \ndisclaimer in that access to affordable health care is the right of all Nevadans. \nI am a partner in a small retail business that employs 35 people and also have a \nsmall consulting firm that employs 3 people. We pay for health insurance for our \nemployees. If the Legislative building were open to the public, the line for small \nbusiness owners would be out the door in support of this bill because health \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \ninsurance costs are such a big part of our budgets. Probably 10 to 15 percent of \nour health insurance cost represents 20 to 30 percent of total compensation to \nour employees.  \n \nWe have an employer-based insurance program, and that is how we deliver \nhealth insurance, through our employer. That was not my choice nor anyone \nelse's, but that is the one we have. Providers should be paid for their services. \nThose costs should be fair and not shifted between the insured and uninsured. \nThe  incentives  for  care  should  be  aligned.  The  employer-based  system, \nhowever, is particularly hard on small businesses. That is where the gaps are \nand where this bill fills those gaps. Small businesses do not have easy access to \ncapital markets and therefore are generally undercapitalized. Additionally, most \nsmall businesses are the  primary source of income.  The  dollars we pay for \nhealth insurance for our employees is felt by the owners. Those monies would \notherwise go to our families and provide for our own well-being.  \n \nPRISCILLA  MALONEY  (American  Federation  of  State,  County  and  Municipal \nEmployees, Retirees Nevada Chapter 4041): \nWe support S.B. 420. My written remarks have been submitted (Exhibit H). \n \nSARAH ADLER (Nevada Advanced Practice Nurses Association):  \nWe  support  S.B.  420.  My  written  remarks  (Exhibit  I)  and  our  proposed \namendment to S.B. 420, section 30 (Exhibit J) have been submitted. \n \nERIC JENG (One APIA Nevada; Asian Community Development Council): \nWe support S.B. 420. My written remarks have been submitted (Exhibit K) as \nwell as a letter of support signed by many Asian Pacific Islander American small \nbusiness owners (Exhibit L). \n \nCHRISTINE SAUNDERS (Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada): \nWe support S.B. 420. My written remarks have been submitted (Exhibit M). \n \nQUENTIN SAVWOIR (Make It Work Nevada): \nWe support S.B. 420. My written remarks have been submitted (Exhibit N). \n \nBARRY GOLD (AARP): \nWe support S.B. 420. My written remarks from AARP (Exhibit O) have been \nsubmitted. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nKATIE ROBBINS (Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada): \nWe support S.B. 420. Nevada has one of the highest uninsured populations in \nthe Nation, and the Public Option will provide higher quality, lower cost care to \npeople across the State. The Public Option will also help address the disparities \npeople of color face when trying to find affordable quality care for themselves \nand their families. Increasing access to health care, including reproductive health \ncare, will make our State stronger and more equitable. \n \nJIM SULLIVAN (Culinary Workers Union Local 226): \nWe  support  S.B.  420.  We  support  the  bill  and  conceptual  amendment, \nExhibit C, because health care is a human right. This is a good first step toward \nmaking sure all Nevadans get quality and affordable health care. Nevada has \none of the highest uninsured rates in the Country, which this bill addresses by \ncreating a Public Option for working families who are either not eligible for \nhealthcare plans or cannot afford it. In addition, the conceptual amendment, \nExhibit C, to this bill would allow the Culinary Workers Union Health Fund to \nparticipate in the program and continue to take care of participants if they were \nto  lose  healthcare  benefits.  This  is  important  because  it  would  allow  union \nmembers and their dependents to continue to see their same doctors, not create \na gap in much needed treatments, and have access to the same prescriptions \nand specialists instead of having to start over with a brand-new insurer if they \nwere to lose coverage. \n \nEVAN LOUIE: \nI support S.B. 420. It makes sense to have insurance providers compete with \nthe  Public  Option  which  will  in  turn  provide  lower  premiums  and  expanded \ncoverage. Nevada is forty-eighth in the Nation for overall health care and has \nthe highest uninsured rate of the Medicaid expansion states. \n \nAs a personal story, my late wife was diagnosed with brain cancer four months \nafter  we  were  married  and  seven  and  one-half  months  pregnant  with  our \ndaughter. I stopped running my business and lived in the hospital taking care of \nmy wife and prematurely-born daughter. We could barely survive keeping up \nwith COBRA premiums and healthcare costs because of severe income loss and \ncost of living. After my wife's passing, affordable health care is something for \nwhich I have become extremely passionate. As a small business owner, I know \nthat  competition  drives  innovation,  but  having  more  options  is  better  for \neveryone. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nDANIEL CORONA (Mayor, West Wendover): \nWe support S.B. 420. In the summer of 2017, it was announced Nevada's \n14 most rural counties would have no insurance options due to the Exchange. \nThousands of Nevadans, including myself, would not receive health insurance \non the Exchange and simply be out of luck. Thankfully, at the last minute, State \nleaders  were  able  to  avert  a  disaster  and  secure  health  insurance  for  rural \nNevadans. The threat of no available health insurance through the Exchange still \nlooms yearly for rural Nevadans. However, there is potential for a long-term \nsolution  through  S.B.  420.  If  passed,  it  would  be  one  of  the  most \ncomprehensive and robust public health insurance plans in the Country. For the \nfirst time ever, Nevadans in rural areas of our State would be guaranteed access \nto affordable coverage through a Statewide Public Option.  This means rural \nproviders  and  hospitals  will  also  be  guaranteed  reimbursement  for  patients \nenrolled in the Public Option. This would be a game changer. \n \nRural  hospitals  provided  nearly  $30  million  in  uncompensated  care  in \n2020 alone. Meeting those costs has been crushing Nevada's rural hospitals \nand is a major factor in why so many have recently closed their doors. This bill \nwould also provide rural Nevadans with a Statewide network of doctors. They \ncould receive in-network care even if those providers are outside the patient's \nhome county. The Nevada Public Option will be offered to individuals, families \nand small businesses, providing health insurance through the Exchange. As the \nMayor of West Wendover, a rural community that struggles yearly with access \nto affordable health care, I stand in strong support of S.B. 420. \n \nPHILIP MALINAS, M.D.: \nI support S.B. 420. I am a psychiatrist in Reno. As a medical professional, I \nsupport  this  bill  and  urge  the  policymakers  to  expand  healthcare  access  by \npassing the Public Option. I have submitted my written remarks (Exhibit P). \n \nTHERESA BOHANNAN: \nI  support  S.B.  420.  I  am  a  mother  of  two  with  a  child  who  has  a  severe \ncongenital heart defect. I have long been an advocate for a Public Option and to \nfix  the  problems  the  ACA  was  unable  to  address  initially.  Not  having  a \nPublic Option was one of the main barriers to accessing affordable health care \nfor everyone nationwide. As many of the previous speakers stated, the high \nnumber of uninsured people in our State would be helped by lowering costs. \nWhile addressing this bill, we also need to look at maximum out-of-pocket rates \nand  deductibles;  the  cost-sharing  for  patients  has  been  increasingly \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nunattainable. I am coordinating care for my son in Las Vegas and wondering \nhow I am going to pay for airfare and hotel expenses. There are additional costs \noutside of the costs for health care which people are struggling to maintain. \nDuring the pandemic and when it was unsure how safe schools were, I looked \nat the option of leaving my job and looked at the Exchange. The out-of-pocket \nrates were incredibly high, about $13,000. As a parent of a child with special \nneeds,  I  have  met  those  maximum  out-of-pocket  costs  with  my  son's  care \ntotaling over $2 million, and he is 5 years old. I know quite well the struggles \nthat patients go through every day. \n \nENDER AUSTIN III (Faith in Action Nevada): \nWe support S.B. 420. I am speaking on behalf of many of our leaders across the \nState who have expressed reasons why they support this bill. This legislation \nallows for increased access, mobility and fostering equity in health care. Access \nto health care is a moral imperative. Access to health care allowed a mother \nwho was dying to live a dignified life in her final days of life. It was important \nthis mother maintain a state of normalcy even as her illnesses was progressing. \nPreacher David Ross spoke to me about the importance of health care when he \nfaced  a  heart  procedure  that  cost  $250,000.  If  he  did  not  have  health \ninsurance, he would have absolutely been put in debt that he would not have \nbeen  able  to  take  care  of.  Pastor  Jo  Harris  spoke  vigorously  about  the \nimportance of health care for Black men who face unique health disparities \nexacerbated by a lack of access to health care. In 2021, if America catches a \ncold, Black America has the flu. Another leader spoke about the importance of \nher patients being able to keep their health insurance while they transition from \njob to job. Senate Bill 420 allows folks to carry their health insurance from one \njob to another, alleviating some of the challenges we have with racial disparities \nand  ensuring  there  is  a  better  quality  of  life  for  many  others,  as  well  as \nproviding financial security. \n \nTOM CLARK (Nevada Association of Health Plans): \nWe oppose S.B. 420, primarily the sections dealing with the Public Option. \nI represent the private insurance companies that operate in Nevada. The most \nimportant  concern  we  have  is  cost—cost  on  implementation,  creating  and \nmanaging this new Public Option. The second biggest issue we have is access \nto care. When there are challenging things that occur within health care, we \ntend to find solutions. The healthcare system in Nevada is a system. When you \nlook at insurance, it is broken down in a number of different ways. There are \nlarge-group, small-group and individual markets, self-funded plans, Medicare and \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nMedicaid. About 11 percent of the Medicaid folks are the uninsured. The reason \nI bring up those other kinds of insurance is because the system operates as a \nsystem. With the Public Option concept, if you set the rate and compress a \nportion of the market, the remaining areas in the system expand to cover and \nsubsidize  the  costs  of  the  compression.  We  contemplate  that  under  this \nlegislation, there will be a cost shift where you may see a set price under the \nPublic Option, but those folks who are in those other elements of insurance will \nsee an increase in the cost of their insurance. \n \nThere are 100,000 Medicaid eligible people who could enroll. There are about \n80,000 people who qualify for zero-cost insurance through the Exchange. We \nneed to work to get those people into that system.  \n \nThis bill does not contemplate the increasing price of pharmaceutical drugs. We \nhave done work as insurers for years to increase the number of providers we \nhave, rural and urban and across-the-board disciplines, to bring them in. We fear \nthe impact S.B. 420 will have on network adequacy will be detrimental. Under \nthis  proposal,  the  healthcare  delivery  system  access  will  be  impacted. \nExperience  tells  us  a  Public  Option  of  this  nature  will  be  expensive,  and \nhealthcare costs for all Nevadans will increase while access will decline.  \n \nJAMES WADHAMS (Nevada Hospital Association): \nWe oppose S.B. 420. We support the notion of a Public Option; however, we \nhave issues with this bill. The one element missing in the bill is a prerequisite for \nan actuarial study. This population needs to be analyzed and studied so the \nmorbidity and healthcare characteristics can be understood. That should not be \ndifficult if a portion of this population is already Medicaid eligible and is available \nto simply getting them enrolled. That will cut this approximately by a third to a \nhalf, depending upon how it is calculated. There needs to be an actuarial study \nso that both the insurers know what they are insuring, and the providers know \nwhat they are delivering service to.  \n \nOne of the issues is that cost-sharing should not be an issue because it is \nalready part of the system. Medicaid reimbursements are substantially below \ncost,  and  unfortunately,  the  Medicare  reimbursements  are  also  below  cost. \nUsing a Medicare or Medicaid system as a basis mandates the cost system will \nbe less than the cost to prepare and deliver those healthcare services. That \ncreates a problem; when costs exceed the revenues, then adjustments will have \nto  be  made.  It  is  either  passed  on  to  the  commercial  market,  that  is,  the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nemployers that are not eligible to participate will have to begin picking up that \ncost, or it can impact into the workforce and jobs, which is the largest cost \nfactor in facilities and will have to be addressed. We tend to think it will erode \nthe  small  group  and  individual  plans,  particularly  those  that  are  being  put \ntogether by the Chambers of Commerce that have been so successful. \n \nThe ultimate problem as we find insurance for more people is that we have to \nbe careful we do not decrease the access. The concern is that by mandating \ncertain providers to participate, we may lose those certain providers from those \nother elements of care, for example, delivering care to the Public Employees \nBenefit Plan, injured workers and State Medicaid. For us in the hospital world, \nnurses  and  doctors  are  the  lifeblood  that  flows  in  these  facilities,  and  the \nadequacy of our workforce is critical to the delivery of care which was stressed \nso much in the last 15 months. Without those people willing to put themselves \non  the  frontline  and  the  facilities  adjusting  capacity,  it  would  have  been  a \nproblem. \n \nAs you review this bill, remember that costs come in different components. It is \nthe out-of-pocket costs to the consumer, cost of insurance and ultimately the \ncost to deliver healthcare service by the providers. We have to be sensitive to \nwhere all of those costs go. \n \nGiven the financial risks of setting up a public option at Medicare baseline rates \nfor physicians, the Nevada State Medical Association urges the Legislature to \nconsider  the  impact  and  policy  of  the  long-term  sustainability  of  physician \npractices  and  ultimately  the  access  to  care  for  Nevadans.  We  ask  the \nLegislature to refrain from using rates as the core of physicians’ payments under \nthis Public Option. Despite our concerns, there are some sections in the bill that \nwe support, which are reflected in my written submission (Exhibit Q). \n \nJARON HILDEBRAND (Nevada State Medical Association): \nWe  oppose  S.B.  420.  Our  membership  consists  of  the  majority  of  Nevada \nphysicians, but we consider ourselves first and foremost as a patient advocacy \norganization. We do share the priority of approving access and affordability of \nhealthcare  insurance.  Covering  the  uninsured  and  improving  healthcare \noutcomes and affordability have a long-standing priority for the Nevada State \nMedical Association. We are not opposed to the Public Option but today we are \nin opposition to S.B. 420 as written. We have concerns with payment parity \nwith respect to doulas, midwives and nurse practitioners. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nThe mandate in section 23 is another area of concern. We support physicians' \nfreedom of choice when it comes to healthcare plan participation and therefore, \nwe opposed the effort to require physicians' participation in the Public Option by \ntying  it  to  the  participation  of  other  State-based  programs.  This  mandatory \nparticipation provision overlooks the complexities of running a physician practice \nand in determining the capacity and ability of a practice to serve a patient mix. \nThere are many reasons as to why a practice may not participate with the plan. \nBurdensome administrative policies, saturation of practice resources, physician \ntime, engagement in alternative payment models, pending retirement and so on. \nIt is critical that the physicians are able to weigh in on the contract options and \nmake the decisions of what it is best for them, their practice, patients and staff.  \n \nThe next issue we have are the Medicare reimbursement rates in section 14 of \nthis bill that would establish provider payments using Medicare rates as a floor. \nWe fear these rates will become a defective rate for all Public Option contracts. \nMedicare  rates  have  not  covered  costs  of  providing  care  in  the  commercial \nmarket. According to data from the Medicare trustees and Medicare physicians, \npay has barely increased in nearly two decades. Written testimony (Exhibit R) \nand supporting documents (Exhibit S) have been submitted by the Nevada State \nMedical Association. \n \nMICHAEL HILLERBY (Renown Health; Hometown Health): \nWe oppose S.B. 420. While we support the concept of a Public Option focused \non providing coverage for the uninsured, we do oppose this bill. We would like \nto work with you and others to design a program that works for Nevada without \njeopardizing access to care or current options for coverage. We are acutely \naware of the importance of the payer mix as we strive to manage costs and \nmake the most efficient use of public and private dollars. When the number of \npatients  increase  in  Medicaid,  Medicare  and  other  programs  that  reimburse \nbelow cost, or for those who are uninsured, the cost burden shifts to providers \nand private health insurance patients. That impacts the number of providers \nwilling to enroll in these programs and see new patients. \n \nNevada ranks low in physicians, nurses and other primary care providers per \ncapita.  Nevada  has  among  the  lowest  Medicaid  reimbursement  rates  for \nhospitals in America. Our delivery system is fragile and sensitive to even small \nchanges in the payer mix. The same is true for the private insurance market for \nbusinesses and individuals. We cannot implement a new Public Option before \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nwe study and address the risk of losing providers in our system or making \nNevada a less attractive place to practice medicine. \n \nSenate  Bill  420  seeks  to  address  the  large  population  of  patients  who  are \neligible but not enrolled in Medicaid or subsidized Exchange plans. There is a \n37 percent  population  eligible  for  Medicaid  and  20  percent  or  more  for \nsubsidized coverage on the Exchange. We should focus on these areas before \nimplementing a new Public Option. We would like to work with you and the \nlarger healthcare community to continue the work done through S.C.R. No. 10 \nof the 80th Session, the Patient Protection Commission and the Committee to \nConduct an Interim Study Concerning the Costs of Prescription Drugs. If we are \nto build a Public Option that addresses the unique Nevada marketplace, work \nfirst needs to be done in the following areas: increase presumptive eligibility \noptions  to  better  capture  more  Medicaid  eligible  patients  and  help  them \ncomplete full enrollment; explore expanded Exchange enrollment opportunities, \nfor example, at point of care, and create something like Medicaid presumptive \neligibility for the Exchange. \n \nThe  actuarial  study  allowed  in  the  bill  must  be  mandatory  if  we  are  to \nunderstand the risk pool and the viability of any Public Option to avoid the \nresults seen in the state of Washington. This is also reflected in the early years \nof our own Exchange and lack of coverage in rural counties. Also, remove the \nsmall-employer eligibility provision must be removed. This will exacerbate the \ncost shifting problem and create more uncertainty in a small, fragile private \ninsurance market. \n \nWe must also address Medicaid rates, including the cuts made last summer. We \nneed  to  align  Medicare  reimbursement  with  value-based  care  and  patient \noutcomes,  helping  drive  better  access  to  the  best  care  in  the  appropriate \nsetting. This is a crucial step to deal with both access and the budget realities \nyou face every day. We share your commitment to helping more patients access \ncare with viable coverage and look forward to working with the Legislature to \naddress  the  needs  and  best  plan  for  the  future  in  a  way  that  encourages \nproviders and payers the same. \n \nSUSAN FISHER (Nevada State Society of Anesthesiologists): \nWe oppose S.B. 420. It was mentioned earlier that 35 percent of Nevadans \neligible for Medicaid are not enrolled, and we need to figure out why. People are \nnot  signing  up  for  Medicaid  because  physicians  who  can  choose  are  not \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \naccepting additional Medicaid patients. Unfortunately, we have physicians who \ncannot choose so they accept Medicaid patients and are losing money in their \npractices.  I  have  submitted  a  letter  from  the  Nevada  Society  of \nAnesthesiologists (Exhibit T) with details on our opposition to S.B. 420. \n \nANN SILVER (Reno + Sparks Chamber of Commerce): \nWe oppose S.B. 420. This bill would increase costs to our chamber businesses \nand their employees, reduce competition and choice for working Nevada families \nand possibly deter physicians from establishing much-needed practices in our \nState. We do support decreasing insurance costs and increasing availability. We \nare proud of the Reno + Sparks Chamber Association's health plan. We are able \nto  offer  affordable  comprehensive  vision,  dental,  medical  and  life  insurance \nplans to any small business with between two and fifty employees. This plan \ncovers thousands of lives across the State. \n \nSenate Bill 420 would not reduce the high cost of health care in Nevada. It \nwould, however, demand insurance premium reductions for a finite number of \nNevadans and increase the cost to a larger proportion of the population. Your \nhelp is needed in creating incentives to medical residencies, encouraging and \nfunding  healthcare  credentialing  and  refraining  from  establishing  arbitrary \ngovernment-set reimbursement rates. Your priorities should include encouraging \ndoctors to work in our State and rewarding students who choose careers in \nhealth care. We ask that you rethink this bill and instead establish a task force \nto explore healthcare affordability and existing products in the Nevada market. \nWe  have  enough  choices  without  adding  a  distraction  that  will  ultimately \ndiminish the healthcare industry, leaving it without a chance to compete and \nsucceed. \n \nSCOTT MUELRATH (Henderson Chamber of Commerce): \nWe oppose S.B. 420. We have submitted our opposition testimony (Exhibit U). \n \nCONNOR CAIN (Hospital Corporation of America; Sunrise Hospital and Medical \nCenter;  Mountain  View  Hospital;  Southern  Hills  Hospital  and  Medical \nCenter): \nWe  oppose  S.B.  420.  In  the  last  year,  our  hospitals  have  cared  for  nearly \n10,000 Covid-19-positive patients and ensured that Nevadans, including those \nin vulnerable zip codes, had  access to free, life-saving monoclonal antibody \ntreatments  all  while  sustaining  difficult  Medicaid  cuts  brought  on  by  the \npandemic's  crushing  impact  to  our  State  budget.  We  worry  that  the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nPublic Option  proposal  will  not  work  for  Nevada's  unique  healthcare \nenvironment  and  will  have  negative  consequences  for  both  patients  and \nproviders. At Sunrise Hospital, which is the largest provider of Medicaid services \nin our State, 15  percent of our patients are covered through commercial and \nmanaged-care insurance. Any shift in patients from commercial plans to a Public \nOption will reimburse at a far lower rate, threaten the ability of hospitals like \nSunrise to offer services and lose vulnerable members of our community who \nrely upon us so heavily. \n \nThere are other ways to expand health insurance coverage in Nevada. First, \nover 50 percent of uninsured Nevadans are eligible for Medicaid or subsidies on \nthe  Exchange  but  not  enrolled.  We  should  increase  efforts  to  ensure  these \npeople are enrolled. Second, Nevada has the highest share of those ineligible for \ncoverage  due  to  immigration  status.  If  we  truly  want  to  expand  insurance \ncoverage, we as a State should ensure all those who would otherwise lack \ncoverage are eligible for Medicaid. President Joe Biden is proposing a permanent \nextension of expanded pre-age subsidies available for private insurance in the \npublic  marketplace.  The  idea  is  to  build  in  the  ACA.  We  encourage  you  to \nsupport President Biden's approach to make health care more affordable. We \nhope this body will consider expanding coverage through enhanced enrollment \nefforts and coverage to otherwise ineligible Nevadans. \n \nMARY BETH SEWALD (Vegas Chamber): \nWe oppose S.B. 420. We share the goal that every Nevadan should have access \nto affordable health coverage. This bill will not reduce healthcare costs, rather it \nwill shift costs to other Nevadans. Mandating a State insurance plan to offer a \nrate 5 percent lower than commercial rates is another cost shift. Evidence from \nother  states  that  have  implemented  similar  programs  confirm  that  insurance \ncosts  went  up.  An  actuarial  study  should  be  conducted  before  this  bill  is \npassed. There are also concerns about requiring healthcare providers to accept \ngovernment-set  reimbursement  rates.  It  will  reduce  providers  to  accept \nMedicaid, push doctors out and make it more difficult to find physicians. Let us \nexpand  on  insurance  coverage  we  already  have,  enroll  more  people  into \nMedicaid, the State Exchange and Association healthcare plans. There are at \nleast 30 percent of uninsured Nevadans who are Medicaid eligible. Enrolling \nthem in Medicaid now would automatically reduce the uninsured population by \nmore than 100,000 lives. Raising reimbursement rates and addressing shortages \nof healthcare providers are also solutions that will help cover more Nevadans. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nPETER GUZMAN (Latin Chamber of Commerce): \nWe oppose S.B. 420. This bill is risky, overreaching and reckless legislation that \nwill  result  in  an  increased  cost  of  care  to  Nevadans  who  enrolled  within \nemployer-provided healthcare plans. This bill could reduce competition in the \nmarketplace as well as consumer choice. Unfortunately, this is done with well \nintention,  but  there  are  unintended  consequences  for  which  people  will  pay \ndearly. \n \nMARCOS LOPEZ (Americans for Prosperity Nevada): \nWe oppose S.B. 420. Our written testimony has been submitted (Exhibit V). \n \nCYRUS HOJJATY: \nI am in neutral on S.B. 420. I am confident this bill will reduce costs and bring \ncompetition to insurance plans. I would like more evidence on where similar \nideas have been tried. I am concerned about immigration status and that an \nunequal situation could be created by noncitizens taking more than they actually \npaid back. The ACA has not lowered premiums; it has raised premiums. I would \nlike to learn from other countries, particularly Europe, where they pay far less \nper capita for health insurance than we do here. \n \nIt is not just health insurance that concerns me. I want to make sure this bill \nunderstands why people are getting so sick. We have alarmingly high obesity \nrates. We need to understand what is causing these types of illnesses. \n \nNANCY BOWEN (Nevada Primary Care Association): \nWe are neutral on S.B. 420. We support affordable quality health care for all \nNevadans, and a Public Option could be an important tool to expand access to \nunderserved communities. We appreciate that S.B. 420 establishes payment for \nour health centers on par with what they receive from Medicare or Medicaid. \nWe support the expansion of Medicaid coverage to pregnant women above the \ncurrent income eligibility level, and for doulas and community health workers to \nextend the ability of our health centers to provide care outside the clinic. We \nhave long advocated for the expansion of managed care so our rural patients \ncan access specialists in rural population centers. \n \nWe have concerns about the effects of S.B. 420 on the future of managed care \nin the State and on the viability of our hospitals and other referral partners. We \nhave heard the concerns from these essential community partners, and we are \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \nwithholding our support until we understand more about the likely impact of this \nbill on them. \n \nAMBER FEDERIZO, APRN, FNP-BC (Hemostasis and Thrombosis Center of Nevada): \nWe are neutral on S.B. 420. Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) in Nevada \nthat cover Medicare recipients are not required to credential providers even if \nthe provider is willing or if the provider is the only federally-recognized center of \nexcellence for the treatment of bleeding disorders and clotting disorders in this \nState. For example, Smart Choice, Medicaid and Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act plans, such as the Culinary plan, continue to deny access to their \nmembers to the State's only federally-recognized hemophilia treatment center in \nNevada, and their  members  continue to pay cash to access care. We have \nprovided research to both of these payers that this specialized care delivered as \na Health Resources and Services Administration program reduces mortality and \nmorbidity  by  40  percent  at  a  cost  savings.  This  data  was  published  in  a \npeer-review journal and has not made a difference.  \n \nThis bill does not require MCOs providing care to Medicaid recipients or those \nwho  will  be  offering  a  Public  Option  a  contract  in  good  faith  with  all  the \nproviders  who  already  contract  for  fee-for-service  Medicaid.  We  have  been \nwilling to accept any contract made in good faith. We have been denied by \nsome  insurance  companies  stating  they  have  an  adequate  network  despite \nhaving no federally-recognized hemophilia treatment in their network. We look \nforward to the evolution of this bill to better address network adequacies. \n \nSENATOR CANNIZZARO: \nWe  have  looked  at  and  studied  the  Medicare  buy-in  since  before  the \n2017 Session, and there were issues with that. There was additional analysis \ndone in the last Legislative Session and proposed legislation which was not \nquite hitting the mark. We passed S.C.R. No. 10 of the 80th Session and did an \nactuarial analysis during the Interim that came out with data. We know who the \npeople  are  who  are  uninsured,  and  now  the  question  is  how  to  get  them \ninsured. That is exactly what we are trying to do.  \n \nThis bill, in contrast with bills in other states, provides for lead time for DHHS to \nput together a program that will work, and it provides the time to study the \npossibilities in the Interim and provides a procurement period that would take \ninto consideration all of those points that have been made. We are past the \npoint as to why we should not support S.B. 420 and we should continue to look \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \nat this or figure out who these people are or figure out how we should study \nthis more. We know who they are and I have talked to them at their doors. \nI would encourage you to knock on ten doors in your neighborhood and let me \nknow how many people talk to you about the cost of health care. I am willing to \nstate it is a fair number. \n \nCost shifts have come up a lot during testimony. When we are talking about the \nindividuals  who  are  qualifying  for  these  of  plans,  most  of  them  are \nuncompensated care right now. Those cost shifts are happening in the market \nright now. Yes, there will be cost shifts; we are dealing with health care. There \nare costs associated with multinational employer plans that are the best plans \nyou can have that are paying premiums or your employer is helping you pay \nthose premiums and providing that health care. You cannot say because there \nare costs associated with it we should do nothing to help these people who do \nnot have care or accessing it. When we talk about cost shifts, which is the \ncurrent  reality  of  our  system,  there  is  money  that  is  being  made  in  the \nhealthcare space. When we talk about cost shifts, what are we talking about? \nWe are talking about people who are not accessing that care because they do \nnot have health insurance. That is what S.B. 420 is getting at. \n \nIt is perplexing to me that the biggest argument is what we really should be \ndoing is expanding people on Medicaid. To say that if we expanded people on \nMedicaid and eligibility for Medicaid and providers and insurers were provided \nthose Medicaid rates, that this would be a better alternative to putting someone \non a health plan where they are paying premiums, and if this bill passes as is, \nthat floor is Medicare reimbursement. Adding people to Medicaid and saying \nthey would take more Medicaid patients and get reimbursed at a Medicaid rate \nis what we should do instead of implementing health insurance, and in the same \nbreath making the comment and argument about cost shifting, is perplexing \nbecause Medicaid rates are low. If we are talking about implementing something \nwhere  you  are  getting  reimbursed  higher  than  Medicaid  rates,  I  struggle  to \nunderstand why that is a reason to oppose this bill.  \n \nA comment was made that the government is setting the Medicare rates and \nthis is only Medicare compensation—this is not what S.B. 420 is. One of the \nconcerns we had through the Interim and discussions with stakeholders was \nthey would end up with Medicaid rates, so we tried to put a floor into the bill to \nprovide reassurance they would not be getting the Medicaid rates. What this \nintends to do, and with the ability of the State’s purchasing power and apply for \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \nwaivers and subsidies, the health insurers should be negotiating with providers \nfor those rates knowing that is the floor. This is going to incentivize them to \nprovide those value-based plans that are showing real health outcomes. This is \nnot the government setting rates. It is not a State-run program being subsidized \nby the taxpayers. This is allowing the State to get creative and innovative. We \ncannot study this anymore. That time has come and gone. We have the studies \nand the data. Even so, provisions in this bill allow for actuarial analysis and the \n1332 waiver will require that. If this gives people more assurance, I am happy \nto negotiate on the terms of the bill to ensure that does happen as this is our \nintent. \n \nWe  have  talked  about  the  percentages  of  the  premiums.  In  Colorado,  after \nnegotiations, there was an 18 percent reduction in premiums starting in 2022. \nWe are giving lead time. We are at 15 percent over 4 years after the plan is \nenacted.  That  is  worth  consideration.  With  respect  to  provider  participation \nrequirements, those have worked in Minnesota. We have data that does work, \nand this is the right thing to do and something that will provide that additional \npiece. If the idea that there were enough choices and we do not need any more \nchoices, then Nevada would not be seventh in the Nation for uninsured at a \npersistently high rate where we are the only State in that seven that did elect to \ndo Medicaid expansion. That has to tell you a lot about whether there is an \nissue here, whether there are sufficient choices and what we should be doing \nabout it. This does not affect employer-based health plans or association health \nplans. We are talking about how to provide affordable and accessible health \ncare to Nevadans when we know there is an issue and this is a step in the right \ndirection. We are still working with some people on amendments, and we will \ncontinue that work. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI  will  now  close  public  testimony  on  S.B.  420  and  open  the  hearing  on \nA.B. 205. \n \nASSEMBLY  BILL  205  (1st  Reprint):  Makes  various  changes  concerning  the \nacquisition,  possession,  provision  or  administration  of  auto-injectable \nepinephrine and opioid antagonists by schools. (BDR 40-98) \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 27 \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN LESLEY E. COHEN (Assembly District No. 29): \nI will present A.B. 205 and have submitted my written remarks (Exhibit W). \nTrey Delap from Group Six Partners will be presenting with me and has worked \nin behavioral health, addiction and recovery policy for years. \n \nTREY DELAP (Director, Group Six Partners LLC): \nI will provide background data for the Committee's consideration. The reason \nthis is relevant at the moment is because there has been a substantial increase \nin overdose deaths in 2020, especially for young people under 17 years of age. \nAll overdose deaths recorded in 2020 were unintentional opioid overdose deaths \nattributable to fentanyl. Overall, the State saw a 29 percent increase in the \ndeaths by overdose of opioids in the adult population. Synthetic opioids account \nfor two times the overdose deaths of heroin, and teen deaths are on the rise. \nThe number of young people who die by overdose of synthetic opioids equals \ndouble  the  peak  year  of  the  opioid  epidemic  in  2011.  The  sum  of  opioid \noverdose  deaths  in  2020  alone  in  the  8-  to  17-year-old  population  was \none-third of the total number of the same population in the previous decade and \na significant spike. Prevalence of opioids among young people is relatively high. \nYoung people have access and are using illicit drugs. Approximately 35 percent \nof young people in Grades 8, 10 and 12 have used illicit drugs during their \nlifetimes.  Of  those,  27  percent  have  used  drugs  in  the  preceding  year.  An \nexample is if youths reported they had used illicit drugs in the eighth grade, this \nmeans sometime between seventh and eighth grade they have used illicit drugs. \n \nThis gives us pause to look back at what the opioid epidemic has been and how \nit  has  evolved.  In  1995,  Oxycontin  hit  the  market  and  the  Fifth  Vital  Sign \ncampaign urged healthcare providers to take pain as seriously as other vital \nsigns. I was a junior in high school working in a hospital, and this was the \nchange that was going on there. Also in 1995, the State Board of Pharmacy \nactivated the Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP), one of the first in the \nCountry. Between 1995 and 2015, an opioid epidemic erupted and the Nevada \nLegislature enacted the Good Samaritan Drug Overdose Act in 2015. The first \nthing the Nevada Legislature did in response to the opioid epidemic was to \ncreate a harm reduction and safe harbor encouragement for people to intercede \nwhen opioid overdose was occurring. In 2017, a comprehensive overhaul of \nprescribing  occurred  and  the  PMP  became  mandatory.  Looking  at  opioids \nglobally, the U.S. is the largest consumer of morphine, counting for 40 percent \nof the world's consumption of morphine. This is an indication we have a future \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 28 \n \nthat will include opioids, and this is part of the connection we are looking at for \nschools. \n \nThe U.S. consumes 20 percent of the world's fentanyl. The public sentiment, \nabout 51 percent of the population, regard the opioid epidemic as a serious \nproblem. Sixty-seven percent of the public perceive there is lack of access or \nfunding for treatment or mitigating services with regard to the opioid epidemic. \nFifty-six percent of people agree that the opioid epidemic negatively impacted \nlocal economies and job growth. The number of overdose deaths from heroin \nbetween  1999  and  2019  dropped.  Approximately  20  percent  fewer  deaths \nwere from heroin, but those deaths were picked up by fentanyl overdoses which \nwas 29 percent.  \n \nWith regard to the specific impact on children, 2.2 million children are directly \naffected by parental opioid use or their own use. Approximately 2 million young \npeople were affected primarily by parental use. They were either living with a \nparent with opioid use disorder, had lost a parent to an opioid-related death, had \na parent in prison or jail because of opioids, or had been removed from their \nhome  due  to  an  opioid-related  issue.  An  additional  170,000  children  had \nopioid-use  disorder  themselves  or  had  accidentally  ingested  opioids.  Young \npeople have overdosed on opioids that were in the house. Of the 2.2 million \nchildren  directly  affected  by  the  opioid  epidemic,  41 percent  are  ages  5  or \nyounger, 32 percent are between the ages of 6 and 11, and 27 percent are \nbetween the ages of 12 and 17. \n \nThings have changed. In 2017, the PMP became mandatory. This was designed \nto target the first phase of the opioid epidemic which was overprescribing, and \nwe  have  seen  a  drop  in  opioid  prescriptions.  The  average  daily  morphine \nmilligram  equivalent  per  opioid  prescription  has  decreased  as  well.  The  raw \nnumber  of  prescriptions  have  gone  down,  and  the  quantity  and  amount  of \npotency have dropped. \n \nInnovations, such as the online JAVA House of Medicine newsletter response to \nthe opioid epidemic, is coprescribing naloxone and Narcan. The U.S. Department \nof  Veterans  Affairs  (VA)  has  been  doing  this  for  a  while.  The  VA  writes \nprescriptions for opioids, Narcan and naloxone and will educate others in the \nhousehold on its use. The top three prescribers by category writing prescriptions \nfor  naloxone  are  psychiatry,  addiction  medicine  and  pediatricians,  which \naccount  for  the  third  largest  group  of  prescribers  writing  for  naloxone.  The \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 29 \n \nAmerican  Academy  of  Pediatrics  (AAP)  has  identified  this  as  part  of  the \nmitigation  of  harm  and  awareness  of  the  impact  of  the  opioid  epidemic  on \nchildren. The AAP has been engaging, analyzing and monitoring the impact of \nchildren going into the foster care system. The AAP published a number of \narticles about families affected by parental substance abuse. This connects to \nthe availability of opioids in the house and children able to get access to them \nand also the strong market and demand.  \n \nThe profitability of synthetic fentanyl is tremendous. If a drug dealer has one \nkilogram of the source material, the dealer has two choices, make a kilogram of \nheroin or 20 kilograms of fentanyl. A kilogram of heroin will yield $80,000 in \nrevenue;  20 kilograms  of  synthetic  fentanyl  opioids  will  yield  $1.6 million  in \nrevenue. There is demand in the prevalence, use and awareness and certainly a \nprofit motive. \n \nNevada policy makers have seen this spike and are doing what they can with \npublic education. Following the last Session, the Nevada Institute for Children's \nResearch  and  Policy  prepared  a  policy  brief  specifically  addressing  the \navailability  of  naloxone  in  public  schools.  All  this  information  suggests  we \nshould  do  something.  The  opioid  epidemic  has  been  an  all-hands-on-deck \nresponse. This is an important piece of legislation. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN COHEN: \nThe Health Department has reported the age range of use of opioids is falling to \nsuch an extent that the average age has fallen from 49 years old to 29 years \nold. The federal government, in an effort to stop the health crisis, has been \ngiving  out  opioid  antagonists  to  prevent  overdose  without  qualification.  The \nNevada  Osteopathic  Medical  Association,  National  Association  of  School \nNurses, and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration of the \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services have confirmed that Narcan is \nsafe and can be given without harm. According to the Nevada Osteopathic \nMedical Association,  \n \nNaloxone (Narcan) is a safe and effective drug for the treatment of \nsuspected opioid overdoses … the drug is administered to a person \nwho  is  not  experiencing  a  narcotic  overdose  but  other  medical \nevent, it will not cause harm.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 30 \n \nSomeone overdosing from an opioid will die without intervention. Often lives are \nlost  waiting  for  the  ambulance  to  arrive.  The  naloxone  administered  while \nwaiting  for  the  ambulance  saves  lives.  It  is  safe  and  more  benign  than \nepinephrine and does not harm someone who is not overdosing.  \n \nAt different times, naloxone kits have been distributed to different people in the \nbuilding. These were purchased with money from the federal government. The \nNevada  State  Opioid  Response  reports  the  distribution  of  13,185  kits  and \nreversals from the use of naloxone for 932 Nevadans who would have died if \nthey  did  not  receive  naloxone.  The  kit  I  have  from  Partnership  Carson  City \ncontains gloves, information on opioids, instructions and a couple of naloxone \nsprays. You do not have to have training to use the kit, you simply read the \npamphlet  and  can  save  someone's  life.  Organizations  such  as  Partnership \nCarson City provide free monthly training for approximately 30 to 60 minutes. \nThe administration of naloxone itself takes about 10 minutes. The training also \nstresses calling for medical help.  \n \nThis bill is enabling language and no mandate. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI can see this bill is built on the work of former Nevada Senator Debbie Smith on \nthe epinephrine legislation with a high level of confidence that this can save \nlives. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN COHEN: \nThis bill was also built on the work of Assemblyman John Hambrick in the last \nSession. The bill was not quite there at the end of the Session. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will now close the hearing on A.B. 205 and open the hearing on A.B. 96. \n \nASSEMBLY  BILL  96  (1st  Reprint):  Revises  provisions  relating  to  emergency \nresponse employees. (BDR 40-96) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN LESLEY E. COHEN (ASSEMBLY DISTRICT NO. 29): \nI  am  presenting  A.B. 96  which  came  from  my  interest  in  peer  support  for \nfirst responders. I have submitted my prepared remarks (Exhibit X). \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 31 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe are seeing many bills this Session which have the language \"within the \nlimits of available money\" or \"as money is available.” Is there anything we are \ndoing out of the Nevada Office of Suicide Prevention or any of the behavioral \nhealth initiatives or anything along those lines which align with this bill? Are \nthere other efforts the Committee should know about in terms of making sure \nour emergency responders have the behavioral support they need? \n \nMARGOT  CHAPPEL  (Deputy  Administrator,  Regulatory  and  Planning  Services, \nDivision  of  Public  and  Behavioral  Health,  Department  of  Health  and \nHuman Services): \nWe are looking at the fees for license for our emergency medical services (EMS) \nfolks, and the advisory committee will be given an opportunity to fund and \nincrease those fees. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThere is a peer support line that is operating for EMS providers today? \n \nMS. CHAPPEL: \nYes.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe idea then is that the framework is built and there is someone already doing \nit, but if money could be found, we could expand on those efforts. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN COHEN: \nThere  is  a  program  in  northern  Nevada  working  on  a  program  for  southern \nNevada. This program is about getting information out there. There is also a \ndata collection piece to this bill to gather data about suicide attempts, and \nsuicide and first responders. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe data collection is also to the extent money is available. Hopefully, we can \nfind a path to do meaningful work. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN COHEN: \nI agree. There are also the pieces about getting the information out and having a \nplace  for  the  information  to  flow  through.  It  is  not  just  coming  from \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 32 \n \na not-for-profit, but the State is providing that information to people who might \nbe looking for it. \n \nANTHONY YARBROUGH (Veterans of Foreign Wars): \nWe  support  A.B.  96.  Many  first  responders  who  are  law  enforcement  and \nfirefighters come from the ranks of our military and veterans. For that reason, \nwe recognize one of the biggest challenges we face today is a high rate of \nsuicide among our members. There is a different world for an average civilian \nwho has to deal with trauma, death and carnage, and the difficulty of actively \nperforming their jobs on a daily basis. We recognize this could impact veterans, \nand we want to support that.  \n \nSuicide prevention is our No. 1 goal, and we recognize peer support is a proven \nfoundation  of  success.  It  helps  to  identify  the  causation  as  well  as  the \nprevention. This is a good start since we have not been able to stop suicide—all \nwe  can  do  is  try  to  prevent  it.  The  peer  support  volunteers  go  through  a \ncombination of training, exercise, counseling and peer advocacy. Please support \nthis bill. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThe VA has trained peer-to-peer specialists to support veterans. To the extent \nmoney is available, we may be able to collaborate with the VA, and if not at the \nfederal level, we should probably be able to do something with the Nevada \nDepartment of Veterans Services. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will now close the hearing on A.B. 96. The hearing on A.B. 217 is now open. \n \nASSEMBLY  BILL  217:  Requires  training  for  unlicensed  caregivers  at  certain \nfacilities. (BDR 40-454) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN LESLEY E. COHEN (Assembly District No. 29): \nI am presenting A.B. 217 which came out of the Interim 2019-2020 Legislative \nCommittee on Health Care. I have submitted my written remarks (Exhibit Y). \n \nMS. CHAPPEL: \nDuring the pandemic, we witnessed quite a few citations in facilities where \nunlicensed  caregivers  worked.  We  saw  people  working  in  the  kitchen  who \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 33 \n \nprepared  food  without  a  mask  and  other  violations  performed  by  untrained, \nunlicensed caregivers. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nMany of us were on the Interim Committee that asked for this bill to be moved \nforward. \n \nMR. GOLD: \nAARP Nevada  supports  A.B.  217.  Sometimes  the  State  is  good  for  these \nunlicensed personnel. These employees are fingerprinted, background checked \nand tuberculosis tested, but sometimes that is all that is required. I think it is \nimportant  when  people  bring  a  family  member,  or  they  themselves  go  to \nfacilities which have unlicensed staff with caretaking responsibilities, that the \nemployees know what they are doing. A lot of these facilities, such as homes \nfor individual residential care, have overnight staff, kitchen staff and caregivers. \nWe  are  not  sure  how  they  are  trained  and  tested.  The  licensed  staff  have \nestablished training regimens, which is great. This bill is the best way to ensure \nunlicensed personnel are trained and tested properly. We have to protect the \nmost vulnerable people who live in or get treatment at these facilities. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWhen this bill passes, or even before it passes, these facilities will take to heart \nwhat our intention is and not wait until January 1, 2022, to have regulations to \nforce them to implement training for their unlicensed personnel.  \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN COHEN: \nThis is a modicum of regulations for training of people who are dealing with our \nmost vulnerable population, whether it is infectious disease control or helping \nget someone on a bus without hurting the individual.   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 34 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will now close the hearing on A.B. 217.

(BDR 40-799) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN DANIELE MONROE-MORENO (Assembly District No. 1): \nI am here today to present A.B. 287, a measure providing for the licensing and \nregulation of freestanding birthing centers. \n \nAssembly Bill No. 169 of the 80th Session was presented and passed, which \nestablished the Maternal Mortality Review Committee. \n \nIt was important to pass that legislation because maternal mortality was, and \ncontinues to be, rising in the U.S. as it declines elsewhere. We continue to be \nthe only high-resource Country whose rates are rising. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nBlack women face significantly higher maternal mortality risk with 44 deaths per \n100,000  live  births  compared  to  their  White  counterparts.  Women  of  other \nraces are at 13 to 14 deaths per every 100,000 live births. \n \nThis is 2021, and we are still battling maternal mortality issues as we come out \nof the Covid-19 pandemic. During the beginning of the pandemic, women found \nthemselves forced to deliver without their partners and/or family members. That \nwas needed for the safety and protection of hospital staff and other patients, \nand the decision was warranted. It placed undue stress on families and the \npregnant woman as she went into labor and delivery. \n \nPeople were looking for options and reached out to me, asking for information \non  freestanding  birthing  centers.  There  were  constituents  in  my  district  not \ncomfortable with giving birth at home but did not feel there were any other \noptions.  \n \nAssembly Bill 287 defines a freestanding birthing center in section 11. \n \nTARA C. RAINES, PH.D., N.C.S.P.: \nAs I show my presentation (Exhibit B) on freestanding birthing centers and why \nthey would be beneficial for Nevadans, I will explain the definition of birthing \ncenters,  the  rise  in  birthing  center  utilization  in  the  U.S.,  some  outcomes \nassociated with birthing centers, potential cost savings, Strong Start data and \nhow birthing centers close the gap on health disparities. \n \nA birthing center is a safe healthcare facility where care is provided using the \nmidwifery model of care. We think of a birthing center as a “Maxi-home vs. a \nMini-hospital.” \n \nBirthing center care is integrated and guided by the principles of prevention, \nsensitivity,  safety,  appropriate  medical  intervention  and  cost-effectiveness. \nUsing the midwifery model of care, the birthing center helps with the transition \nfrom pregnancy to parenthood. \n \nBirthing centers respect and facilitate birthing persons’ rights to make informed \nchoices about their health care and the baby’s based on the parent’s values and \nbeliefs. Birthing centers allow the participation of the birthing person’s family \nand friends in the pregnancy, birth and immediate postpartum period. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nIn recent years, there has been a rise in birthing centers as they are found to \ngive  folks  access  to  the  births  of  their  choice.  In  the  U.S.,  there  are \n384 freestanding birthing centers, 11 of which are operated by Black owners. \nBirthing  centers  saw  19,871  births  in  2018.  Recent  data  shows  roughly \n0.5 percent  of  all  U.S. births  took  place  in  birthing  centers.  This  is  a \n200 percent increase over the past ten years. \n \nBirthing  centers  in  the  midwifery  model  of  care  are  associated  with  lower \ncesarean rates and improved outcomes after birth and postpartum, cost savings \nfor individuals, states and Medicaid systems, and increased client satisfaction. \nThose  choosing  to  deliver  in  birthing  centers  leave  their  births  feeling \nempowered and excited as they enter into the journey of parenthood. \n \nThe U.S. is currently ranked worst of all developed countries in regard to birth \noutcomes.  Mothers  in  the  U.S.  have  a  higher  risk  of  mortality  in  childbirth \ndespite spending more on the childbirth process. We are fifty-fifth in maternal \nmortality and two times higher than 37 other nations. We are thirty-third in \ninfant mortality with 5.8 deaths per 1,000 live births. Racial disparities make \nthis  exponentially  greater.  Nationally,  Medicaid  pays  for  almost  half  of  U.S. \nbirths. \n \nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 40 out of every \n100,000 African-American birthing persons die during childbirth. This is more \nthan three times the rate of their White peers. African Americans are three to \nfour times more likely to suffer a severe disability after childbirth in a hospital. \n \nIn addition to what appears to be a safer option for women of color, birthing \ncenters have demonstrated they are of great value. Among states reporting the \npayer on birth certificates, 42.3 percent of all U.S. births were covered by \nMedicaid.  Current  estimates  suggest  that  rate  in  Nevada  is  60  percent  to \n70 percent of births projected in the coming year will be covered by Medicaid. \nChildbirth is dominated by costly and unnecessary interventions. \n \nToday’s rate of cesarean births is almost 32 percent, which is up 50 percent \nsince 1996, and the rate of inductions has surged in recent years. \n \nA Washington, D.C., Medicaid study estimated cost savings of approximately \n$1,163 per birth using birthing centers and $11.6 million per 10,000 births. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nClark  County  issued  41,000  birth  certificates  last  year.  We  estimated \n60 percent of the Medicaid births were delivered in birthing centers, which is \nnot likely. If this were true, the potential cost savings to Nevada would be \n$28 million. Those numbers are exaggerated; nevertheless, there would be cost \nsavings to Nevada if Medicaid births were delivered in birthing centers. \n \nIf  more  pregnant  beneficiaries  accessed  birthing  centers  for  maternity  care, \nthere would be better birth outcomes, saving Medicaid funds. If an open-access \nmodel was allowed, where patients receive only prenatal care at the birthing \ncenter and then deliver in the hospital, the outcomes would be better. Many \nbirthing centers use a group pregnancy model, which allows folks to develop \ncommunity  during  the  prenatal  period.  This  encourages  breast  feeding  and \nreduces  incidents  of  postpartum  depression.  Medicaid  beneficiaries  have \nexpressed  satisfaction  with  birthing  center  care;  however,  nationally,  only  a \nsmall number of Medicaid beneficiaries are able to access this model for their \nbirths. State regulations, like the ones we are seeking to change today, can lead \nto that limitation. \n \nBirthing centers have been identified in research that looks at the Strong Start \nmodels  of  prenatal  care  as  an  ideal  model  for  promoting  social  support  for \nparents in the early days of pregnancy. Midwifery model of care as delivery in \nbirthing  centers  promotes  the  integration  of  family  and  community  in  the \npregnancy and birthing process, and group prenatal care has been found to \nimprove outcomes for birthing persons. \n \nWhen looking at the Strong Start data on the birthing center midwifery model of \ncare versus national data, we see the American Association of Birth Centers \n(AABC) data shows better outcomes, reducing the incidence of preterm birth, \nlow birth weight, very low birth weight, primary cesarean and total cesarean \nbirths including repeat cesareans. \n \nAs  it  relates  to  race  and  the  Black  maternal  health  crisis,  the  AABC  data \nsuggests  that  for  African-American  birthing  persons,  the  disparities  were \ndiminished, particularly the reduction in cesarean births and low birth weight \nbabies using the birthing center and midwifery model of care. \n \nBirthing center prenatal care is time-intensive and relationship-based. Midwives \nsee fewer clients per day, allowing them to spend more time with the patients \nthey support. This model has been incentivized because of these relationships, \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nand access to resources and support systems result in better outcomes and cost \nsavings to Medicaid. This leads to an increase in body-fed babies, lower rates of \ncesarean, perinatal and postpartum interventions. \n \nThat concludes the testimony on my presentation on birthing centers. I would \nnow like to share a personal story with you. \n \nAfter becoming pregnant, I read and learned about the Black maternal health \ncrisis, learned about high-profile Black women’s difficulty with pregnancy and \nworried about entering the medical system. Serena Williams almost died when \nshe found herself in the hospital with doctors who did not believe her. \n \nI lost that pregnancy after receiving care from a medical provider that was so \negregious,  that  when  reported,  I  received  a  refund  of  all  copays  from  my \ninsurance  provider  in  addition  to  a  letter  of  apology.  When  I  found  myself \npregnant with my oldest daughter, hospital care did not feel safe for me. I did \nnot feel a home birth was a good fit for myself and my family. \n \nAt my first prenatal appointment, my obstetrician told me everything was fine \nand that I was at a 10 percent to 15 percent chance of miscarrying. The next \nday I met with a midwife at a birthing center who said I was doing fine and \nlooking at an 85 percent to 90 percent chance of having a healthy baby. For \nme, it was the emphasis on the health and survival of my baby that empowered \nme to have the best pregnancy possible and made birthing centers a great fit for \nme. At the time, I was living in Colorado and was able to delivery in a birthing \ncenter. \n \nUpon  learning  this  was  not  an  option  for  my  friends  in  Nevada,  I  became \npassionate about promoting equity and access for everyone to have the births \nof their dreams. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN MONROE-MORENO: \nThere are continued conversations between the sponsors and the Department of \nHealth and Human Services (DHHS) about a proposed amendment (Exhibit C). \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nHow many states have certified birthing centers in place? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nGENEVIEVE BURKETT (Director of Nursing, Serenity Birth Center): \nI do not have a nationwide number. \n \nDR. RAINES: \nAt  this  time,  there  are  37  states  with  freestanding  birthing  centers  and \nregulations.  The  vast  majority  of  these  states  use  the  Commission  for  the \nAccreditation of Birth Centers (CABC) guidelines for licensure and regulation. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nAre there requirements for relationships with hospitals in case of emergencies at \na birthing center? The bill references a 30-mile distance allowed, which is a long \nway when someone is in distress. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN MONROE-MORENO: \nYou will hear opposition on the 30-mile distance. When creating the language \nfor the bill, we heard from our rural communities that do not have hospitals, \nwhich  is  the  reason  we  chose  the  30-mile  distance.  In  some  of  our  urban \ncommunities, the nearest hospital is within 10 to 15 miles. The 30-mile distance \nwas added to the bill so there would be some type of medical facility in our rural \ncommunities. \n \nMS. BURKETT: \nWe are required by the State to develop a collaborating transfer relationship \nwith our closest hospital. For us, it is University Medical Center in Las Vegas. \nWe sent a certified letter requesting that relationship, and the center has not \nresponded. The center must receive our patients, and we have a great working \nrelationship  with  the  labor  and  delivery  and  Neonatal  Intensive  Care  Unit \ndepartments. \n \nOur  transfer  rate  is  about  12  percent  of  our  clients.  Perhaps  1  percent  to \n2 percent of those clients are emergent. The remaining are those with prolonged \nlabor or mothers who would like an epidural and would want to transfer. Every \nprenatal  visit  admission  to  the  birthing  center  requires  a  risk  assessment \nfollowing State recommendations for women who risk out of birthing-center \ncare as they must be low risk. We have gone above that and are in line with the \nCABC for the accreditation of birthing centers to ensure the women we care for \nare appropriate for our level of care. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nDR. RAINES: \nThere are those not as excited as we are about this model of empowering and \npromoting equity for birthing persons. For that reason, it was stated that an \nattempt must be made to establish a relationship with a hospital. Requiring the \nrelationship  would  be  prohibitive  and  prevent  people  from  opening  birthing \ncenters  since  that  would  put  owners  and  operators  at  the  mercy  of  the \nhospitals. \n \nSafety is the No. 1 component of this work. There are folks who risk out of \nbirthing centers long before they get to the end of their pregnancy or toward the \nend of their term. Do not think of it as a transfer in the heat of the moment, but \nit includes transfer at 36 weeks because of unregulated blood pressure, or at \n32 weeks  because  an  anomaly  has  been  discovered.  Those  transfers  occur \nbefore labor and delivery. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe mothers giving birth in birthing centers are healthy, have had prenatal care \nand are set up for a successful, healthy outcome. Does the data you cited \ncompare to the broader population of births or those who meet the same criteria \nof those giving birth in a birthing center? \n \nDR. RAINES: \nPart of what makes these mothers healthy and ready for a successful birth is \nthe prenatal care they receive in the birthing center. My first visit included a \nnutrition class focusing on what I should be eating to keep my baby healthy and \nrecourses to find the healthy food. It becomes apples to apples in that the \nmodel of care looks different in a hospital. The data is looking at a general \npopulation of those who went through birthing centers. Everyone does not start \nat a birthing center working out and physically fit; it is the same for those \nstarting their prenatal care at a hospital. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN MONROE-MORENO: \nMy oldest daughter planned her first birth with the service of a midwife and \nhome birth in a pool. I was able to be there and experience the birth while \nremembering giving birth to her. I was in labor when my car broke down on the \nside  of  the  road  between  Arizona  and  California,  taken  by  ambulance  to  a \nhospital and had no one there with me. My doctor had told me I was having \nfalse labor and it was fine for me to travel. I almost died giving birth to my \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \ndaughter because the medical professional in charge at the hospital did not \nbelieve the situation I was in. \n \nMy daughter knew about that and decided to do something different. She had \nmore visits with her midwife than I had with my doctors during any of my \npregnancies.  Her  midwife  advised  her  she  would  gain  weight  during  her \npregnancy and provided her with healthy eating information and an exercise \nroutine. The day my granddaughter was born, my daughter had her midwife, an \nRN in training to be a midwife, a midwife assistant and her best friend present. \nIt was the most relaxing birth I have been a part of. \n \nThey embraced the entire family and spent time to get to know her where \noftentimes our doctors do not have the time to do this. Her midwife also made \nher preregister at the hospital and build a relationship with the doctor so that if \nsomething were to go wrong, they would have that easy transfer. She had that \noption so many of our mothers do not have. \n \nAMBER FALGOUT (Battle Born Progress): \nBattle Born Progress supports A.B. 287. This bill prioritizes women and their \noptions for giving birth in Nevada. As a mother, I recognize the importance of \nchoosing the birthing plan that is right for you and your family. There are much \nbetter outcomes for newborns and mothers when mothers are given a choice in \nhow to set up the birthing plan that works best for them. \n \nAssembly Bill 287 will help make birthing centers a viable option for mothers \nand their babies. \n \nJIMMY LAU (Dignity Health-St. Rose Dominican): \nDignity  Health  submitted  a  letter  (Exhibit  D)  from  G.  Rodney  Buzzas,  Chief \nMedical  Officer,  which  outlines  our  concerns.  The  first  one  is  the  distance \nrequired  from  the  birthing  center  to  the  hospital.  Thirty  miles  is  too  far, \nfive miles would be a better alternative. \n \nWe  are  concerned  about  the  lack  of  a  qualified  provider  for  a  higher-level \nintervention that may be necessary during birth. Intubating an infant is generally \na difficult task that would require a qualified provider. \n \nThe birthing center should have a bona fide relationship with a hospital for \nneeded transfers. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nLYNN CHAPMAN (Nevada Families for Freedom): \nThe Nevada Families for Freedom opposes a portion of A.B. 287. I will read \nfrom my written testimony (Exhibit E) in opposition. \n \nBOB RUSSO: \nI oppose changing the wording on the birth certificate where A.B. 287 refers to \nmothers as the person giving birth and fathers as the other persons. I fail to \nunderstand the reason for this change. We are here because of our biological \nmothers and fathers—to think otherwise is delusional. I grew up in an American \nItalian household where family is everything; mother, father, aunt, uncle and \ncousins. Each had their part to play in the family dynamic. I see the language \nadopted  in  the  bill  as  another  step  toward  undermining  the  family,  another \nattempt to minimize the family unit which is the basis and foundation upon \nwhich a civil society exists. In many parts of the Country, fathers are absent \nfrom the lives of young adolescents. If you want to reduce crime, strengthen \nthe family and improve the education of our children. \n \nThe thought of referring to my father as the other person is nauseating, even if \njust on the birth certificate. It is distasteful to my mother, who will be 97 years \nold  later  this  month,  to  refer  to  her  as  the  person  giving  birth.  Where  are \npeople’s rights to be called mothers and fathers on record and to be proud of \nthat fact? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN MONROE-MORENO: \nI appreciate the comments from Dignity Health. I drove from my house to the \nhospitals near me and there is not a hospital within five miles of my urban \nhome, which makes five miles unreasonable. \n \nPregnant  people  cannot  utilize  a  birthing  center  if  they  are  experiencing  a \nhigh-level  birth.  Mothers  are  monitored  throughout  the  course  of  their \npregnancy,  and  if  for  any  reason  a  mother  should  be  in  a  better  place  for \ndelivery, the mother is transferred to the hospital early in the pregnancy. \n \nThe birthing center in Las Vegas has tried to build a relationship with University \nMedical Center, and the hospital has not been amenable. I would encourage, \nwelcome and applaud hospitals working with birthing centers to build those \nrelationships. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nThe world we live in has changed. I am adopted and have been looking for my \nbirth mother and father for a number of years. I wanted to find out who they \nwere for health reasons and to thank them for the choices they made. My \nparents are on my birth certificate, but my daughter and her wife are not a \nmother and father. This is the reason for the gender-neutral language in the bill. \nWhen hospitals make comments that there are better outcomes with births in \nhospitals, while I appreciate their opinions, the data does not support this. \n \nDR. RAINES: \nThe  opposition  stated  infant  intubation  cannot  happen  at  birthing  centers.  I \nwould like to clarify that midwives are trained in infant intubation. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 287 and open the hearing on A.B. 326. \n \nASSEMBLY  BILL  326  (2nd  Reprint):  Revises  provisions  governing  cannabis. \n(BDR 56-641) \n \nASSEMBLYMAN TOM ROBERTS (Assembly District No. 13): \nToday I will be presenting A.B. 326 which revises the provisions governing \ncannabis. I will also be covering the proposed amendment (Exhibit F). \n \nThere are 36 states that have legalized medical marijuana and 15 states that \nhave regulated adult use cannabis programs. Despite this, there is a thriving \nillegal market for marijuana and the reason is simple economics. Last April, the \nLas Vegas  Metropolitan  Police  Department  announced  its  largest  indoor \nmarijuana grow operation bust of over 5,700 individual plants weighing more \nthan 860 pounds valued at nearly $9 million. \n \nThere are consequences to the black market. Unlicensed cannabis producers \nand retailers compete against legal dispensaries with lower tax collection and \nimpact to State revenue. In fiscal year 2019-2020, State sales tax on cannabis \nproducts  amounted  to  $53  million.  The  illegal  operation  I  mentioned  was \nproducing close to $20 million a year tax-free. In addition, there is violent crime \nassociated with the illicit black market. \n \nMarijuana industry owners complain about how the black market continues to \nthrive in Las Vegas. From my time at the police department, we saw a decline in \njury appeal for marijuana cases on the criminal side because it is now legal in \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nNevada. I talked to prosecutors in the high-density drug trafficking section in the \nDistrict Attorney’s Office who highlighted things I had already known. Although \nwe  were  getting  some  criminal  prosecution,  it  was  not  as  much  as  it  was \npreviously. They focused on going after those with violent priors, and many \ncases were not being prosecuted. As a result, law enforcement did not have an \nappetite to police this. \n \nOne  prosecutor  recommended  I  contact  the  State  Contractors’  Board.  The \ngentleman  who  runs  the  enforcement  division  happens  to  be  an  ex-drug \nenforcement agent supervisor. He said they have civil infractions that go along \nwith their criminal infractions, one of which goes after advertisers. You must \nadvertise  a  specific  way,  and  if  this  is  not  done,  the  Board  can  go  after \nadvertisers criminally and civilly; however, this bill only applies to civil penalties. \nIf you conduct contracting business without a license, the Board has the ability \nto fine you. That money goes into the education program to educate the public \non licensed and unlicensed contractors. It also helps support the enforcement \neffort. \n \nI took NRS 624.720 and NRS 624.700 and drafted A.B. 326. This bill mirrors \nthose  statues  providing  civil  infractions  that  would  give  law  and  code \nenforcement, the people trying to regulate the unregulated market, a tool other \nthan criminal prosecution to those operating a business without a license and/or \nunlawful advertising. \n \nSection  1.5,  subsection  1  defines  the  civil  penalty  action  to  be  taken  and \nprovides the money collected for the fine will be deposited into the city or \ncounty treasury. The district or city attorney will manage those violations. \n \nSection 2, subsection 11, paragraph (f) added language to allow the Cannabis \nBoard to regulate advertising. The Board will work with the industry so as not to \nbe burdensome, allowing consumers to know it is a legitimate business they are \nordering from. \n \nIn section 1.5, we left out the word advertise. I will be seeking an amendment \nto add that back in. \n \nWe  had  people  asking  for  cleanup  language  on  receivership  for  these \nbusinesses.  We  amended  the  bill  on  the  Assembly  Floor  but  did  not  get \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \neverything  into  the  bill  we  needed,  which  is  the  reason  for  the  proposed \namendment, Exhibit F. \n \nJOHN SANDE, IV (United Asset Management Services): \nUnited  Asset  Management  Services  is  the  first  court-appointed  receiver  to \noperate  in  the  cannabis  industry.  There  may  have  been  one  prior  to  us  in \nWashington. Receiverships are important when a business falls on hard times or \ncreditors feel a business is not being run as it should. We have bankruptcy to \nprotect business and creditors. In our instance, the business filed for bankruptcy \nprotection and was rejected because under federal law cannabis is an illegal \nsubstance.  The  bankruptcy  court  felt  the  federal  protections  for  those \nbusinesses did not apply to those types of businesses. The case was pushed to \nState court, which granted a receivership. As a result, we realized there were \nno laws that addressed this situation. \n \nIn  working  with  the  Office  of  the  Attorney  General  and  the  Cannabis \nCompliance Board (CCB), we put together language giving the CCB the authority \nto  establish  qualifications  for  receiverships.  The  minimum  qualifications  you \nwould expect a receiver to have is to fix the situation as a bankruptcy trustee \nmight  do.  The  amendment,  Exhibit  F,  gives  flexibility  to  the  CCB.  The  bill \noriginally stated they “shall” adopt regulations that establish those sections put \ninto the bill. The amendment changes the wording to “may” adopt regulations \nand gives the CCB discretion, which the CCB felt would be the best. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nUnder what process is an individual found to be liable for a violation? Who \nmakes the determination on appeal rights for that person? \n \nASSEMBLYMAN ROBERTS: \nThe premise was to give the local courts jurisdiction. For instance, in the City of \nHenderson, it could be police officers or code enforcement who would issue a \ncivil citation to those engaged in the actions highlighted in the bill and then go \nthrough the normal civil process. The original idea was to give the jurisdiction to \nthe CCB Board; however, the Board lacks the civil attorneys and/or processes at \nthis time, which is why we went with the local courts. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nAre there time limits for how long an establishment can be in receivership? Is \nthere anything prohibiting a receiver from taking over full ownership? \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nMR. SANDE, IV: \nReceivership is an equitable remedy of the court. The court presides over the \nreceivership estate, and everything must be approved through the receivership. \nAt this point in our case, the receiver has inventoried the assets, established \nrelationships with cultivators and brought the company to a position where it \ncould be transferred and sold to allow the creditors and employees who were \nowed back pay to recoup some of their money. That is in the process of being \napproved by the court. If the court wanted to establish limitations, it would \nhave the discretion under its equitable powers to do so. \n \nI am not aware of anything in the law that would require a certain period of \ntime. The complexity of the business would determine how difficult of a case it \nwould be to reestablish the business or what would need to happen in the best \ninterest of the creditors and the receivership. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nAt  the  court’s  discretion,  you  move  out  of  receivership  and  into  a  new \nownership structure. Are there opportunities for the receiver to convert into full \nownership, or is a receivership a temporary management contract? \n \nMR. SANDE, IV: \nI  am  not  aware  that  a  receivership  would  become  a  full-time  owner.  The \nreceiver is awarded and acts on behalf of the court. Typically, receiverships act \nsimilar to a trustee in bankruptcy where its job is to act on behalf of the court to \nreestablish the business and protect the assets in an organized fashion so they \ncan be transferred or liquidated. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThere are licenses and permits for an establishment. Does the receiver run the \nbusiness so it does not go down in value while waiting for someone to take \nover? \n \nMR. SANDE, IV: \nIn most cases, it would work that way. For our example, the language would \ncreate a new agent card for receivership designation. The receiver has to obtain \nits own registered agent card and have the background check the CCB required \nof it to step in and operate the business. His charge from the court was to \nreestablish the business and protect the assets to the extent possible. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIf I was a receiver and wanted to keep the profits, is there a time limit on \ngetting money back? \n \nMR. SANDE, IV: \nThe receiver does not get to keep profits, they are putting them back into the \nbusiness. They are able to charge an hourly fee, and those fees are reviewed by \nthe court for reasonableness. The creditors have an opportunity to file protests \nif they feel anything is unreasonable, and the judge would be the person signing \noff on whether the fees were reasonable. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nAre these transactions cash-heavy? \n \nMR. SANDE, IV: \nMarijuana  is  in  large  part  a  cash-heavy  business.  In  most  instances,  it  is \ncompletely cash. There are some financial institutions that do accept debit cards \nand other financial arrangements some of the cannabis companies have. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nI do not see discussion about how the $50,000 fine should be assessed. Is it \nbased  on  quantity  or  number  of  violations?  What  factors  are  taken  into \nconsideration to determine whether the fine is zero or up to $50,000? \n \nASSEMBLYMAN ROBERTS: \nWe modeled this after the language of the State Contractors’ Board. The Board \nbases it on the number of violations, size of the company and so on. Those are \nall factors taken into account by the hearing officer or judge. In that statute, it \nis silent and leaves discretion to those presiding over the hearings. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nIn the Board example, it is the Board that issues the fine, correct? We have the \ndistrict attorney or city attorney issuing the fine. \n \nASSEMBLYMAN ROBERTS: \nThat is correct. It would be code enforcement and/or a business licensing entity \nthat manages those businesses in those districts in concert with the city or \ndistrict attorney. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nMIKE CATHCART (City of Henderson): \nThe City of Henderson supports A.B. 326. Having another option to stop the \nillegal sale of cannabis is welcomed and helps lower the level of black market \nproduct competing with the well-regulated legal cannabis industry. \n \nCHAD CHRISTENSEN: \nI am part owner of Pisos Dispensary in Clark County. California has had up to \n70 percent of the market of cannabis consumed illegally. If we considered that \nfact, the cannabis market may be the second-largest taxpayer in Nevada. We \nhave two concerns; one is public health and the other is revenue to the State. \n \nBlack  market  or  illegal  cannabis  is  not  tested,  and  the  Legislature  ensures \nNevada has the most robust testing system to protect patients, consumers and \nvisitors to our State. If someone assumes they are buying a legal product which \nis not legal and is detrimental to their health, it becomes bad national press. \n \nWe need to ensure the revenue from the sale of cannabis goes to the State, the \nschools and the programs we are working hard to fund. Imagine we cut the \nillegal  number  in  half  in  Nevada  to  35  percent;  that  would  be  a  significant \namount going to the State. This bill is a step in that direction. \n \nLAYKE MARTIN (Nevada Dispensary Association): \nThe  Nevada  Dispensary  Association  supports  A.B.  326.  We  want  to  thank \nAssemblyman  Roberts  for  providing  additional  tools  to  combat  dealers  who \nmarket to organized crime. We are grateful for the flexibility to work with the \nindustry to ensure required identification on advertising would not be a burden \nsince  the  industry  will  help  consumers  distinguish  ads  for  licensed  versus \nunlicensed  businesses.  We  support  the  amendment  language  to  establish  a \nprocess for receivership. As federal bankruptcy protection is not an option for \ncannabis businesses, statutory language and CCB regulations will help provide \nguidance  for  insolvent  businesses  and  receiverships  within  the  cannabis \nindustry. \n \nASSEMBLYMAN ROBERTS: \nThis  was  a  work  in  progress  as  it  came  out  of  drafting,  and  a  number  of \nchanges were made. We will make additional changes and are agreeable to any \nthe  Committee  may  have.  My  objective  is  to  give  people  a  tool  to  lead \nunsuspecting tourists away from sites such as Weedmaps who skirt legitimate \nbusinesses in Nevada. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 326 and open the hearing on A.B. 374. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 374 (1st Reprint): Establishes the Statewide Substance Use \nResponse Working Group. (BDR 40-991) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN JILL TOLLES (Assembly District No. 25): \nI am here today to present A.B. 374. In November of last year, the National \nDrug Helpline placed Nevada as one of 28 states on red alert for increased risk \nof death from overdoses of opioids and other drugs. The Covid-19 pandemic \nhas amplified the existing opioid crisis. According to DHHS, Nevada has seen a \n50 percent increase in opioid and fentanyl-involved drug overdose deaths since \nthe onset of the pandemic. \n \nThe  National  Safety  Council  reports  overdoses  kill  more  of  us  than  breast \ncancer, guns and car crashes combined. Our family was impacted by this crisis \nwhen one of our family members developed a dependency to pain medications \nafter an accident at work. This led to dependency on street drugs and tragically \nended with an overdose just before Christmas 2007. \n \nIn  2017,  626  Nevadans  lost  their  lives,  impacting  countless  brothers  and \nsisters,  mothers  and  fathers,  children,  spouses  and  friends.  Addiction  is \ntreatable and preventable. There are 23 million people in recovery in the U.S. \ntoday. Recovery is not only possible but probable if one receives the right type \nof treatment and has access to support services. \n \nAssembly Bill 374 establishes the Statewide Substance Use Response Working \nGroup  under  the  Office  of  the  Attorney  General.  After  discussions  with \nstakeholders,  there  was  a  strong  cry  to  convene  an  ongoing  Statewide \ncoordinated effort ensuring each entity is working in collaboration to identify \ngaps and employee evidence-based best practices to tackle issues of substance \nuse disorder, behavioral health and other co-occurring disorders across Nevada. \nThis bill is based on the direct input of the Attorney General, the Office of the \nAttorney General, DHHS, the National Association of Counties, Shatterproof and \nrepresentatives of the mental health and recovery, prevention and treatment \ncommunity. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nSections 5 through 7 establish the Nevada Statewide Substance Use Response \nWorking Group adding membership, service requirements and other functions of \nthe Working Group. \n \nSection 6, subsection 2, outlines the membership of the group including the \nAttorney  General  or  appointee,  the  Director  of  DHHS  or  appointee, \nrepresentatives of local governments from Washoe, Clark and rural counties, \nlaw enforcement, health care recovery treatment and prevention communities, \nand Legislators. \n \nIt  is  my  intention  to  add  an  amendment  to  the  bill  that  would  include \nrepresentation from a hospital, considering hospitals are often on the frontlines, \nparticularly in the emergency rooms, as well as K-12 representation per the \nrequest of the Clark County Education Association. \n \nSection 10 outlines the duties of the group including making recommendations \nto DHHS on the use of monies and reporting to the Governor, Attorney General, \nAdvisory Commission on the Administration of Justice and the Director of the \nLegislative Counsel Bureau. \n \nSection  10.5  requires  DHHS  submit  a  report  concerning  the  use  of  money \nreceived by the State from settlements, civil actions, gifts, grants or donations, \nand  all  other  money  spent  by  the  State  and  each  political  subdivision  for \npurposes  relating  to  substance  misuse  and  substance  use  disorders  to  the \nWorking Group annually. \n \nSection  14  states  this  legislation  will  become  effective  upon  passage  and \napproval. \n \nSTEPHANIE WOODARD, PSY.D. (Senior Advisor on Behavioral Health, Division of \nPublic and Behavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services): \nThe issues around substance use, misuse and addiction are complex and often \ninvolve an interplay between individual risk factors and environmental, social \nand economic conditions. Just as there is no one single driver contributing to \nthe rising rates of substance misuse, addiction and overdose, there is also no \none single solution. \n \nDuring the preliminary work to address the methamphetamine and opioid crises, \nit  was  clear  Nevada  needed  to  implement  strategies  that  crossed  multiple \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nsectors  including  medicine,  law  enforcement,  prevention,  public  health,  and \naddiction treatment and recovery services. Such efforts led to the creation of \nthe  previous  Attorney  General’s  Substance  Abuse  Working  Group  and  the \nsunsetted  Governor’s  Opioid  Accountability  Task  Force  meetings  where \nstakeholders engaged in data-driven discussions, supported needed policy and \nprogram development and implementation, reduced duplication of efforts and \nbrought accountability and transparency to the process. \n \nThis  intentional  work  across  systems  has  led  to  coordinated  strategies  to \naddress  the  crises  at  hand.  As  Nevada  faces  new  challenges  related  to \nsubstance use addiction and overdose, we have seen it is not sufficient to \nestablish groups to singularly focus on one issue or substance at a time. We \nneed a comprehensive and collaborative approach. \n \nThe proposed Statewide Substance Response Working Group in A.B. 374 brings \nstakeholders together to develop comprehensive, evidence-based strategies and \nrecommendations for preventions, early intervention, treatment, recovery, harm \nreduction, data sharing, criminal justice intervention and public policy. The focus \nof  the  Working  Group  will  leverage  and  expand  current  efforts  across \ndepartments and agencies to prevent and reduce substance use and enhance \nefforts through coordination and collaboration. It will introduce evidence-based \nprevention  and  intervention  efforts  to  significantly  reduce  the  burden  of \nsubstance use.  \n \nRecommendations from the Working Group will include primary, secondary and \ntertiary prevention, access to harm reduction intervention services and overdose \nprevention strategies. This group will assess and evaluate existing pathways to \ntreatment  and  recovery.  It  will  work  to  understand  how  Nevadans  access \ntreatment and recovery support services from various points for individuals who \ninterface with law enforcement or the criminal justice system. There will be a \nspecific emphasis on deflection and diversion from the criminal justice system. \n \nThis  Group  will  also  work  to  improve  and  expand  evidence-based  or \nevidence-informed practices, procedures, and strategies for the treatment and \nsupport  of  individuals  in  recovery  as  well  as  specific  recommendations  for \nspecial populations. \n \nThe Working Group will support systems and programs for persons in recovery \nand  recommend  processes  and  regulations  to  ensure  medications  including \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nopioids  and  other  controlled  substances  are  prescribed  appropriately  and  in \naccordance  with  existing  NRS.  The  Group  will  examine  qualitative  and \nquantitative data to understand the risk factors contributing to substance use \nand  the  rates  of  substance  use  and  addiction  in  Nevada,  including  across \ndiverse  and  special  populations.  The  Group  will  develop  strategies  and \nimplementation plans to prevent and respond to overdose, set the efficacy and \nexpand  implementations  of  programs  to  educate  youth  and  families  about \nsubstance use and reduce harm associated with drug use. \n \nThis  Group  will  improve  coordination  between  local,  State,  federal  law \nenforcement agencies and public health entities to enhance the communication \nof timely and relevant information and data. It will also evaluate current systems \nfor sharing information between departments and agencies for the trafficking \nand  distribution  of  licit  and  illicit  substances.  It  will  study  the  effects  of \nsubstance abuse on the criminal justice system, the methods and resources to \nprevent  the  manufacture,  trafficking  and  sale  of  substances,  and  the \neffectiveness of criminal and civil penalties, ultimately evaluating the impact of \nsubstance use disorders on the economy. \n \nThis Group will work to study, evaluate and provide recommendations toward \nthe opioid settlement litigation funds the State will receive through the Office of \nthe Attorney General. \n \nIn the absence of these formal convening groups, we have worked diligently to \nbring partners and invested stakeholders together to have these conversations, \ncontinuing to use the momentum developed in previous working groups, which \nhas proven to be a challenge. Having a formal convening group to bring the \nnecessary individuals together to do this important work will help Nevada make \nthe necessary progress in addressing substance use. \n \nCHRISTINE  JONES  BRADY  (Second  Assistant  Attorney  General,  Office  of  the \nAttorney General): \nThe  Office  of  the  Attorney  General  supports  A.B. 374  and  is  thankful  to \nAssemblywoman Tolles for this bipartisan bill. Drug abuse and addiction knows \nno boundaries or parties. Who has not been personally impacted by problematic \nsubstance use or addiction? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nThe Office of the Attorney General will support this endeavor and the Substance \nUse Response Group by providing meeting space and ensuring public meetings \ncomply with open meeting laws. \n \nThis Working Group consists of a diverse and dynamic group of professionals \nand citizens who will work hard to combat this Statewide problem. \n \nSARAH ADLER (Vitality Unlimited; New Frontier Treatment Center): \nMy colleague Helen Foley had to leave so I will present her testimony in support \nof A.B. 374 from FirstMed Health and Wellness Center. In addition to traditional \nmedical care, we provide mental health and substance addiction services to \napproximately 1,200 patients monthly. While we are proud of the services we \nprovide, there are many roadblocks to quality care. A strong working group can \nhelp alleviate some of these problems to streamline the process and provide \ngreater  access  with  better  outcomes  to  low-income  and  underserved \npopulations. \n \nSome  opportunities  include  providing  reimbursement  for  supportive  services, \nsuch  as  case  management  for  patients  with  substance  use  disorders,  and \nallowing  group  therapy  and  peer  support  for  medication-assisted  treatment \nprograms removing the barrier for dispensing suboxone for medication-assisted \ntreatment-certified providers. The program should also pay for the initial phase \nof suboxone induction to prevent barriers to initiating care. \n \nMany children and families come as a referral from schools, the Department of \nChild and Family Services, and the juvenile justice system. Because we connect \nour patients to external resources and have a robust group of providers, we are \nable to give a perspective of the lower-income patients generally affected by \nsubstance  use.  We  would  like  a  seat  at  the  table  or  to  join  an  advisory \ncommittee as the Working Group moves forward on this critical issue. \n \nI will now give testimony for Vitality Unlimited and New Frontier Treatment \nCenter supporting A.B. 374. \n \nAddressing  substance  use  disorders  requires  active  work  in  prevention, \nresidential  treatment  and  community-based  care  to  support  recovery.  The \nSubstance Use Disorder Working Group proposal uses recognition of State and \nlocal entities throughout its language. We would like to cast a light on rural, \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nfrontier, tribal and diverse communities and populations as specific communities \nwe are confident will be addressed by this Working Group. \n \nThere  is  a  need  to  look  at  workforce  development.  The  Legislature  has \naddressed the need for developing the behavioral health workforce. There is \nspecific  need  related  to  licensed  alcohol  and  drug  counselors  and  licensed \nclinical alcohol and drug counselors. In Nevada, stigma is falling away from \nmental illness. We have developed many licensed professions that work with \nmental illness but are falling behind in our licensing of the alcohol and drug \nworkforce. \n \nWe appreciate the support for Senate Bill (S.B.) 181, which removes one of the \nbarriers mentioned earlier, and encourage the work of Assemblywoman Tolles \nand this bill to look at workforce development. \n \nSENATE BILL 181 (1st Reprint): Revises provisions relating to alcohol and drug \ncounselors. (BDR 54-558) \n \nGEORGE A. ROSS (Hospital Corporation of America): \nHospital Corporation of America supports A.B. 374. All too often, hospitals see \nthe unfortunate results of substance addiction and treat this issue every day. \nThis bill is an impressive approach to helping address this problem by putting a \ngroup of people together that has been well chosen and blends into how the \nState works and how the group will meet and be supported. \n \nMR. LAU: \nDignity Health-St. Rose Dominican supports A.B. 374. Hospitals are in a unique \nposition in this nexus, largely because hospitals encounter people who may not \nhave access to other healthcare options. An example would be a person who \nmay not have a primary care provider ending up in an emergency room. At that \npoint, hospitals have the ability to intervene and take steps to get that person \ninto care. Dignity Health participates in this through various programs including \nits Empowered Program which focuses on pregnant women. \n \nCOURTNEY HUNTER (Shatterproof): \nShatterproof is a national nonprofit dedicated to reversing the addiction crisis \nand supports A.B. 374 for its impact on substance use and addiction in Nevada. \nAt Shatterproof, we are focused on evidence-based solutions to ending this \ncrisis. Having a stakeholder working group reviewing the data, assessing the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nevidence and making informed solutions based on that evidence is a critical step \nforward, ultimately saving lives. A number of our core programs include looking \nat and assessing treatment quality, advancing behavioral health and integrating \nit into primary care settings. \n \nWe worked with Johns Hopkins University to provide guiding principles around \nhow  states  are  spending  opioid  settlement  dollars.  One  of  the  principles  is \nspending money to save lives. That means having dedicated funds making sure \nwe are replacing dollars. Another principle is focusing on racial equity. We are \naccomplishing  that  through  this  stakeholder  advisory  group  pulling  together \ndifferent types of community stakeholders to have a voice and seat at the table. \nIf we not are alive, we cannot recover. \n \nThe final principle is transparency. Having the reporting mechanism within this \ngroup is an asset, providing a transparent record for the State and the Country. \n \nKELSEY MATTHEWS (Shatterproof): \nI  am  23  years  old  and  a  Shatterproof  Ambassador,  the  national  nonprofit \ndedicated to reversing the addiction and overdose crisis. I am the founder of \nTreasuring Tracey, an addiction and overdose platform created in memory of my \nmother who passed away of an accidental drug overdose in 2016. \n \nI have been blessed to have worked with many organizations in Las Vegas, \nincluding  Teen  Challenge.  I  serve  on  the  Board  of  Directors  at  Hope \nCompassionate  Healthcare,  a  nonprofit  organization  founded  to  provide \ncomprehensive and integrated health care and filling the gaps in our healthcare \nsystem. \n \nPersonal life experiences have inspired me to join the fight against the addiction \ncrisis and to pursue social work and a law degree to make an impact on the \nlives of others. Addiction is a family disease. The entire family unit suffers, \nwhich I can attest to firsthand. As a child, I was parentified over my mother and \nher struggle with addiction and functioned as one of her primary caretakers \nalongside my grandparents. This continued until her death in 2016 when I was \n17 years old. I have seen things no child should see—witnessing my mother \nrepeatedly overdose, finding myself at the hands of drug dealers and countless \nunimaginable things including being born addicted to cocaine. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \nPeople  are  dying,  families  are  broken  and  children  are  losing  their  parents. \nParents are burying their children. The crisis is a pandemic in and of itself. We \nneed to get to the root of the problem in all its forms. \n \nLooking back, I can see gaps in the system that exist today. There were times \nmy mother looked for help and there was a severe lack of resources available to \nher  for  receiving  adequate  treatment  from  medical  and  mental  health \nprofessionals.  She  was  stigmatized  and  denied  care  due  to  insurance  and \nfinancial reasons or providers being understaffed and unprepared. This is a sad \nreality in our communities. \n \nThe creation of the Statewide task force is necessary in the fight against this \ncrisis. To be successful will take a team effort. We need a diverse team of \npeople  from  all  different  backgrounds  who  possess  lived  experience  with \nsubstance abuse disorders. Getting to the root of the crisis is going to require \nmany  things,  including  promoting  and  providing  adequate  and  specialized \nbehavioral  health  treatment  and  counseling.  We  need  to  ensure  we  have \nproperly educated medical professionals and care providers with wraparound \nresources available to support families; work to reduce the stigma attached to \nsubstance use; and ensure patients seeking care are treated fairly and with \ncompassion. \n \nBy creating a Statewide task force, we are giving people a chance to have their \nvoices heard while coming together to be a part of the solution. In a time where \ndivision is running rampant, we need to stand united and work together to make \na change in our communities. \n \nI made my mother a promise that I would not allow her death to be in vain and \none day I would use her story, our story, to make a difference. \n \nBRENDA PEARSON, PH.D. (Clark County Education Association): \nThe Clark County Education Association (CCEA) supports A.B. 374 as amended. \nAt the beginning of the pandemic, we realized stay-at-home orders were going \nto open up the potential for increased substance abuse. We must look at how \nwe can work together as a community to put people and students in recovery \ntogether as we address substance abuse and overdose with our mental and \nbehavioral professionals, wraparound services and programs preventing opioids \non campus. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \nThis  Working  Group  will  address  substance  abuse  in  our  education  system \nthrough the addition of a representative of K-12 education. Additionally, we \nhave  the  opportunity  to  discuss  and  implement  best  practices  leading  to \nproactive support to address this issue. Clark County’s Mission High School, the \nfirst  comprehensive  secondary  school  designed  for  students  recovering  from \nsubstance abuse, use and/or dependency, has brought hope and support to \nstudents in need. By adding K-12 to this Working Group, we can look at the \nsuccesses of Mission High School and distribute health and human service and \npublic outreach across the State to replicate the program. \n \nAs educators, we must do everything in our power to put our student’s health \nfirst. The CCEA looks forward to supporting the development of this Working \nGroup. \n \nDAGNY STAPLETON (Nevada Association of Counties): \nThe  Nevada  Association  of  Counties  supports  A.B.  374.  We  appreciate  the \ninclusion of county human services representatives and county law enforcement \nto the Working Group. There is an important nexus between the opioid crisis \nand many of the services counties provide including emergency response and \nhuman services. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN TOLLES: \nThis is meaningful legislation for myself and so many others. I will offer an \namendment and open the invitation for anyone else to join as a cosponsor. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 374 and open the hearing on A.B. 278. \n \nASSEMBLY  BILL  278  (1st  Reprint):  Provides  for  the  collection  of  certain \ninformation from physicians. (BDR 54-771) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN BEA DURAN (Assembly District No. 11): \nI am here today to present A.B. 278 and will read from my written testimony \n(Exhibit G). \n \nMAYA HOLMES (Health Care Research Manager, Culinary Health Fund): \nNevada has one of the largest physician shortage areas in the U.S.; we are \nforty-fifth in the Nation in providers per capita and fiftieth for primary providers. \nNevada ranks forty-eighth in the Country for clinical care, forty-fourth for access \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \nto  care,  forty-second  due  to  adults  avoiding  care  because  of  cost  and \nforty-seventh in the Nation for quality of care. \n \nLittle is known about the specific market forces that may impact the physician \nshortage, access to affordability and quality, including basic information such as \nwho owns or has purchased a physician practice in the State. Ownership of \nphysician practices has changed dramatically over the last decade. In 2019, the \nAmerican Medical Association announced that more physicians were employed \nthan were independent for the first time. This is from national data based on \nperiodic surveys. We do not have a comprehensive picture of our State that \ndemonstrates trends in Nevada’s healthcare market. \n \nSome  reports  indicate  hospitals  now  employ  physicians  who  have  been  in \nprivate practice because of increasing overhead, reimbursement issues and the \nadministrative responsibilities of ownership. The employment status of doctors \nmay affect patient access. One study found employed physicians typically see \nfewer patients in a day on average than private practice physicians. Physician \nemployment status can affect affordability. According to one study, hospital \nacquisitions of physicians increase physician prices an average of 14 percent, \n33.5  percent  for  cardiologists  and  20  percent  for  orthopedic  providers. \nNumerous studies have shown private equity ownership of physician practices \nleads to higher prices. \n \nPhysician ownership can also affect referral patterns. A Stanford study showed \nphysicians increased referrals to the hospitals who employed them and patients \nwere more likely to be treated at a high-cost, low-quality hospital when their \nadmitting physicians practice is owned by a hospital. \n \nAssembly Bill 278 will allow policy makers, providers, patients and payers to \nunderstand critical trends in Nevada’s healthcare market and their impact on \nphysician  volume,  entity  and  practice.  This  bill  adds  to  existing  licensing \nrenewal  and  biennial  registration  requirements,  an  internet  link  to  a  form \ndeveloped by DHHS for physicians to indicate whether a physician is employed \nor  independent,  and  if  employed,  where  the  physician  practices  and  which \nentity owns that practice. \n \nThe Board of Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine \nare to include a link to these data requests and applications for license renewal \nand biennial registration. Applicants are required to respond but not subject to \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 27 \n \ndisciplinary action or licensure or registration refusal for failure to do so. Any \nreporting  on  this  data  would  be  aggregated  to  protect  provider  privacy \nrequirements and not reveal the identity of the physician. \n \nAssembly Bill 278 requires DHHS to collect and maintain the information and \nprepare an annual report regarding physician practice and employment trends in \nNevada  and  post  the  report  on  an  internet  website  maintained  by  the \nDepartment. \n \nIt  is  critical  that  policy  makers,  public  and  private  payers,  and  patients \nunderstand the role of entities like private equity and other major players that \nare consolidating the physician market to understand consolidation impact on \naccess  to  quality  and  affordability.  Because  of  our  contracting,  we  know \nNeonatal Intensive Care Units and emergency room physician groups are now \nowned by private equity groups. We would like to see how that impacts price, \naccess and contracting status over time. Without any reporting of who owns \nthese and other practices, such trends will be impossible to evaluate. \n \nThe intent of this legislation is to add a brief data request to already required \nlicensing  registration  reporting  steps.  The  information  will  be  known  to  the \nphysician  and  will  not  add  to  the  administrative  burden.  The  information  is \nalready in the public domain but not available in an aggregated, accessible, \nmeaningful and useful way for policy makers, providers, patients and payers; \nA.B. 278 will provide that. \n \nBOBBETTE BOND (Health Care Policy Director, Culinary Health Fund): \nIn addition to the statistics you have heard today, the Journal of the American \nMedical Association has data on what has been happening with the Covid-19 \ncrisis. There have been more private equity deals happening because of the \nCovid-19 crisis. In 2020, there were over 150 private equity deals closed in the \nsecond half of the year. \n \nThere are many factors that go into quality and access to health care. Nevada is \nstruggling with this issue and physician density. We have been dramatically \nimpacted by private equity acquisitions. As Ms. Holmes stated, we see that in \nour contracts but do not have a way to look at the data all together. Our history \nwith  the  legislative  process  in  the  last  15  years  has  been  healthcare \ntransparency. We worked on hospital reporting and quality reporting, and in \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 28 \n \n2017 and 2019, we worked on prescription drug reporting. Last Session, we \nspent time with price bills, and there will be reporting coming from that. \n \nWe are one of the states that has the least amount of reporting on what is \nhappening in the healthcare market. Health care is becoming a never-ending, \nunfortunate chase to provide access to quality while managing limited dollars. \n \nOne of our solutions it to track the impact of consolidation on pricing in a way \nwe can monitor. This bill would provide a baseline without providing a lot of \nadministrative  overhead  and  without  adding  cost  to  the  system.  Physicians, \nwhen obtaining or renewing their license, provide basic information about who \nthey are employed by. Is it a hospital, a large physician group or a solo practice? \nIf so, what is the name of the practice and how many are in the group? \n \nThis would impact the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners and State \nBoard of Osteopathic Medicine. The limited information is needed for us to get a \nbaseline so we can, over time, better see the impact of what is happening in the \nhealthcare market. We realize if physicians are being licensed for the first time, \nthey may not know how many people or physicians work in their offices; they \nwould have to leave that area on the form blank. \n \nWe originally intended to add this information to the State Board application \nitself.  During  the  last  Assembly  hearing,  the  Medical  Board  proposed  an \namendment to match S.B. 379, which would allow the information from that \nsurvey to be provided in a link the Board has on its application process. This link \nis intended to provide critical information about physician density in way we will \nsee patterns. \n \nSENATE  BILL  379  (1st  Reprint):  Provides  for  the  collection  of  certain  data \nconcerning providers of health care. (BDR 40-457) \n \nThis is more demographic data, not a survey with “yes” and “no” questions. \nThere are no penalties if this information is not reported, but we are hopeful it \nwill be so we have a way to track this information. The DHHS will have a role in \nmaking both of these bills merge together.

COMLOSSY: \nI  will  read  the  summary  of  A.B.  181  and  the  amendments  from  the  work \nsession document (Exhibit E). \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI  have  concerns  about  healthcare  providers  when  a  situation  may  be \ndiscoverable even though it is \"confidential.\" How do we protect the person's \nidentity when it comes from an individual practice versus a hospital? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN SARAH PETERS (Assembly District No. 24): \nI appreciate the question and will pass it on to Dr. Stephanie Woodard who may \nbe more versed in the specifics of this question. \n \nSTEPHANIE WOODARD, PSY.D. (Senior Advisor on Behavioral Health, Division of \nPublic and Behavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services): \nThe intent of the legislation is that regulations will stipulate which providers we \nexpect to make these reports. We are looking for these reports primarily to \ncome from providers within hospital settings not independent practices. This \nlegislation  would  fall  under  Nevada  Revised  Statutes  (NRS)  441A  where \ncommunicable  diseases  and  highly  sensitive  data  need  the  ultimate \nconfidentiality and data protection. The data are transmitted to the Division of \nPublic and Behavioral Health and held by the Office of Analytics. \n \nKYRA MORGAN (Chief Biostatistician, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nDr. Woodard is correct. Our plan would be to utilize existing data processing \nmechanisms we have in place under NRS 441A and extend those to include \nthese data on suicide and suicide attempts. The mechanisms for confidentiality \nare completely in place, and we would hold the data as confidential. We would \nnot  release  anything  in  any  kind  of  public  setting  that  would  allow  for \nreidentification of an individual. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nDoes this only apply to hospitals or is there a provider of health care other than \na hospital that has to do this, for instance, a group practice or an individual \nperson? Are any of those captured in this or is it just hospitals? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 11, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nDR. WOODARD: \nThe intent at this time is just hospitals. The regulations we develop subsequent \nto this legislation would define that and provide further clarity. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nTo provide clarity, it is not explicitly in the bill, but the intent is to only do a \nregulatory process that would lead toward hospitals. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI will be voting no with a right to change my vote. \n \nERIC ROBBINS (Counsel): \nI am providing clarification for our drafting purposes. The bill says a provider of \nhealth care who knows of or provides services to a person who has attempted \nsuicide would be required to report in the manner prescribed by the regulations \nof the State Board of Health. The bill does not expressly provide for the Board \nto  adopt  regulations  that  designate  the  providers,  which  seems  to  be  what \nDr. Woodard  was  saying  would  happen.  I  am  wondering  if  that  should  be \nexplicitly added to the amendment. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAssemblywoman Peters, would you like that language explicitly added to the \namendment,  that  it  is  the  intent  of  the  bill  to  identify  the  providers  in  the \nregulatory process? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS: \nYes, I would appreciate that. I thought in the amendment there was language \nthat clarified facilities or providers which would then have to be defined in the \nregulatory process. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThere are two proposed amendments. \n \nMS. COMLOSSY: \nThe bill page of the work session document, item 2, requires either a provider of \nhealth care or the medical facility in which the healthcare provider works to \nreport required information related to attempted suicide. It does not relate to the \nregulatory  piece.  If  the  intent  is  to  have  the  State  Board  of  Health  adopt \nregulations identifying which types of healthcare providers or provider facilities \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 11, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nmust report this information, then we will add that as an additional amendment \non the record and we can make that happen in the next reprint. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS: \nYes, that works for everyone. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDr.  Woodard  and  Ms.  Morgan,  can  you  implement  this  based  on  this \nconversation? \n \nDR. WOODARD: \nYes, we can. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nMr. Robbins, do you have the intent for drafting the language? \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nYes. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will entertain a motion for A.B. 181. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS MOVED TO AMEND AND DO PASS AS AMENDED \nA.B. 181. \n \n  SENATOR SPEARMAN SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI will vote no, but reserve my right to change my vote during Floor Session. \n \n  THE MOTION CARRIED.

(BDR 57-\n251) \n \nMS. COMLOSSY: \nI will read the summary of S.B. 420 and the amendments from the work session \ndocument (Exhibit H). \n \nSENATOR NICOLE J. CANNIZZARO (Senatorial District No. 6): \nThe version of the conceptual amendment includes the different changes we \nmade to clarify some aspects of the Public Option concerning Medicaid or better \nreimbursements, and who would need to bid on the Public Option. It includes \nthe allowance for multi-employer plans to apply to get federal acceptance to \noffer some of their plans to employees who might otherwise be without health \ninsurance. Additionally, thanks to a question raised by Senator Kieckhefer with \nrespect to the 15 percent for the premium reductions, we did add language to \nclarify that does apply to the Public Option only. It was not intended to apply to \nall health care plans. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will entertain a motion on S.B. 420. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS MOVED TO AMEND AND DO PASS AS AMENDED \nS.B. 420. \n \n  SENATOR SPEARMAN SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWe have incredible tools at our disposal to tackle the uninsured population in \nNevada via continued outreach through Medicaid as well as the eligible but \nunenrolled population for the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange, knowing \nthey have a significant increase in subsidies through the American Rescue Plan \nAct of 2021. Without understanding how we are going to capture some of the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 11, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nother populations of uninsureds, I cannot support the bill at this time based on \nthe disruption we will have in the insurance market. The bill directs the Director \nof the Department of Health and Human Services, the Director of the Silver \nState  Health  Insurance  Exchange  and  the  Commissioner  of  Insurance  in  the \nDepartment of Business and Industry to implement this public health benefit \nplan. We have not heard from them as to either the policy or applicability. I am \nuncomfortable with the bill at this time. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI agree with Senator Kieckhefer. We must continue to use the available tools we \nhave to get as many people covered and eligible for subsidies who have not yet \nsigned up for them. I will promote that the marketplace is unusually open at this \ntime of year. If people need health insurance, they can go to the marketplace \nand see if they qualify for subsidies. There have been numerous efforts to do \nthat and we need to do more. \n \nWe are still missing a whole subset of Nevadans who need another option and \nthis bill for a Public Option is good. I am hopeful this will generate some buzz \nthat will lead people to check out what they qualify for. Even if they do not sign \nup for the Public Option, they may find out they are eligible for Medicaid and a \nsubsidy in the marketplace. I support this bill and realize there is a long lead \ntime to get the actuarial information we need to proceed. That information will \nbe invaluable to this State in terms of how we move forward. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI have heard from people on both sides and understand how some feel it is more \ncomplicated than what we should get into right now. Based upon what has \nhappened to Nevadans, especially during Covid-19 and to the Black, Indigenous \nand People of Color communities, the Larry A. Green Center has an excellent \nreport  that  deals  with  how  communities  of  color  have  been  impacted  by \nCovid-19. We need to make sure people have insurance options. Some will say \nit is not perfect, but we should not let perfect be the enemy of good. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nOne  of  the  concerns  I  have  about  the  Public  Option  is  regarding  people \nbecoming discouraged when they look at 2025 or 2026. We have a virtual \npublic option now that is not as used as we would like it. I will be not be \nsupporting this measure, as well-intentioned as it may be. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 11, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nI think this is a great bill and, unfortunately, needed. If the private sector was \nproviding health care to everyone at a reasonable cost, this bill would not be a \nconsideration. It is not. It is entirely appropriate for the government to step in \nand try to offer something people can afford. We bear the costs when people go \nuninsured. It is our responsibility to make sure there are options out there for \npeople and that they are staying healthy. I will be supporting this bill today. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED. (SENATORS HARDY AND KIECKHEFER VOTED \nNO.) \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will now open the hearing on S.B. 438. \n \nSENATE BILL 438: Revises provisions related to agriculture. (BDR 51-1100) \n \nASHLEY  JEPPSON  (Division  Administrator,  Plant  Industry  Division,  State \nDepartment of Agriculture): \nI am presenting S.B. 438. The goal is for the Department of Agriculture to adopt \nthe produce safety-rule portions of the Food Safety Modernization Act. This is a \nfederal law that requires farms of a designated size and scope to comply with \nthe  Code  of  Federal  Regulations.  They  are  aimed  at  preventive  rather  than \nreactionary measures dealing with produce safety outbreaks. We learned a lot \nfrom outbreaks that have happened on farms or in distribution systems. The \ngoal is for the Department to adopt these produce safety rules so they can be \nenforced on a State level versus under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \n(FDA).  The  bill  also  allows  the  Department  to  react  should  there  be  an \nimmediate public safety risk pertaining to food. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThis bill is moving federal regulations to the State level. Do we have adequate \nresources to do this? \n \nMS. JEPPSON: \nYes. We conducted a survey to gauge whether our producers would prefer to \nsee this on a State level versus having FDA perform the inspections, and it was \nan overwhelming yes for the State. Part of the reason justifying this request is \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 11, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nthat  we  have  to  adopt  the  produce  rules  in  order  for  us  to  receive  federal \nresources. We operate under a cooperative agreement. We have to have this \nadopted in statutes. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSo you need the regulations to draw down the resources? \n \nMS. JEPPSON: \nYes. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nHearing no further testimony, I will close the hearing on S.B. 438. I will open \nthe hearing on A.B. 343. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 343 (1st Reprint): Provides for the development of plans for \nconducting  walking  audits  of  urbanized  areas  in  certain  counties. \n(BDR S-742) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN CLARA THOMAS (Assembly District No. 17): \nI am presenting A.B. 343 in its First Reprint, which is a step toward improving \nthe health of Nevadans. I have submitted my written presentation (Exhibit I). \n \nDAVID CLYDE (Associate General Counsel, Regional Transportation Commission \nof Southern Nevada): \nThe Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada (RTC) is proposing \na  friendly  amendment  to  A.B.  343  that  will  assist  in  effectuating  the  bill's \nobjectives  relating  to  promoting  safer  and  more  livable  communities.  I  have \nsubmitted our proposed amendment (Exhibit J). \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN THOMAS: \nI  urge  the  support  and  use  of  walking  audits  and  better  understanding  of \ncommunity needs. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nHow did you come up with such a wonderful bill? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN THOMAS: \nThe walking audit came from walking the community last summer when we had \nthe devastating prospect of our children not being able to access the internet. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 11, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nWe had little place cards that we put on doors and cars to have parents be able \nto access the internet. With that, I noticed crumbling sidewalks and dimmed \nstreet lamps causing me to be frightened at night because of not knowing if \ndogs would come out. It was suggested by Senator Dina Neal that we should \ndo a walking audit and that is how this bill came about. \n \nEMILY WALSH (Nevada Conservation League): \nWe support A.B.  343. Nevada is the eleventh most dangerous state in the \nNation for pedestrians. We must do a better job of making sure our streets are \nsafe for everyone. This bill will help our State better understand and address \nwalkable  neighborhoods  and  move  toward  creating  safe  environments  for \npedestrians,  bicyclists,  motorists  and  transit  riders.  Walkable  neighborhoods \nincrease equal opportunity, promote healthier communities and can help make \nthem  safer  and  more  accessible  and  enjoyable  for  everyone.  Increasing \nwalkability can also encourage people to leave their cars behind thus reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions and pollution. \n \nMICHAEL HILLERBY (Regional Transportation Commission of Washoe County): \nWe are neutral on A.B. 343. We have not been in front of our board with the \nchanges in the proposed amendment. Much of what is envisioned in the bill \nincludes  things  the  RTC  does.  We  obviously  invest  a  lot  in  multi-modal \ntransportation, traffic safety, pedestrian and bicycle safety and making sure the \nstreets and facilities RTC has jurisdiction over meet those criteria. We work \nregularly with the organizations outlined in the bill. We appreciate the addition in \nthe amendment. Both RTCs are sizable agencies governed by elected officials in \nour respective areas and the idea of having a bill draft request available certainly \nmakes sense to us. \n \nCYRUS HOJJATY: \nI am neutral on A.B. 343. I like this bill and echo the remarks of the previous \ncallers. I would like the bill to address crosswalks that are paved rather than \nasphalt, so people can see them when they drive due to the paint on the streets \nfading away, especially in Las Vegas. I think raised crosswalks are a better \nalternative than stop signs. Roundabouts, particularly turbo roundabouts like in \nEurope, move car traffic and pedestrian flow more effectively. There a lot of \nthings missing in the bill; however, pedestrian safety is a very important issue. \nA lot of people cannot afford cars. The roads we design, especially the major \narterial roads, need serious reform. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 11, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will now close the hearing on A.B. 343.

(BDR 40-1107) \n \nHEATHER KORBULIC (Policy Director, Office of the Governor): \nI am here today representing Governor Steven Sisolak as his Policy Director. \nWitnessing the Statewide collaboration in response to this historic pandemic has \nbeen  enlightening  and  inspiring.  If  not  for  the  dedication  and  sincere \ncommitment from public and private partnerships, State and local public health \nworkforces,  nurses,  doctors,  medical  teams,  hospitals,  first  responders,  the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Department of Emergency \nManagement (DEM), the Nevada National Guard, the Nevada State Public Health \nLaboratory, and so many others, we may not have been able to realize the level \nof success we can look back on with pride. \n \nOver this past year, in many ways, Nevada did what they always do. They \nshowed up for one another, and in the darkest hours, Nevada’s battle born grit \nand practiced resilience provided much needed light. \n \nCovid-19 has exposed many of our State’s strengths and weaknesses. While we \nhave demonstrated the ability to respond to a public health crisis of significant \nmagnitude,  we  have  done  it  with  a  frail,  and  in  some  cases,  nonexistent \nessential public health infrastructure. \n \nWhile we have been able to respond effectively to this prolonged crisis, we have \nexhausted nearly every aspect of the Statewide public health system. From the \nbeginning  of  the  Covid-19  impact  on  the  State,  Governor  Sisolak  has  been \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \ncommitted to examining the data and listening to scientific experts as he made \ndecisions  to  balance  the  State’s  public  health  and  economic  needs.  This \ncommitment led to impossibly hard decisions with significant consequences and \nultimately highlighted the State public health workforce needs.  \n \nPublic health touches every single thing from DHHS to DEM to the Department \nof  Motor  Vehicles.  Every  service  of  the  State  plays  a  part  in  public  health \nresponse.  \n \nIn April 2020, Governor Sisolak released a guidance called the Nevada United: \nRoadmap to Recovery plan where he outlined the State’s goals to recovery. \nOne of  those  goals  was  to  turn  this  unprecedented  challenge  into  a  rare \nopportunity  to  transform  Nevada’s  approach  to  governance,  public  health, \neducation and economic diversification.  \n \nWe have an opportunity to learn from the experience of this pandemic to build a \nplan for a public health system we need in an emergency or our day-to-day \nefforts to serve the public health needs of Nevadans. \n \nSenate Bill 424, with the proposed amendment (Exhibit O), creates a Public \nHealth  Resource  Office  in  the  Office  of  the  Governor  to  analyze  existing \ninfrastructure for meeting Nevada’s public health needs. The Office will analyze \nthe relationships between the people and entities involved in the provision of \npublic health services including local health authorities, providers of health care, \nhealthcare facilities and not-for-profit groups. \n \nThe role of the Office is to identify and make recommendations to the Governor \nand the Legislature concerning the State’s unmet needs. It will also recommend \nopportunities  to  obtain  federal  or  private  funding  to  support  public  health \nservices  and  ways  in  which  the  State  can  improve  coordination  between \nproviders of public health services and the delivery of those services. \n \nCALEB CAGE (Covid-19 Response Director, Office of the Governor): \nThe proposed amendment, Exhibit O, is relatively straightforward where the first \nversion of the bill created the Public Health Resource Office within the Division \nof Public and Behavioral Health (DPBH) of DHHS. We are proposing to move this \nto the Office of the Governor. In all versions of the bill, the purpose of the \nOffice  has  remained  the  same  ensuring  Nevada’s  overall  public  health \ninfrastructure has a strategic vision for future improvements, and to ensure best \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \npractices  and  lessons  learned  from  the  recent  global  pandemic  inform  this \nvision.  It  also  ensures  actionable  fiscal  and  policy  recommendations  are \ndeveloped  to  pursue  this  vision.  While  these  objectives  remain  the  same, \nGovernor Sisolak believes they can be better achieved by elevating this Office \ninto the Office of the Governor.  \n \nElevating the Public Health Recourse Office from the DPBH to the Office of the \nGovernor  will  have  many  benefits.  This  position  elevates  the  importance  of \npublic health and the discussion we intend to have with this agency which has \nlong  lacked  strategic  investment  and  support.  Further  comprehensive  public \nhealth is larger than one agency and this amendment, Exhibit O, will allow for a \ngovernment approach in the future with respect to day-to-day operations and \nemergency  operations  as  a  crisis  response  such  as  we  have  recently \nexperienced. \n \nWith respect to day-to-day operations, the Office can identify how all State \nagencies invest support in proven public health outcomes by ensuring it is not \nmerely the responsibility of a single division within DHHS. During emergency \noperations,  the  Office  can  identify  opportunities  to  improve  collaboration \nbetween  response  and  support  organizations  like  the  State’s  Public  Health \nPreparedness Program within the DEM. \n \nJULIA PEEK, M.H.A., C.P.M. (Deputy Administrator, Community Health Services, \nDivision  of  Public  and  Behavioral  Health,  Department  of  Health  and \nHuman Services): \nI will read from my written remarks (Exhibit P) to present S.B. 424. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe efforts of the Department of Health and Human Services have not gone \nunnoticed by the Senate Committee on Senate Health and Human Services and \nthe entire Legislature, and we are grateful for your service over the last year and \na half. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThe communities of color were hardest hit both physically and mentally. This \nappears to be a good opportunity for the BIPOC community or someone with \ncultural sensitivity to address the needs of that community. There have been \nsuicides  by  both  young  and  old  people  in  the  Black  community  during  the \npandemic. The response, in terms of how we get a handle on it, was from \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \npastors and people trained in mental and emotional health. I want to make sure \nwe are looking at this from the standpoint of diversity. There is strength in a \nteam when you have diverse voices at the table. \n \nWhat are we going to do to ensure we diversify? \n \nMS. PEEK: \nThe public health system has been looking at disparities addressing the issue, \nand  the  establishment  of  an  office  to  help  us  provide  guidance  to  all  our \nprograms. Members of our community have been consulting with the Office of \nthe Governor on a weekly basis on how we can improve. \n \nWe applied for a grant from our partners at the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (CDC). If we are awarded the grant, it will be focused on diversity \nand disparity in our rural communities. The entire award will be looking at and \nvetting people within the community and from the community to assess broad \npublic health. \n \nKnowing  our  BIPOC  communities  have  comorbidities  and,  if  infected,  would \nhave more severe cases has been one of our challenges during the pandemic. It \nwill address all issues to make a healthier person get better self-care for chronic \ndisease,  finding  preventative  services  easier  for  the  community  and  getting \ninformation to the people in the community. \n \nThrough this grant, we are looking to partner with religious institutions and \ncommunity health workers within the community to be our messengers. This \nOffice is interested in addressing the needs of our BIPOC communities. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nWill there be outreach to see if there is anyone in the BIPOC community to fill \nthis position? In BIPOC communities, the comorbidities are off the chart. I have \nstruggled this Session to ensure I have relevant bills that speak to this. It is not \na matter of if, it is a matter of when the next pandemic will occur. High blood \npressure, asthma and diabetes are a part of the systemic racism problem and \nthe CDC agrees with this. If we are not intentional about repairing this, it will \ncontinue. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nMS. KORBULIC: \nGovernor Sisolak is committed to addressing disparities and health inequities we \nhave seen amplified by this pandemic, and this Office will be committed to \naddressing those needs with person and policy. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nOn a practical level, how does the Public Health Resource Office and the Office \nof the Governor work with DHHS and DPBH? \n \nMS. KORBULIC: \nWe intend to be closely aligned with DHHS on the projects Ms. Peek outlined, \nand it has become clear to us it takes every State agency. Pushing this position \ninto the Office of the Governor allows for elevated prioritization of authority \nnecessary  to  work  with  all  agencies  and  health  authorities  getting  them  on \nboard with developing response efforts.  \n \nCONNOR CAIN (Hospital Corporation of America; Sunrise Hospital and Medical \nCenter; Sunrise Children’s Hospital; Southern Hills Hospital and Medical \nCenter, Mountain View Hospital): \nHospital  Corporation  of  America,  on  behalf  of  Sunrise,  Sunrise  Children’s, \nSouthern Hills and Mountain View Hospitals support S.B. 424. \n \nOver  the  past  year,  our  hospitals  have  cared  for  nearly  10,000  Covid-19 \npositive patients and insured Nevadans, including those in the most vulnerable \nzip codes, had access to free antibody treatments. \n \nAs part of our efforts to continue learning from the pandemic and improve our \nability  to  serve  our  community,  we  strongly  support  Governor  Sisolak, \nMs. Korbulic, Mr. Cage and Ms. Peek’s efforts in S.B. 424. \n \nAs we begin to see light at the end of the tunnel, the Public Health Resource \nOffice will play a vital role to amplify our States efforts to educate, test and \nvaccinate our residents. For the reasons Ms. Peek mentioned, the Office will \npay significant dividends far beyond the pandemic immeasurably impacting the \nlives of many Nevadans. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nBRADLEY  MAYER  (Southern  Nevada  Health  District;  Washoe  County  Health \nDistrict): \nThe  Southern  Nevada  and  Washoe  County  Health  Districts  are  enthusiastic \nabout S.B. 424 and appreciate the Office of the Governor bringing this concept \nforward. \n \nThe Covid-19 pandemic has shown us how important public health functions \nare,  not  just  to  physical  health  but  to  our  economy.  Public  health  and  its \npartners, along with a wide variety of government agencies, have risen to the \noccasion as Nevada has battled Covid-19 while carrying out other public health \nresponsibilities. \n \nNevada  ranks  near  the  bottom  on  many  foreign  public  health  measures, \nespecially  regarding  infrastructure.  According  to  America’s  health  rankings, \nNevada ranks last in most State and federal dollars dedicated to public health; \nabout  $40  per  person  less  than  the  national  average.  According  to  a \nJanuary 2020  report  released  by  Trust  for  America’s  Health,  along  with \n13 other  states  for  preparedness  to  protect  the  public’s  health  during  an \nemergency, Nevada scored 3 out of a possible 10 in measures of public health \npreparedness  for  disease,  disasters  and  bioterrorism.  Deaths  owed  to  drug \nmisuse,  alcohol,  and  suicide  outpace  the  Country.  The  rate  of  obesity  and \nrelated conditions are high. Nevada’s sexually transmitted infections rates are \nsignificantly  higher  than  national  rates,  and  we  rank  first  for  primary  and \nsecondary syphilis. We also have our challenges with mental and behavioral \nhealth which have been exacerbated by the pandemic. We rank fifty-first for \nhigher  prevalence  of  mental  illness,  lower  rates  of  access  to  care,  and \n80 percent of rural counties nationwide report not having behavioral healthcare \nworkers. \n \nThere are several bills addressing some of the issues this Session and public \nhealth is grateful for this policy. Attempting to address some of the issues in \nprevious  sessions  would  have  allocated  $5  per  capita  or  approximately \n$50 million  to  enhance  foundational  public  health  infrastructure  Statewide. \nNevada ranks fiftieth in public health funding and would have ranked no higher \nthan forty-eighth with that investment. \n \nThis  comes  down  to  a  matter  of  resources  in  having  an  office  focused  on \nworking with stakeholders to come up with solutions to strengthen our public \nhealth system above and beyond what we are doing. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nALLISON GENCO (Dignity Health - St. Rose Dominican): \nDignity Health - St. Rose Dominican supports S.B. 424. St. Rose Dominican \nworks to address public health needs by focusing on the social determinates of \nhealth and finding ways to extend services in Las Vegas. We operate wellness \ncenters located in our neighborhood hospitals that offer free or low-cost classes \nto educate people on health-related matters including information on parenting, \nbaby safety, diabetes, blood pressure and exercise.  \n \nWe agree to address public health needs, we must address the public health \ninfrastructure first and foremost. St. Rose Dominican is proud to be part of the \npublic health infrastructure in southern Nevada. We support finding innovative \nways to bolster the public health infrastructure and creating the Public Health \nResource Office will be a major step in that direction. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 424. \n \nEMILY MIMNAUGH (Pacific Justice Institute): \nI  am  an  attorney  in  Nevada  testifying  on  behalf  of  Pacific  Justice  Institute \nopposing A.B 287. This bill raises significant and fundamental concerns about \npublic and legal policy. The stated aim of the bill is furthering the welfare of \npregnant  mothers.  Unfortunately,  the  bill  strays  far  from  its  initial  purpose. \nInstead of protecting mothers, it erases any reference to them 40 times over. \nThe bill seeks the redefinition of a parent-child relationship by eliminating the \nterms mother and father throughout the law.  \n \nThese changes are deeply problematic as a matter of public policy and as a \nmatter of law. As a matter of public policy, the stated purpose of the bill bears \nno relation to this “terminology revision”. Simultaneously, it denies the relation \nof a mother and father to their child. As a matter of law, the denial of a “mother \nand father” is inconsistent with the entirety of the Nevada Revised Statutes \n(NRS) which is replete with references to a mother and father. This creates \nconfusion and inconsistency. \n \nAssembly Bill 287 does not follow the fundamentals of logic and deletes any \nreference  to  a  “mother.”  To  achieve  this,  it  is  performing  busying,  if  not \ntongue-tying verbal gymnastics to offer four different vocabulary options “as \nappropriate”. The bill provides for new terms so a mother can now only be \ncalled either a person who is pregnant, a person giving birth, a person who gave \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nbirth or a person who has given birth as appropriate. The bill transforms the \nfather into “other parent.” The bill erases a child’s mother from existence; she \ncan never be a mother.  \n \nLegally,  NRS  does  not  reduce  a  mother  only  to  her  status  of  pregnant  or \nbirthing. If the goal is to rewrite the entirety of the NRS with these ill-conceived \nand radical revisions, this goal is over reaching and impractical. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRemainder of page intentionally left blank; signature page to follow.   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSeeing no further public comment, the meeting is adjourned at 4:31 p.m. \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nVickie Polzien, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nExhibit  Begins \nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \nLetter  on Page \nAgenda \n  A  1   \nWork Session Document \nA.B. 438  B  1  Megan Comlossy \nWork Session Document \nA.B. 178  C  1  Megan Comlossy \nWork Session Document \nA.B. 197  D  1  Megan Comlossy \nWork Session Document \nA.B. 205  E  1  Megan Comlossy \nWork Session Document \nA.B. 228  F  1  Megan Comlossy \nWork Session Document \nA.B. 278  G  1  Megan Comlossy \nWork Session Document \nA.B. 287  H  1  Megan Comlossy \nWork Session Document \nA.B. 326  I  1  Megan Comlossy \nWork Session Document \nA.B. 343  J  1  Megan Comlossy \nWork Session Document \nA.B. 344  K  1  Megan Comlossy \nWork Session Document \nA.B. 345  L  1  Megan Comlossy \nWork Session Document \nA.B. 374  M  1  Megan Comlossy \nWork Session Document \nA.B. 430  N  1  Megan Comlossy \n \nHeather Korbulic /  Proposed Amendment \nS.B. 424  O  1 \nOffice of the Governor \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nJulia Peek / Department \nWritten Testimony \nS.B. 424  P  1  of Health and Human \nServices \n ", "43": "\nMINUTES OF THE  \nSENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n \nEighty-first Session \nMay 18, 2021 \n \n \nThe Senate Committee on Health and Human Services was called to order by \nChair  Julia  Ratti  at  5:47  p.m.  on  Tuesday,  May  18,  2021,  Online  and  in \nRoom 2134 of the Legislative Building, Carson City, Nevada.

(Senior Advisor on Behavioral Health, Division of \nPublic and Behavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services): \nIn addition, I will also briefly outline the two tables (Exhibit C and Exhibit D) \nrelating to behavioral health and what this bill is intending to do. Senate Bill 390 \nmakes two key changes relating to behavioral health. The  first requires the \nDivision of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human \nServices (DHHS) to establish a hotline—which may be accessed by dialing 9-8-8 \nfor people who are considering suicide or are in a behavioral health crisis—and \nto  create  at  least  one  support  center  to  answer  calls  and  coordinate  the \nresponse to those calls. \n \nThe second part of the bill creates the Nevada Fund for Healthy Communities to \nhold  the  proceeds  of  litigation  by  the  State  concerning  the  manufacture, \ndistribution, sale and marketing of opioids. The bill will also provide for the \ndistribution  of  that  money  as  grants  to  State,  regional,  local  and  tribal \ngovernments and nonprofit organizations for projects that address the impacts \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 18, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nof opioid use disorder and other substance use disorders. It requires the DHHS \nto conduct a needs assessment to determine priorities for allocating money from \nthe Fund and to distribute the grants. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nA  few  of  the  items  Dr.  Woodard  has  outlined  are  different  than  what  was \npresented to the Senate Committee on Finance last week. I want to highlight a \ncouple of those points as we are working with the telecommunications industry \nthat is going to collect a lot of this revenue.  \n \nSection  3,  subsection  3  of  Proposed  Amendment  3328  provides  liability \nprotection for telecommunication providers which is something they requested. \nSection 5, subsection 1 of the amendment states \"the amount of the surcharge \nmust not exceed 50 cents for each access line or trunk line.\" I suggest an \namendment  to  cap  the  amount  at  35  cents  knowing  that  would  provide  a \nsufficient revenue match through available federal dollars to address the goals \nand  objectives  of  the  account.  Additionally,  this  provides  the  regulatory \noversight for creating that surcharge to the State Board of Health rather than \nthe Public Utilities Commission of Nevada and then have to go through the usual \nAdministrative Procedures Act to walk through the regulatory process of the \nState Board of Health.  \n \nSection 5, subsection 2, paragraph (b) of the amendment states that any funds \ngenerated by this new surcharge cannot be used to supplant existing funding \nthat currently is used for those behavioral health services. These are the primary \ndifferences between what was presented to the Senate Committee on Finance \nin this section of the bill and what you see in Proposed Amendment 3328. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe are in agreement with all of those changes, which are considered friendly \nchanges  to  the  bill.  Dr.  Woodard,  please  move  on  to  the  opioid  settlement \nportion of the bill. \n \nDR. WOODARD: \nI  will  briefly  address  the  S.B.  390  Fund  for  a  Resilient  Nevada–Opioid \nSettlement/Litigation Funding Exhibit D, specifically sections 7 through 9.5. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 18, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe learned how specifically targeted the opioid settlement dollars are to the \nStatewide impact of the opioid epidemic. A lot of the work was reframing the \nwhole process to a Statewide response, which includes the needs assessment, \nplan and distribution process. I want to thank Senator Kieckhefer for helping \nwith the amendments that would make sure the Legislature has a significant \nrole in approving it during the Legislative Session every biennium and through \nthe Interim Finance Committee process. Based on some of the comments from \nthe Committee members, we made sure there are multiple places in the bill that \nnow look at the disparate impact on certain communities, and we are doing \noutreach to lots of individuals who we may not get to otherwise. Those are the \nbig significant changes we made. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe intent coming out of the Senate Committee on Finance was to ensure that \nthe account set up pursuant to this act would be an Executive Budget account, \nand  we  would  budget  these  funds  similar  to  the  method  we  used  for  the \nHealthy Nevada Fund so that DHHS will come up with an expenditure plan to be \nincorporated into the agency’s budget proposal. We would move forward that \nway  and  make  adjustments  as  necessary  if  additional  settlements  come  in \nduring the Interim, potentially through the Interim Finance Committee process. I \nwould like to move forward with the amendment today. What we have before \nus reinserts the role of the Legislature in the process and ensures that it moves \ninto an Executive Budget account rather than a nonexecutive account. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThis bill has been on a journey, and it has gotten to a good place. It has a \nstrong problematic side where we are making sure the settlement always gets \nused to address the impact of the opioid epidemic, as well as ensuring there is a \ngood  focus  on  disparate  communities.  At  the  same  time,  it  is  doing  the \nimportant  work  that  Senator  Kieckhefer  has  identified  in  making  sure  the \nLegislature retains its ability to direct these funds in the future. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThis bill is quite encouraging because this is a major step for us moving in the \ndirection of bringing equity to the communities that have been hurt so badly by \nthe opioid pandemic. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 18, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI received the two handouts that are impressive with the work that went into \nthem. Regarding the Fund for a Resilient Nevada, no State money is going to \nthis unless it is for the needs assessment that must be done.  Is this Fund \ncompletely separate and distinct from any State money and therefore does not \nhave a two-thirds requirement to increase a fee or tax? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe Fund for a Resilient Nevada is a bucket that catches all of the settlement \ndollars into an Executive Budget account so they can be appropriately handled. \nThere  would  be  no  effect  on  the  General  Fund.  The  bill  does  contemplate \n8 percent of allowed administrative costs so the work can be implemented, but \nthe majority of it gets out and makes a difference. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI was correct in that assumption. Regarding the Crisis Response Account, has \nthe State Board of Health ever adopted regulations determining the amount of a \nsurcharge, or is that a new concept we are looking at? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIn that fund, the surcharge is to stand up the 9-8-8 hotline, and the 35 cents \nper line goes into the fund. The amendment puts a cap up to 35 cents. The \nregulatory process will determine what the actual need is, but it can go no \nhigher than 35 cents. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe regulatory board decides something that usually is a legislative decision \nabout how much of a fee to charge. I do not know of anybody who gets to \ndetermine their own fee without legislative oversight. \n \nERIC ROBBINS (Counsel): \nIt is common where the Legislature sets the maximum amount of a fee. The \nboards can prescribe less than that fee if they want, which is common for \nprofessional licensing boards that operate that way. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIs that the one that puts this bill at a two-thirds majority vote? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 18, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThat  is  correct.  The  two-thirds  on  this  particular  bill  comes  from  the \nimplementation of the new surcharge fee on the phone lines. \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nI would also like to point out for the licensure of medical facilities, Nevada \nRevised Statutes 449.050 lets the State Board of Health set application fees at \nan amount determined by regulation of the Board. In that case, the State Board \nof Health does determine the licensing fees. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe  reason  is  that  we  have  a  9-8-8  planning  grant  underway  at  this  time. \nThrough the process of that 9-8-8 planning grant, we are assessing the need, \nwhich will determine what the appropriate budget needs are to set that fee. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nA lot of work went into this, and I am impressed. One of the challenges I have \nis where this is all going to fit at the end and how we are going to afford it. I \nwill be voting no, but I am impressed and willing to consider changing my vote \nlater if it all fits together. \n \nSENATOR  HARRIS  MOVED  TO  AMEND  AND  DO  PASS  AS  AMENDED \nS.B. 390. \n \n  SENATOR SPEARMAN SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe  motion  includes  a  deviation  from  Proposed  Amendment  3328  from \n50 cents to 35 cents. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThank you for the clarification. It would include lowering the cap to 35 cents. \n \n  THE MOTION CARRIED. (SENATOR HARDY VOTED NO.) \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will now open the hearing on Assembly Bill (A.B.) 348. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 18, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 348 (1st Reprint): Revises provisions relating to the Patient \nProtection Commission. (BDR 40-497) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN MAGGIE CARLTON (Assembly District No. 14): \nI am presenting A.B. 348 which will make changes to the provisions governing \nthe Patient Protection Commission. The bill went through a large rewrite in the \nAssembly,  and  we  are  now  working  from  the  first  reprint.  During  the \n2019 Legislative Session, Governor Steve Sisolak proposed and the Legislature \npassed  S.B.  No.  544  of  the  80th  Session,  creating  the  Patient  Protection \nCommission,  an  independent  body  tasked  with  reviewing  issues  related  to \nNevadans’ healthcare needs, as well as healthcare accessibility, affordability and \nquality.  However,  as  we  all  know,  legislation  is  iterative,  and  after  the \nCommission got up and running, we recognized the need to make adjustments \nto it. I want to thank Dr. Ikram Kahn and Sara Cholhagian for their hard work \nthroughout the process. \n \nThe goals of A.B. 348 are to move the Commission from the Office of the \nGovernor to DHHS, revise Commission membership, ensure members are held \naccountable,  address  issues  related  to  conflicts  of  interest  and  give  the \nCommission tools to operate more effectively. The concerns I heard today are \nthat folks want to see more people come onto the Commission and not be \nreplaced. The proposal in this bill is to replace some members. It is to get this \nCommission to the point where we are talking about having real data, quality, \naccessibility and affordability of health care. \n \nThe 11 members of the Commission at this time can be viewed as industry \nstakeholders in a number of ways. Partway through the work the Commission \nwas doing, I started to hear concerns about conflict issues. You will see in this \nbill that we added standard language of disclosure and conflict so everyone \nknows who they are representing. That is how we addressed that particular \nissue. These changes in membership will make a significant difference in the \nwork this Commission will be able to do in the future to get good, hard data. \n \nAs long as I have been in this building, unfortunately, we have had to make a \nlot of decisions based on health care with anecdotal data. We can now start \nmaking real decisions. As you go through the memberships, you will see a lot of \nit  switched  over  to  a  more  nonprofit  world  than  the  for-profit  world.  Just \nbecause you are nonprofit does not mean you do not have a budget you have to \nbalance and you do not have to be accountable for the dollars. It means there is \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 18, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \na  different  attitude  toward  it.  We  tried  to  incorporate  some  of  the  existing \nmemberships and change others to represent a broader base of who would be \nthe best voice for patients in the future. \n \nThis  Commission  will  have  sole  authority  over  the  Milbank  Memorial  Fund \nProgram that the Patient Protection Commission will be able to work on and \nthat aims at sustainable healthcare costs. This will be a lot of work for the \nCommission to get done over this biennium. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThank you for acknowledging that this bill had the all-payer claims database and \nfor working with the Executive Director of the Patient Protection Commission \nearly in the Session to make sure that we did not have multiple vehicles and \nconflicting work going on. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe  sponsor  already  alluded  to  my  questions.  If  we  concentrate  on  the \nnonprofits, we are not getting half or more of the care provided by hospitals, \nhealth insurers, academic institutions or the pharmaceutical industry. That is my \nconcern with the bill. We do need the data, and it is a one-armed input. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nMy question is related to the health information exchange language in section 3, \nsubsection 1, paragraph (c). We have the Statewide-designated Nevada Health \nInformation Exchange which is working to continue to expand its network of \nproviders and facilities that are coordinating the exchange of health information. \nI am trying to understand what we are getting at in this part of the bill. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN CARLTON: \nIt is to allow the Commission to have jurisdiction over that particular area and to \nmake sure the interoperability of that works and the data is updated. It is also to \nmake sure the data is shared and comes back to the Legislature for future \nconversations. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nCan  you  please  tell  me  what  the  Peterson-Milbank  Program  for  Sustainable \nHealth Care Costs is? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 18, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN CARLTON: \nIt is a grant that the Patient Protection Commission, through the leadership of \nits director, received, and the Commission will enable to work further to address \nhealthcare costs in this State. Some of the things we have talked about in the \npast have been cost-to-charge ratio versus billable costs versus network costs, \nout-of-network costs and looking at all the different costs across the State. \nWhen you look at that and the makeup of the Commission—this is in no way \nmeant to be insulting to any of the members that were on the Commission—we \nhave to understand that this current Commission has a true industry flavor to it. \nIf we are going to have honest, objective conversations, the industry needs to \nstep back and let other people come forward and have those real conversations. \nThis does not say that the industry cannot participate; they just will not be \nvoting members. When we get into real discussions about healthcare costs in \nthe future, we need to make sure we have people on this Commission who do \nnot have the inherent conflict of providing data and talking about costs when \ntheir job is to be part of this Commission but they are being paid by an industry.  \n \nI am trying to be as polite about this as possible because I understand everyone \nhas a job to do. I represent a group of people, so do each of you Senators, but \nwe all have to make sure we put the right people on these Commissions who \nwill make the good decisions for Nevada and not for their industry. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe  Peterson-Milbank  Grant  is  a  wonderful  grant.  We  need  to  give \nSara Cholhagian two minutes to talk about it because it is something the world \nshould know about. \n \nSARA CHOLHAGIAN (Executive Director, Patient Protection Commission): \nIt  was  announced  on  March  9  that  Nevada  joined  four  other  states, \nConnecticut, Oregon, New Jersey and Washington, to be part of a program that \nimplements  spending  targets  to  make  health  care  more  transparent  and \naffordable.  With  Nevada's  participation  in  this  program,  we  are  receiving \ntechnical  assistance  from  Bailet  Health,  which  is  helping  Nevada  set  and \nimplement healthcare cost growth targets. These targets are a first step toward \nmaking health care more affordable and transparent. The goals of this project \nare to focus on the underlying causes of rising healthcare costs and to develop \nthe capacity to track and benchmark healthcare spending across payers at the \nState level.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 18, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nIn addition, the project will analyze spending data in an effort to pinpoint cost \ndrivers and inform interventions. This is an exciting time for Nevada to have this \nmultistate collaborative effort. It is a two-year program that helps our State \nlaunch into establishing a benchmark and looking at healthcare spending in a \ndata-driven way. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nCongratulations for leading that effort. Is there a requirement that we need to \ndesignate a lead agency as part of that participation? \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nNo, there is no program requirement to designate any sole agency. Rather, there \nis  a  requirement  that  the  Governor  designate  a  State  lead  to  manage  the \nparticipation of this program. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThis is exciting. Washington State has been doing this program since 2014. It \nwas introduced by Senator Randi Becker and passed on bipartisan lines because \nthis is important information. It will put more power in the hands of consumers \nbecause they will be able to see exactly what is going on. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIs the Veterans Health Administration (VA) Hospital going to be involved with \nthis?  Sunrise  Hospital  is  for  profit,  but  the  VA  Hospital  is  not.  I  do  have \nmisgivings about the one-armed approach, but are we going to involve the VA \nsystem? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAssemblywoman  Carlton,  would  the  VA  Hospital  qualify  for  the  nonprofit \nhospital seat if that was who the Governor wanted? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN CARLTON: \nThe VA is under federal jurisdiction, and I would not want to speak for the \nfederal government. I am not sure, but there is nothing that would prohibit the \nVA from participating as far as public members being involved in the meetings \nand providing input. As for how the VA is classified, I am not aware of that. It \nis purely federal jurisdiction, and I am unsure of what opportunities there would \nbe.  Nothing  in  this  bill  would  prohibit  the  VA  from  being  a  part  of  the \nconversations in public meetings. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 18, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nIt would qualify if it is a nonprofit hospital. A federal hospital would qualify if it \nwas chosen, if it met the other criteria, and if it wants to participate. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN CARLTON: \nThat is great knowledge. As this bill moves forward, the Governor needs to \nknow this so that as he chooses representation, he can reach out to someone at \nthe  VA  and  tell  them  there  may  possibly  be  an  opportunity  for  the  VA  to \nparticipate. These members will all still be chosen by the Governor. That would \nbe  an  excellent  conversation  point  to  have  with  the  Governor  as  we  move \nforward. \n \nSTACIE SASSO (Health Services Coalition): \nWe  support  A.B.  348.  When  the  Governor  formed  the  Patient  Protection \nCommission, it was with the intention of protecting the patient with price focus \nbeing one of those topics. In order for the Commission to be effective, we need \nto ensure patient voices are front and center of the Commission, not just have \nthe  industry  perspective  when  healthcare  policy  recommendations  are  being \nshaped.  The  Commission's  main  mission  should  be  to  examine  healthcare \naccess, quality and affordability in the State and make policy recommendations \nto continue to improve a well-healthcare system for patients in Nevada. \n \nRUSTY MCALLISTER (Nevada State AFL-CIO): \nWe support A.B. 348. This is a good policy and provides information to the \npeople that utilize health services. This will provide more of a perspective from \nthe people who utilize the health services as opposed to those who are running \nthe  hospital  industry  or  the  medical  industry.  Most  of  all,  this  will  provide \ninformation for patients and is a good way for them to be represented. \n \nMAYA HOLMES (Culinary Workers Union Local 226 Health Fund): \nWe support A.B. 348. Governor Sisolak's 2019 decision in the Legislature to \ncreate the Patient Protection Commission was an essential step to improve the \nhealthcare  system  for  all  Nevadans.  The  Commission's  primary  goal  is  to \nexamine and propose solutions to address access, quality and affordability in \nour healthcare system. There is no question Nevadans need and deserve access \nto high quality, affordable health care. Unfortunately, ensuring the Commission \nis getting direct patients' perspectives and experiences has been a challenge. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 18, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nWe want the Commission to be a voice for patients, which can then be the \nbackbone  in  developing  effective  policy  solutions.  The  inclusion  of  more \nmembers with the history of advocating on behalf of insured and uninsured \npatients and working in the nonprofit sector is simply essential. The new voices \nwill bring specific and much-needed, patient-centered expertise crucial to the \nCommission's work. The intent of this bill is to maintain a Commission whose \nsize does not become unwieldy but still expands the breadth of expertise to \nensure a greater focus on and broader range of patient experiences are balanced \nwith the industry perspectives and interests. We support the effort to address \nany conflicts of interest, adopt needed bylaws and place the Commission within \nthe DHHS. This will ensure it has additional tools and the structure it needs to \nachieve its goals. \n \nJAMES WADHAMS (Nevada Hospital Association): \nWe are neutral on A.B. 348. We have no opposition to expanding to additional \nmembership  on  the  Patient  Protection  Commission.  Additional  perspective  is \nespecially helpful. This Commission had a difficult start because the board was \nnot  fully  appointed  until  approximately  January  and,  unfortunately,  within \n30 days after its first meeting, the Covid-19 crisis hit and constrained some of \nthe activity. Ultimately, the Senate Committee on Health and Human Services \nproduced two bills that are moving well through this process. The first is S.B. 5, \ndealing with telemedicine, and it has proven to be a significant opportunity to \nensure people in a lockdown period still have access to care. The second is \nS.B. 40, which addresses the all-payer claims database, and that seems to be \nmoving through the process. \n \nSENATE BILL 5 (2nd Reprint): Makes changes relating to telehealth. (BDR 40-\n416) \n \nSENATE BILL 40 (1st Reprint): Provides for the collection of certain data relating \nto health care. (BDR 40-415) \n \nOur concern is eliminating one of the positions representing hospitals; there are \ntwo  in  the  bill  and  on  the  current  Commission.  Eliminating  that  upon  the \nexpiration  of  either  one  of  those  terms  is  problematic.  Nevada  has  over \n35 short-term  acute  care  hospitals  spread  over  northern,  southern  and  rural \nNevada. There are county, district, nonprofit and for-profit hospitals. There may \nbe an opportunity for a federal hospital as well. Under the mix of our short-term \nhospitals, 92 percent of the patient days are accessed in private hospitals. In \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 18, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \norder to fully evaluate costs, the information on the cost drivers of the delivery \nof that service is critical. The voices and costs of that care should be available \nto a broader, expanded Commission so the perspective of the delivery of care \ncan be blended into the consideration of the costs and use of care. \n \nThe Governor created the Commission with the help of the Legislature in 2019, \nand he took care to identify the positions that should be part of the balance of \nthat body and specifically have the authority to identify those individuals. During \nthe Covid-19 emergency, the Governor focused his Task Force for COVID-19 \nMitigation  and  Management  on  maintaining  hospital  capacity  and  issued  a \ndeclaration to the Commission to particularly learn the lessons that would be \nexperienced during the Covid-19 crisis. Hospitals were asked to expand capacity \ndramatically to accommodate patient admissions which, at one point, were over \n2,000 per day. The perspective that comes from the variety and differentiation \nof the various hospitals is going to be critical, even for an expanded Protection \nCommission. We have no concerns about the expansion of that Commission, \nbut we would request that the Committee consider reinstating at least one more \nhospital to provide the diversity of that perspective and the cost drivers that go \nwith that. \n \nGEORGE ROSS (Hospital Corporation of America): \nWe  are  neutral  on  A.B.  348.  We  echo  the  words  of  Mr.  Wadhams.  We \ncompletely agree with the objectives stated by the sponsor of this bill: \"quality, \naccess and affordability.\" The key is that 92 percent of the patient beds are in \nthe private sector. This State has for the last 50 to 60 years relied upon the \nprivate sector to keep up the amount and the investments in health care that \nthis State needs to keep up with its growing population. Similarly, virtually all \nthe investments are in the private sector in terms of new quality, both in terms \nof how you practice it, how you apply it and how you bring in new features and \ntreatments. This all comes through the private sector. It is imperative, if we are \ntalking about access and quality, that we take their needs into account. You \ncannot take them for granted.  \n \nFinally, affordability is an area of cost and especially when the Commission has \njust begun the Peterson-Milbank work. You need people on that Commission \nwho understand the practical side of health care and costs. We strongly urge \nyou to add back a hospital member in addition to what is in the bill and make it \njust  a  plain  hospital  member  and  not  specifically  say  nonprofit  because  the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 18, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nprivate  sector  provides  so  much  of  the  health  care  in  this  State.  That \nperspective and knowledge are needed. \n \nROCKY FINSETH (PhRMA): \nWe are neutral on A.B. 348. We support Governor Sisolak's efforts at creating \nthe  Commission.  As  previously  mentioned,  we  request  insertion  of  the \npharmaceutical  representative  back  in  the  Commission.  We  support  the \nexpansion of the body. We have submitted our proposed amendment (Exhibit E). \n \nJARON HILDEBRAND (Nevada State Medical Association): \nWe are neutral on A.B. 348. We echo the comments of the former testifiers. \nWe would like to see our seat remain on the Commission. We do not agree with \nthe  initiatives  Assemblywoman  Carlton  is  putting  before  us.  With  our \n2,000 physician members and their unique patient mix, I feel we also would \nbring value to the Commission, in addition to a federally qualified healthcare \nphysician,  and  bring  other  perspectives  throughout  the  State  and  a  broad \nspectrum of healthcare policies.  \n \nDORA MARTINEZ (Nevada Disability Peer Action Coalition): \nWe support A.B. 348. We ditto the remarks previously made by the supporting \ntestifiers.  \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN CARLTON: \nI found the neutral testimony quite unique. I did not get this neutral testimony in \nthe Assembly. There was one person with the health plans that did testify in \nneutral. I heard from PhRMA today in the hallway, and Mr. Ross shared his \nconcerns by text with me late this morning. You see the bill right now in a good \nposition. I did amend the bill in the Assembly. Assemblywoman Robin L. Titus \nbrought up a valid concern, and we did amend it, but the bill still did not get her \nvote. I am finished amending the bill. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe will now close the hearing on A.B. 348. We have reached the point in the \nSession where it is important that we move things along relatively quickly, so it \nis my intention to have a work session for the bill today.  \n \nI have been relatively involved with the Patient Protection Commission since it \nwas first created. The Commission bill originated in the Senate last Session, and \nI worked closely at that time with Alison Combs to figure out what might work. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 18, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nThe model was to throw stakeholders, who are not always on the same page, in \na room for a while and see if we could come up with solutions where everyone \nhad  significant  buy-in.  Both  of  the  bills  that  came  out  of  the  Commission \noriginated in the Senate this time, and I probably have spent more time working \non the Commission bills in this Legislative Session than I have combined on all \nof my own personal bills. I am not sure it is working. A lot of people put in a lot \nof hard work to try and make it work. I am not casting any aspersions. There \nhave been good and sincere efforts.  \n \nI thank Ms. Cholhagian for the significant time, energy and work she has put in. \nShe has done an excellent job as the Executive Director. I am okay with trying \nsomething new to get more of the patient advocate voice involved. I may have \na bias coming from the nonprofit sector.  \n \nNonprofit and for-profit hospitals have far more in common. A small business \nand  small  nonprofit  have  more  in  common,  and  a  large  business  and  large \nnonprofit have more in common. The nonprofit hospitals are dealing with all the \nsame cost management and insurance. The only thing they are not dealing with \nis trying to pay attention to the profits for the shareholders. That is my personal \nopinion. I am ready to support this and try something new.  \n \nI have been relatively engaged in this process and have tried to be a good \nneutral player to continue to move things along, but I hope that whether you \nhave a seat on the board or not, everyone stays engaged and we continue to \nfigure out how to work together as people who care about advancing health \ncare. I will be supporting this bill in its current form. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nI appreciate Assemblywoman Carlton's policy take on the changes she wants to \nmake. Taking out the voice of some of the most significant payers within the \nhealthcare system is a problem as well as some of the significant cost drivers. \nThis is more of a philosophical difference, so for now I will be voting no. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWe are not doing ourselves a service to have diversity in the representation and \nmore than just one diversity. I would look forward to these meetings to see how \nthis particular body can increase the number of physicians we have in the State \nof  Nevada.  This  is  a  glaring  problem,  and  we  hope  this  particular  body \naddresses that. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 18, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \n  SENATOR SPEARMAN MOVED TO DO PASS A.B. 348. \n \n  SENATOR HARRIS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED.

(BDR 38-193) \n \nSENATOR JAMES A. SETTELMEYER (Senatorial District No. 17): \nSenate Bill No. 446 of the 80th Session was brought before us and passed out \nof committee but lost on the Senate Floor. This bill has two aspects. One is the \nconcept of self-managed care, the other will be presented by Senator Hardy, \ndealing with Medicaid termination for those incarcerated. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 16, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nThis bill came about as I saw my friend Ted Nagel on the street, at night, in his \nwheelchair headed for the hospital. As I spoke with him, I found out he was \nunable to find individuals to care for him at his home at the rate made available \nto them. This bill would allow Mr. Nagel to be in charge of his own care, called \nself-managed care, as he has the wherewithal to do this. Self-managed care is \nnot for everyone but for those who have the mental faculties to manage their \nown care, giving them the opportunity to have those resources available at a \nhigher level. \n \nThis would give those individuals making $10 an hour the ability to make up to \nthe  federal  rate  offering  which  is  $25  to  $27.  The  personal  managed  care \nconcept, after being reduced as it is within federal law, would give them the \nability  to  be  paid,  perhaps,  $17  to  $21.  With  that  wage,  you  could  find \nindividuals in today’s market willing to work, doing what is necessary to care \nfor our disabled. \n \nTED NAGEL: \nI support S.B. 93. This bill is important to my physical well-being and human \nright to earn a living and enjoy life. During the last campaign cycle, many of the \ncandidates  across  the  levels  of  government  made  points  about  the  Nation \ngreatly lacking in personal caregivers. Several referred to it as a pandemic unto \nitself, most attributing it to low wages.  \n \nI was born with a physical disability called Arthrogryposis. Although I am not \nparalyzed  and  have  full  feeling,  my  physical  abilities  fit  the  description  of \nsomeone who is paralyzed. I rely on the assistance of others to help me out of \nbed, bathe, groom, prepare meals, etc. Without any or all of these basic needs \ntaken care of, I would remain in bed unable to do anything for myself.  \n \nWith these needs met, I am able to function in society and operate my own \nbusiness as a mobile DJ, entertaining for events such as weddings and funerals. \nI do marketing for several business which, until the pandemic, kept me busy. As \nI live in a rural area, it has been difficult to find caregivers willing to work for the \nmeager  pay  offered  through  the  Medicaid-funded  personal  care  program.  At \nbest, they would earn $10.50 an hour. For that amount of money, most people \nwould rather work at a fast-food establishment than take care of someone’s \npersonal hygiene. The few caregivers who do it well do not last working for \nagencies making this wage when they could be making $20 to $25 an hour \nworking under a private pay situation. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 16, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nDue to my wife’s own physical limitations, she is unable to provide the care I \nrequire. It became the practice of one care agency after another, as she lives in \nthe home, to not send anyone out to provide care any time the agency had a \nscheduling issue. As a result, on June 3, 2018, I resigned myself to check into \na long-term care facility until the issue was resolved. I expected this to be one, \nmaybe two months. Two months turned into 4 months, then a year, and to my \ndispleasure, I remained in the facility for 30 months.  \n \nI returned home on December 3, 2020, as the coronavirus hit the facility and \nten residents were diagnosed in one week with Covid-19. We were afraid I \nwould catch the virus and pass away. Until I can get back on the Medicaid \nprogram that once again will provide a caregiver, I am living at home under the \ncare of my wife who still has her physical limitations to deal with.  \n \nTo  make  things  work,  I  stay  in  bed  every  other  day  to  allow  my  wife  to \nrecuperate from helping me the day before. This is not a pleasant arrangement \nfor either of us, but one that is necessary. This situation is not conducive to me \nreturning to work, so we live solely on my monthly social security disability \npayments. It is interesting that spouses, or other immediate family members \nliving  in  the  home  providing  care,  cannot  be  reimbursed  through  Medicaid. \nThese family members may have given up their careers in order to take care of \ntheir family member.  \n \nI  want  you  to  understand  there  are  several  thousand  disabled  residents  in \nNevada with similar stories of difficulty finding caregivers due to low wages and \nlack of caregivers due to that low wage. As a member of the Nevada Disability \nPrevention  Action  Coalition,  I  want  to  represent  those  who,  in  the  past  or \ncurrently, suffer from lack of care.  \n \nSenate Bill 93, in part, provides an avenue for Nevada residents who have the \ncognitive ability to manage their own finances, to pay a reasonable salary from \nthe State directly to caregivers for their services up to the federally mandated \nmaximum. Until now, no one was able to subsidize their caregivers pay to make \nthe job more palatable and keep reasonable caregivers employed without getting \nkicked off of the program. We need to move forward to a society that opens as \nmany  opportunities  for  independence  as  possible.  It  took  many  years  for \ndisabled folks to “come out of the disability closet.” Many are trying to hold \ndown a job and rely on caregivers to make it out their front door to go to work. \nLet us make that situation one less thing for them to worry about. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 16, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nSENATOR SETTELMEYER: \nThe first section of S.B. 93 represents self-managed care. An individual such as \nMr. Nagel contacts an agency that takes a portion of the fund, and hires a \ncaregiver, which reduces the funds available for the caregiver to $10 to $12 an \nhour.  Sadly,  for  the  type  of  personal  care  Mr.  Nagel  and  most  individuals \nrequire, there are not many willing to work for that wage. \n \nThere have been discussions on what a minimum wage should be. Paying below \nthat number for these types of services makes it difficult to find caregivers. This \nwould allow Mr. Nagel to handle his own self-managed care and be reimbursed \nup to the federal fund amount to hire a caregiver. He would, in essence, become \nthat person hired through the agency. This is not for everyone. There are those \nwho do not have the wherewithal to do this such as Mr. Nagel does. Those that \ndo should be given the opportunity to manage their own personal care and hire \nassistance  accordingly,  using  up  to  the  federal  amount  allowed  to  pay \ncaregivers.  \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThis would allow an individual to supplement the caregiver’s wages with his or \nher own resources? \n \nSENATOR SETTELMEYER: \nIt would allow individuals, such as Mr. Nagel, to hire a caregiver and pay $50 an \nhour if they have the resources to afford the difference between their income \nand the federal rate. Right now, they are forbidden by law from paying anything \nover the federal rate. This bill would allow them the opportunity to hire someone \nat a higher rate and make up the difference themselves. \n \nSENATOR JOSEPH P. HARDY (Senatorial District No. 12): \nSection 3 of S.B. 93 represents Medicaid being terminated when an individual is \nincarcerated. If it were to be suspended, it would be easier for the individual to \nget  back  on  track  rather  than  if  it  were  terminated.  When  an  individual  is \nincarcerated, he or she loses Medicaid coverage because the State assumes \ncharge of the care of the individual, paying for medical services. Tradition is that \nunless there is a waiver, the State terminates Medicaid and the individual has to \nreapply when released from prison.  \n \nOne of the consistencies we find is it takes longer to have a new application for \nMedicaid  completed  than  to  reinstate  if  it  has  been  suspended.  When  an \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 16, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nindividual is released, that person is vulnerable, has medical issues, substance \nuse disorders, a longer wait to get approval for Medicaid to be reinstated and is \nat risk for recidivism. \n \nSection 3 of S.B. 93 allows the State to suspend Medicaid, thus reinstating it in \neffectiveness immediately upon release from prison. It is good for the prisoner \nand good for the State as we save money. It helps with the challenges of \nrecidivism, getting individuals safely back into society receiving the care they \nneed while eligible for Medicaid. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe Division of Welfare and Supportive Services has a pilot program running in \nour State correctional facilities to ensure individuals are enrolled in Medicaid \neffective  upon  release  from  prison.  What  is  the  state  of  play  for  when \nindividuals are in county jails awaiting adjudication? Are they in the same status \nas State inmates at this point, and would this bill also capture them? \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWhen in a halfway house, this waiver would be effective, so you would be \neligible for Medicaid; however, I will defer to the experts to confirm this. \n \nLISA  SWEARINGEN  (Chief,  Eligibility  and  Payments,  Division  of  Welfare  and \nSupportive Services, Department of Health and Human Services): \nWe are running a pilot project with a couple of institutions in Las Vegas. We are \nworking with enrolling these individuals as part of their prerelease package. We \nhelp the inmate fill out the application to assume a suspend status so we are \nnotified as soon as he or she is released and their cases made eligible. That \nprocess takes from 24 to 48 hours to complete as we have to run through a \nbatch process to the Medicaid agency. The inmate receives a Medicaid card \nupon release.  \n \nWe do not have anything in place at this time in the county jails for suspending \nthese individuals. We are looking at detention centers and recently signed a \ncontract with the Public Consulting Group to obtain incarceration information to \nget a better idea on when individuals become incarcerated so we can quickly \nget them benefits once they are released.  \n \nWe have a process in place with the Department of Corrections for applications \nsubmitted when individuals are incarcerated and leave the facility to go into the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 16, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nhospital. If they are in the hospital over 24 hours, we are able to take those bills \nand process them as a prior medical request, paying those bills under Medicaid. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe ability to create a suspended status would affect any Medicaid recipient, \nregardless of which level of custody in county jail or State custody? \n \nMS. SWEARINGEN: \nWe built a process in our system to suspend these individuals. It shows they are \nsuspended; however, it sends the ineligible version to Medicaid so there are no \ncapitation fees being charged to the State. The system allows us to reverse that \nsuspension and reinstate those cases. There would be no fiscal note attached. \n \nSARAH K. HAWKINS (Nevada Attorneys for Criminal Justice): \nI proposed an amendment to S.B. 93 (Exhibit B) that would have prohibited the \ntermination of Medicaid benefits for incarcerated individuals. As written, it is \ndiscretionary. I have been made aware of a significant fiscal note attached to \nthe amendment that imperils the bill, so I am withdrawing the amendment. \n \nSTEVEN COHEN: \nI support S.B. 93. \n \nDARIN BALAAM (Sheriff, Washoe County): \nThe Washoe County Sheriff’s Office supports S.B. 93, particularly section 3. \nSuspending Medicaid for incarcerated individuals, as opposed to terminating, \nwill improve continuity of care and outcomes for individuals we serve in our \ncorrection and detention facilities. \n \nSeveral years ago, the Washoe County Sheriff’s Office formed a partnership \nwith the State, allowing us to help inmates incarcerated within the Washoe \nCounty  Detention  Facility  apply  for  Medicaid  before  they  are  released.  Our \nDetention Services Unit pulls a weekly report for inmates scheduled for release \nwithin ten days. Inmates who have indicated they would like services or are \neligible for Medicaid are screened and provided with applications; they fill those \nout, and we forward them on to the State office.  \n \nAbout  6  to  15  Medicaid  and/or  Supplemental  Nutrition  Assistance  Program \n(SNAP) applications a day are being sent from our office to the Division of \nWelfare  and  Supportive  Services.  This  shows  how  many  inmates  in  our \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 16, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nDetention Facility in Washoe County need Medicaid or SNAP. Because of our \npartnership with the State, we are able to notify these agencies two days prior \nto an inmate’s release. At that point, applications are processed so by the time \nthe inmate is released from our facility, Medicaid has been reinstated.  \n \nFor the many we serve, the program and services they want or need require \ninsurance.  The  Washoe  County  Sheriff’s  Office  believes  the  responsibility  is \nincumbent  upon  us  to  help  inmates  with  services  in  an  effort  to  reduce \nrecidivism and get them on the road to recovery. The level of inmates requiring \nmental  health  service,  whether  for  addiction  or  mental  illness,  continually \nincreases. Providing Medicaid prior to release helps them keep continuity of care \nupon release. Once they are released and not able to have Medicaid reinstated, \nwe  have  seen  them  turn  to  other  types  of  illegal  substances  to  medicate \nthemselves. This bill will help ensure the neediest among us will receive services \nthrough Medicaid or SNAP.  \n \nOur  Detention  Services  Unit  works  diligently  to  find  services  and  beds  for \ninmates prior to their release. This helps avoid delays in receiving Medicaid, \ntherefore avoiding delays in receiving care to make an impact on outcomes and \nrecidivism once released.  \n \nSERENA EVANS (Nevada Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual Violence): \nThe Nevada Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual Violence supports S.B. 93, \nparticularly section 3. We know many victim survivors are incarcerated for a \nmultitude of reasons, many of which are directly impacted because of their \nvictimization. For many survivors previously incarcerated, we consistently hear \nthey are not getting access to affordable health care. It is a challenge and can \nbe a barrier for overcoming previous victimization. We are in support of any \nmeasures ensuring incarcerated individuals and victim survivors have access to \naffordable healthcare upon their release so they can get back on track without \nhaving the burden of reapplying for eligibility in the Medicaid program. \n \nJOANNA JACOB (Clark County): \nClark County supports S.B. 93, particularly section 3. Last year, Clark County \nand our city colleagues took part in a working group on efforts to address \nhomelessness through the passage of A.B. No. 73 of the 80th Session. We had \nnumerous presentations from law enforcement and jails in southern Nevada that \ntalked  about  factors  driving  recidivism  which  had  to  do  with  the  concerns \nidentified by Sheriff Balaam in Washoe County. Access to medication, support, \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 16, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nhousing and linking people to a system of care as quickly as possible after \ndischarge  from  a  correctional  setting  is  important,  addressing  those  factors \ndriving recidivism. We believe the suspension, as opposed to termination of \nMedicaid, will help link those eligible into a system of care we know our State \nhas worked hard to develop. The Division of Welfare and Supportive Services \nhas  tried  to  partner  with  Clark  County  Detention  Center  to  bring  eligibility \nservices into a detention center.  \n \nCONNIE MCMULLEN (Personal Care Association of Nevada): \nThe Personal Care Association of Nevada stands neutral on S.B. 93. When the \nbill was initially presented, I thought most of what the bill sponsor wanted was \nalready in law. We are happy that section 2 is being clarified and placed into \nlaw. Some of our members are concerned for vulnerable people being placed in \na  situation  of  unlicensed  caregivers  and  the  attendant  oversight  of  those \ncaregivers. The fact that Mr. Nagel, who is able to live in his community in a \nless-restrictive setting, was forced to go into a nursing home was unnecessary. \nWe remain neutral but are not opposed. \n \nERIC SPRATLEY (Executive Director, Nevada Sheriffs’ and Chiefs’ Association): \nNevada Sheriffs’ and Chiefs’ Association supports S.B. 93. \n \nMS. HAWKINS: \nWe know there are fiscal benefits to S.B. 93 that promises to reduce recidivism. \nFor  my  clients,  once  individuals  are  stabilized  in  custody  on  mental  health \nmedication,  we  are  looking  for  continuity  of  care  that  keeps  them  on  their \nmedications, functioning well and being productive in the community with their \nfamilies. Too often, I see where the interruption in eligibility benefits causes a \nlapse in a person taking and having access to medication. I am in support of \nS.B. 93. \n \nJOHN  PIRO  (Deputy  Public  Defender,  Office  of  the  Public  Defender, \nClark County): \nOffices of the Clark and Washoe County Public Defenders support S.B. 93. \nSection 3 is the most important for continuity of care. There is nothing worse \nthan getting a mentally ill client in custody stabilized on the correct medications \nand then getting that person released without the proper medical coverage, \nincreasing the risk of recidivism.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 16, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 93. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRemainder of page intentionally left blank; signature page to follow.   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 16, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAs there is no public comment, this meeting is adjourned at 4:56 p.m. \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nVickie Polzien, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 16, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nExhibit  Begins \nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \nLetter  on Page \n  A  1    Agenda \nSarah K.

We are losing some great people to term limits this \nyear. Given this could be the last opportunity, I will have Senator Hardy Chair \nthis Committee meeting. \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nI will open the hearing on Assembly Bill (A.B.) 216. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 216 (1st Reprint): Requires Medicaid to cover certain services \nfor persons with cognitive impairments. (BDR 38-385) \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN MICHELLE GORELOW (Assembly District No. 35): \nI am here today to present A.B. 216. This bill mandates the State Plan for \nMedicaid  to  include  coverage  for  cognitive  assessment  and  care  planning \nservices  provided  to  persons  with  symptoms  of  cognitive  impairment—this \nwould include Alzheimer’s or dementia. \n \nAlzheimer’s disease is the single most expensive disease in the U.S., outpacing \nthe  cost  of  cancer  and  heart  disease.  An  analysis  by  the  Alzheimer’s \nAssociation calculated the direct cost posed to caregivers totaled $305 billion in \n2020, and the Association also estimates that Medicare and Medicaid covers \n67 percent of the total cost. \n \nThere are several early intervention and detection strategies that can avoid the \nastronomical  expenses  associated  with  late-stage  dementia  and  Alzheimer’s. \nThe  Milken  Institute  released  a  report  showing  early  diagnosis  in  the  mild \ncognitive impairment stage could create cost savings as much as $7.9 trillion in \nU.S.  health  and  long-term  care  expenditures  by  enabling  better  planning, \nmanagement and care. \n \nAssembly Bill 216 requires the State Plan for Medicaid cover the nonfederal \nshare  for  cognitive  assessment  and  care  planning  services  for  persons  with \ncognitive impairment symptoms. By funding assessments and care planning, we \ncan  get  ahead  of  cognitive  decline  to  ensure  those  suffering,  and  their \ncaregivers can manage the devastation of cognitive impairment. For families \nwith members who may have Alzheimer’s, this bill will ensure support services \nare in place as the disease progresses. This type of advanced care planning can \nprevent acute hospitalizations that can be traumatic for individuals and their \nfamilies and generate unnecessary expenses to the healthcare system.  \n \nMARY LIVERATTI (Nevada Commission on Aging): \nI  am  a  volunteer  with  the  Alzheimer’s  Association,  AARP  and  the  Nevada \nCommission on Aging, today representing the Nevada Commission on Aging. \nThis bill will allow families with members suffering from cognitive impairment \nmore time with physicians to do a thorough assessment and diagnosis and help \nwith care planning.  \n \nDementia is not just for seniors. Although we normally think of it as a disease of \npeople over 65, the Alzheimer’s Association estimates 5 percent of those with \ndementia have the young-onset form of Alzheimer’s—this is 200,000 people in \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nthe U.S. According to data from Medicaid, between fiscal year 2016 and 2020, \nover  4,000  individuals  under  65  already  in  the  Medicaid  program  had  a \ndiagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease or another dementia. \n \nDementia  is  more  prevalent  for  individuals  65  and  older.  According  to  a \n2015 survey  conducted  by  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services \n(DHHS), Nevada shows 16 percent, or 1 in 6 Nevadans between the ages of \n45 and 64 reported worsening confusion and memory loss we call subjective \ncognitive decline (SCD). This condition is associated with later development of \ndementia,  and  nearly  half  of  the  people  in  this  survey  had  not  talked  to  a \nhealthcare professional about their concerns. \n \nNot all people who experience or report SCD go on to develop dementia or need \nthis  comprehensive  service.  A  review  of  pertinent  research  conducted  by \ngraduate  students  at  the  University  of  Nevada  Reno,  School  of  Medicine, \nSanford Center for Aging found between 5 percent and 8 percent of those who \nreport SCD do develop mild cognitive decline or dementia. \n \nEarly and accurate diagnosis is important because young-onset dementia affects \nwork,  finance  and  family.  Many  times  people  are  still  employed  when  they \ndevelop dementia, and early and accurate diagnosis is crucial to rule out other \npotentially treatable conditions. To get the most appropriate treatment early in \nthe disease process is important. \n \nOne day my father believed there was an intruder in his home and called the \npolice. The police came; he did not believe they were the police and would not \nlet them enter his home. I spoke with a member of the Alzheimer’s Association \nwho told me dementia does not usually present this quickly and I should take \nhim to see a doctor. It turned out my father had a urinary tract infection which \ncaused the confusion and delusion, and he was diagnosed and provided with \nthe correct medication. It is important we have the correct screening because \nsometimes symptoms may not be dementia and can be treated appropriately. \n \nEarly and accurate diagnosis gives patients and their families more time to make \nimportant decisions about financial and legal issues. It allows individuals time to \nwork with their employers on work accommodations, disability coverage or early \nretirement options. It allows individuals to apply for disability insurance and \nsupplemental income benefits from the Social Security Administration. It allows \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nindividuals to access clinical trials ongoing across the Country. We will only find \na cure with research.  \n \nThe service we are asking for is already covered by Medicare and Tricare, and \nwas added to those programs in 2018. While Nevada Medicaid does not cover \nit, there are 15 other states that have this service. We feel there is future cost \nsavings through the Social Security Administration which has, for young-onset \nAlzheimer’s disease, a condition under its Compassionate Allowances program \ngiving anyone with the disease an expedited access to social security disability \ninsurance and supplemental security income (SSI).  \n \nThis can lead to significant savings to the State and our Medicaid program. \nAfter  a  two-year  waiting  period,  individuals  on  SSI  can  become  eligible  for \nMedicare.  This  shifts  the  medical  cost  from  Medicaid  to  the  fully  federally \nfunded Medicare program leading to future savings. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThere is a rare disease called Lewy body dementia. I am unaware if we have \nfound anything to help those with this disease.  \n \nCovid-19 creates brain fog, and we are not yet aware of the side effects from \nthis.  Are  there  any  studies  looking  into  how  this  might  link  to  early-onset \ndementia or Alzheimer’s? \n \nMS. LIVERATTI: \nThink of dementia as vegetables. Lewy body, Alzheimer’s, frontal and temporal \nissues are like carrots, celery and potatoes. Dementia is the overarching disease. \nWe are doing research, but I have not heard anything specific to Covid-19. I had \ncancer and went through chemotherapy and experienced brain fog associated \nwith that.  \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nIf they are not doing research on this, it may be worthwhile to do so because \nwe do not know enough about the long-term effects of the virus. \n \nAMY PETERSON: \nMy husband, Drew, celebrated his forty-seventh birthday living his dream as a \n737 captain for a major airline. He had a degree in engineering and owned, \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nrestored and maintained a fleet of vintage airplanes. He was an accomplished \nwoodworker, avid reader, traveler and history buff.  \n \nA month after his birthday, he surrendered his pilot’s license knowing he could \nno longer fly because he was making poor decisions. He was having trouble \nwith numbers, and there were things he was experiencing he knew were not \nnormal. I continued teaching for three years after his diagnosis, but when I \ncame home I never knew whether my husband would be Dr. Jekyll or Mr. Hyde. \nThe mood swings were increasing and depression was setting in, but he was \nvery good at hiding and compensating for his condition. \n \nI knew Alzheimer’s ran in his family but never imagined it would present in a \n47-year-old healthy man. His mother had Alzheimer’s and passed away when \nshe was 58 years old. He has two sisters, one of which has passed away. The \nother sister is in the middle to moderate stages of Alzheimer’s. \n \nThree years later, after MRIs, scans and tests, a DNA blood test confirmed a \ngenetic mutation on the 14th chromosome, and another procedure confirmed \nelevated  levels  of  tau  protein  in  his  spinal  fluid.  It  was  official—he  had \nAlzheimer’s disease. They referred to it as apolipoprotein E (APOe-4), a gene \nwhich is a rare form of Alzheimer’s; that presents itself in young-onset and \nfamilial cases. \n \nAfter  the  diagnosis,  there  was  a  flurry  of  getting  the  family  trust  in  order, \npowers of attorney and financial considerations in place for a man who could no \nlonger work. I could not return to work and became a fulltime caregiver because \nhe could not be left alone. He was forced to take medical retirement 18 years \nbefore his planned retirement at age 65. A friend suggested we apply for SSI. \nWe got the neurologist’s diagnosis in writing, numerous psychological tests, and \nfinally SSI was approved, which made him eligible for Medicare. \n \nHe eventually developed blood clots, both pulmonary and deep vein thrombosis, \nand became a wanderer and a fall risk. I was sleeping with one eye open and \nwas myself experiencing atrial fibrillation. The last 18 months of my husband’s \nlife were spent in a nice, clean, safe small group home specializing in dementia \nwhere  they  tended  to  his  every  need,  but  they  did  not  accept  Medicare. \nThankfully, SSI covered about 60 percent of his monthly care and the rest was \nan out-of-pocket expense. My husband took his last breath two weeks after his \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nfifty-eighth birthday. My husband of thirty years was now gone, and I was a \nwidow at 55 years of age.  \n \nI have been fortunate to volunteer for the Alzheimer’s Association for the past \nfive  years  doing  educational  presentations  and  facilitating  caregiver  support \ngroups for the Senior Center for the Southern Nevada State Veterans Home in \nBoulder City. \n \nMy story is not unique and the caregivers I work with share similar stories. \n \nDUANE  YOUNG  (Deputy  Administrator,  Division  of  Health  Care  Financing  and \nPolicy, Department of Health and Human Services): \nA fiscal note was removed because we believe there are savings based on \ndelaying care into nursing facilities and providing other services such as home \nhealth and personal care services. \n \nBARRY GOLD (AARP): \nMs. Liveratti mentioned earlier that dementia is not just for seniors. Alzheimer’s \nand all cognitive diseases can have a terrible impact on people earlier in their \nlives. On behalf of AARP, we support A.B. 216. \n \nMISTY GRIMMER (Alzheimer’s Association): \nThe Alzheimer’s Association supports A.B. 216. \n \nERIN LYNCH  (Social  Services  Chief  III,  Division  of  Health  Care  Financing  and \nPolicy, Department of Health and Human Services): \nWith the first reprint of the bill we have a fiscal note posted with a zero dollar \nimpact. \n \nJENNIFER  RICHARDS  (Chief  Elder  and  Disability  Rights  Attorney,  Aging  and \nDisability Services Division, Department of Health and Human Services): \nThis bill will have an impact on the populations the Division serves. This bill may \nreduce  unnecessary  guardianships  and  hospitalizations  in  our  State,  and  the \nDivision appreciates the insight on the fiscal note. \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nI will entertain a motion on A.B. 216. \n \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER MOVED TO DO PASS A.B. 216. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 216 and open the hearing on A.B. 191. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 191: Requires the State Plan for Medicaid to include coverage \nfor  the  services  of  a  community  health  worker  under  certain \ncircumstances. (BDR 38-449) \n \nASSEMBLYMAN DAVID ORENTLICHER (Assembly District No. 20): \nI am here to present A.B. 191 which requires Medicaid to reimburse services \nprovided  by  community  health  workers.  By  doing  so,  this  will  increase  the \ncapacity of our healthcare system for prevention and early treatment leading to \nconsiderable cost savings. \n \nJAY  KOLBET-CLAUSELL,  MSW  (Program  Manager,  Nevada  Community  Health \nWorker Association): \nPresenting  this  abridged  A.B.  191  slide  show,  Medicaid  reimbursements  for \ncommunity health workers, (Exhibit B), is a privilege. The full presentation was \nrecorded in the March 8 Assembly Health and Human Services meeting. \n \nCommunity  health  workers  (CHW)  are  community  members  who  bridge  the \ngaps in Nevada’s healthcare system. They come from underserved rural and \nurban  communities  and  represent  the  diversity  of  our  State  in  the  medical \nservice  sector.  Medical  CHWs  provide  education  and  training  for  patient \nself-management and are defined in Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 449.0027. \n \nThe Division of Public and Behavioral Health studied CHW service in our State \nand  found  a  nearly  $2  savings  for  every  $1  spent.  Emergency  room  visits \ndecreased 14 percent, urgent care visits by 6 percent, acute admissions by \n18 percent, and repeat hospital visits by 20 percent when CHWs were utilized \nto manage chronic illnesses. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nAdditional information may be found on the Nevada Community Health Worker \nAssociation, <NVCHWA.org>, website. We have submitted a list of supporting \ngroups (Exhibit C). \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nWhat  would  it  entail  if  we  consider  sharing  the  nonfederal  portion  of \nexpenditures, and who will be paid, the physician, physician assistant (PA), \nadvance practice registered nurse (APRN) or the CHW? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nWe would set this up as a separate provider type. The CHW would enroll in \nMedicaid but would be linked to a physician, APRN or PA. The CHW would bill \nwith the enrollment link and be reimbursed as a separate provider type. \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nWhere does the money go? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nThe money goes to the enrolled provider. That provider could have another \narrangement with the supervising provider who does the billing collectively for \nthe group; this is not an arrangement Medicaid is involved in. \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nSo  the  money  goes  to  the  CHW  under  the  auspices  of  the  license  of  the \nphysician, APRN or PA? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nCorrect. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nWhat,  if  anything,  are  we  doing  to  ensure  CHWs  are  representative  of  the \ndiverse communities in Nevada? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nThere is language in NRS that CHWs must be representative of the communities \nthey  serve.  Existing  CHWs  utilized  through  community  coalitions,  local \nhospitals,  qualified  health  centers  and  grants  represent  that  community  and \nbilingual or multilingual to reflect the needs of the community they serve. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nSometimes, NRS does not translate into reality. My concern would be that if we \nare going to implement this, we make sure to represent the communities we \nserve. We need to be intentional in reaching out to Black, Indigenous and People \nof Color (BIPOC) communities to ensure we partner with the people doing the \nwork due to what happened during the Covid-19 pandemic. \n \nMR. KOLBET-CLAUSELL: \nThis is a concern for the Community Health Worker Association. We do not \nhave a diverse health workforce in Nevada, and CHWs are the easiest to work \nwith. We are starting programs in high schools and bringing in new instructors \nwho represent different communities. We have an instructor from Fernley and \none from an urban Las Vegas community who will start in June. By representing \neveryone in those instructors and the work pool we have, we are able to bring \nin a more diverse workforce that can go on to social work positions or pursue \nhigher nursing degrees. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nAs a State, we might do better by going to the people that know the people. By \ngoing to churches, fraternities, sororities, community organizations and listening \nsessions we can find out what to do differently and how often. We should have \na way to relate to the community to develop trust. My fear is that if there is no \nintentionality about ensuring we are reaching out and acknowledging diversity, \nthis bill will end up the same way any other bill ends; nothing will happen \nexcept for good intensions that go nowhere. \n \nMR. KOLBET-CLAUSELL: \nWe are applying for funding to hire CHWs directly in these communities from \nevery source we can find. We have Covid-19 relief funds specifically targeted to \nLatino and Native American tribal agencies. We are looking at updating our \ncurriculum  by  bringing  in  consultants  from  the  communities  to  review  the \nlanguage and work to address those issues. \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nWhen a PA is working with a physician, there is typically an agreement in place. \nThe State Board of Medical Examiners is interested in what that agreement is \nand that we have an official designation for who the physician is supervising. \nWhat are the ways those agreements have worked or are working? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nMR. KOLBET-CLAUSELL: \nMost states that have CHWs have a more broad supervision provision than what \nwe are proposing. Our conservative method is a great way to start this program. \nThese other programs will use social workers and different provider types to be \nsupervisors. We are not proposing that. We are looking at a structured setup \nwhere CHWs will have a license that has been approved. They will be working \nwith physicians, APRNs and PAs with a lot of support for the employer, the \nCHW Association and national partners. We know CHWs are qualified to do the \nwork and able to connect to the tasks they are not able to perform. \n \nI am looking at the responsivity and accountability piece. We want this program \nto  be  successful.  We  need  more  outreach  workers  to  see  clients. \nAssembly Bill 191 is looking to expand this so we do not demand so much of \nour  healthcare  systems.  We  are  catching  things  early,  teaching  things  in  a \nculturally relevant way in the appropriate languages directly in the communities, \nschools, homes and churches where people live to build trusting relationships. \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nNevada Revised Statutes 449.0027 describes a CHW as an unlicensed person. \nAre you talking about licensing or certifying someone separate and distinct? \n \nMR. KOLBET-CLAUSELL: \nA CHW is not required to have a license to be called a CHW. For Medicaid \nreimbursement, that license will need to be pursued. \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nFor  the  purposes  of  enrollment,  the  CHW  will  need  to  have  a  license  and \npresent it at the time of enrollment. \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nIs there a license under a board and a fee for that license; is this in the bill? \n \nMR. KOLBET-CLAUSELL: \nThis  has  been  created  and  we  are  running  classes  for  the  licensing.  Many \nemployers are using the program even though it has not been tied to Medicaid. \nThis bill is not about creating the program, this is about Medicaid reimbursing \nthe staff serving Medicaid clients. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nWhere in statute does the licensing appear? Does it appear in NRS chapter 222? \n \nERIC ROBBINS (Counsel): \nCommunity health workers are not a licensed profession under Nevada law; \nhowever, CHW pools are licensed under chapter 449 of NRS. \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nWhat defines a pool? \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nPer NRS 449.0028: \n \n“Community health worker pool” means a person or agency which \nprovides,  for  compensation  and  through  its  employees  or  by \ncontract  with  community  health  workers,  the  services  of \ncommunity health workers to any natural person, medical facility or \nfacility  for  the  dependent.  The  term  does  not  include  an \nindependent contractor who personally provides the services of a \ncommunity health worker or a facility for the dependent or any \nmedical facility other than a community health worker pool which \nprovides the services of a community health worker. \n \nIf CHWs are working for another type of facility, they would be covered by that \nfacility’s license. If it is an entity that arranges for CHWs to provide services to \npeople or facilities, they would be licensed as a community health worker pool. \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nThis bill would allow a pool to be paid and the pool would pay the CHW, but the \nCHW would not be an independent other than if they are working under the \npool, correct? \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nIf CHWs are working for a facility, they would be paid through that facility. If \nthey are working for a physician, APRN or PA in their individual capacity, they \ncould be reimbursed through that provider. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nSo the CHW would receive payment from the supervising physician, APRN or \nPA, or the pool? \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nThe CHWs would receive payment from the pool or facility they are working for. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThe CHW models I am familiar with are generally working for agencies including \nnonprofit  agencies.  They  have  to  be  supervised  by  the  list  of  licensed \nprofessionals but not necessarily sponsored by them. The agency would pay the \nCHW and also pay the physician, APRN or PA, but it is not necessarily a direct \npay  relationship  between  the  two.  There  must  always  be  a  supervisory \nrelationship between the two, is that correct? \n \nASSEMBLYMAN ORENTLICHER: \nThat is correct. \n \nMR. KOLBET-CLAUSELL: \nThe certification we have is through the Nevada Certification Board. It is not a \nlicense. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThis is similar to the peer support specialist bill we heard earlier this Session. \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nThe agency or facility would have requirements for whom they employ and \nsupervise. Would the CHW be in a position to receive remuneration through this \nbill for the services he or she provides? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nYes. The step moving forward is a sustainable business model that allows us to \nemploy more critical members of the healthcare team. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nIs it possible to partner with the Office of Minority Health and Equity to do \noutreach and gain cultural competency for the CHWs? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nMR. KOLBET-CLAUSELL: \nWe are partnered with them and are looking at hiring some of their stakeholders \nfor our staff. \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nWe  require  licensure  or  certification,  and  in  this  case,  certification  as  a \nrequirement of enrollment. The physician, APRN or PA is the supervisor because \nthey are the employed agencies, federally qualified health centers and a myriad \nof  Medicaid  providers.  This  would  provide  Medicaid  providers  the  Medicaid \nreimbursement.  The  arrangement  may  be  multivaried  based  upon  current \npayment arrangements. \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nIs there a criteria or curriculum for the CHW before they are hired, or is it up to \nthe facility or agency that hires them to provide the scope of practice? \n \nMR. KOLBET-CLAUSELL: \nWe do have a curriculum with the Nevada Certification Board and are looking at \nupdating  that  curriculum.  Those  classes  are  an  eight-week  program  that  is \nongoing and popular. There are two other programs in the State; one at the \nCollege of Southern Nevada and the other at Truckee Meadows Community \nCollege. All three work together and apply jointly for funding. \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nThis bill will provide a stream of income that will give CHWs the motivation to \nwork within the system and expand healthcare delivery in shortage areas and \nBIPOC communities, and you are committed in that direction. \n \nMR. KOLBET-CLAUSELL: \nThat is true. \n \nKATIE ROE RYAN (Dignity Health-St. Rose Dominican): \nDignity Health provided a letter of support (Exhibit D) from Holly Lyman and are \ngrateful the Interim committee on Health brought this up as one of its issues. \nDuring  normal  circumstances,  we  have  CHWs  and  promotors  out  in  the \ncommunity teaching about disease and chronic conditions. It has been different \nwith the pandemic, but we have been doing it virtually. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nKENDALL LYONS (Children’s Advocacy Alliance): \nChildren’s Advocacy Alliance supports A.B. 191. I am a former CHW for a \nMedicaid managed care organization in Nevada and have seen firsthand how \nimpactful a CHW is to families new to Nevada or the Medicaid system. The \nability  to  connect  directly  with  someone  like  a  CHW  who  understands  the \ncomplicated  healthcare  system  and  resource  landscape  in  Nevada  helps \nminimize the stress that makes accessing health care feel burdensome for many. \n \nIn  my  two  years  as  a  CHW,  I  connected  people  with  their  primary  care \nphysicians,  advocated  for  them  to  ensure  timely  delivery  of  prescription \nmedications and connected them with community-based resources that helped \nto  minimize  the  barriers  to  care,  such  as  transportation,  energy  and  food \nassistance programs. \n \nThis bill will not only save the State money, it will help people; any legislation \nthat can do both is good policy. \n \nLEANN MCALLISTER (Nevada Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics): \nI offer support for A.B. 191 on behalf of the Nevada Chapter of the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics (Nevada AAP). Community health workers play a crucial \nrole  in  the  dissemination  of  medically  accurate  information  to  various \ncommunities.  In  one  specific  study,  research  showed  CHWs  significantly \nimproved  the  health  outcomes  of  children  with  asthma.  They  have  great \npotential to improve key access to health care and increase families’ adherence \nto provider’s recommendations.  \n \nThe  Nevada  AAP  has  more  than  250  members,  most  of  whom  are \nboard-certified  pediatricians  who  provide  both  primary  and  specialty  care. \nMembers  also  include  pediatric  nurse  practitioners,  physician  assistants, \npediatric residents and medical students, all of whom live and work in Nevada \nand have dedicated their professional lives to the health of all children. \n \nJOAN HALL (Nevada Rural Hospital Partners Foundation): \nNevada  Rural  Hospital  Partners  Foundation  supports  A.B.  191.  Community \nhealth  workers  are  trustworthy  individuals  who  share  life  experiences  and \nculture with those they serve. They are trained to navigate systems, such as \nhealth  care,  housing,  insurance  enrollment  and  transportation,  and  link \ncommunity and clinical services to help people in their own communities lead \nhealthier lives and understand disease and injury prevention measures. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, in the rural communities we saw firsthand the \nvalue when CHWs reached out to our migrant farm workers and tribal members \nwith information and education on preventative measures, assistance in getting \ntesting and vaccinations. Reimbursement for these services is important and \nmore affordable than other alternatives. We have worked many years on this \nconcept and urge your support for A.B. 191. \n \nMS. LYNCH: \nThe Aging and Disability Division is neutral on A.B. 191 in that we have a cost \nsavings that has been posted as a fiscal note. \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nI will entertain a motion on A.B. 191. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER MOVED TO DO PASS A.B. 191. \n \nSENATOR RATTI SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE  MOTION  CARRIED.  (SENATOR  HARRIS  WAS  ABSENT  FOR  THE \nVOTE.) \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 191 and open the hearing on A.B. 256. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 256 (1st Reprint): Provides for Medicaid coverage of doula \nservices. (BDR 38-849) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN SHONDRA SUMMERS-ARMSTRONG (Assembly District No. 6): \nI am here today to present A.B. 256 which will enable Medicaid coverage for \nnonmedical doula support services. \n \nIn January 1987, I found out I was pregnant with my first child. I was living \nwith my first husband in the small town of Sispec, West Germany, at an Air \nForce  forward  operating  location.  The  nearest  military  hospital  was  over \ntwo hours away in the port town of Gramerhoffen, West Germany. Because of \nthe distance between where we lived and the military hospital, I was given the \noption of either going to Gramerhoffen two weeks before my due date and stay \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nthere until I gave birth or have services at the local German hospital. I decided \nto have the baby at the local hospital.  \n \nI did not know at the time that part of the continuum of care in that region was \nthe services of a midwife. The midwife who helped me was a stout, dark haired, \nno-nonsense woman who spoke very little English. Although she had a firm \ndemeanor, she exuded kindness and competence, which was just what I needed \nas  a  first-time  mother  5,000  miles  away  from  my  mother.  She  provided \neverything I needed at that time. Our first meeting was at my home, and my \nlandlord’s wife acted as the interpreter. My midwife asked lots of questions and \nmade suggestions such as placement of the baby in the window every day. I did \nnot realize Black babies needed vitamin D and sunlight. She talked to me about \nhow to position the baby during the day so he would not have aspirations and \nsudden  infant  death  syndrome.  I  was  able  to  attend  Lamaze  and \nLa Leche League classes in her home. The first floor of her home was padded, \nand a dozen young mothers went there on a weekly basis for this training.  \n \nShe was my rock during the birthing process. Epidurals are not common in their \nhealthcare delivery system, and she helped me get through the breathing and \nconcentration with touch and encouragement. After the baby was born, she \nvisited me every day in the hospital. At that time, new mothers stayed in the \nhospital for six days. This woman, who acted as my mother, made sure I got \nthe best care possible.  \n \nThis story illustrates the difference it can make when a mother has support \nbefore,  during  and  after  delivery.  Today’s  best  practices  tell  us  nonmedical \ndoula  services  are  great  at  providing  support  for  the  mother,  which  is  the \nmidwife’s job, and the physician delivers the baby. When Quentin Savwoir came \nto me with this legislation, the first thing that came to mind was the amazing \nexperience of the birth of my first son.  \n \nQUENTIN SAVWOIR (Make it Work Nevada): \nMake it Work Nevada builds power around economic, racial and reproductive \njustice. Part of our mission is to advocate for the health and vitality of our \ncommunity members, and A.B. 256 is anchored in that intention. We are facing \na national maternal health crisis in this Country  since the  U.S. is the most \ndangerous place in the developed world for an expectant parent to give birth. \nThe reality is even more dismal for Black women who die at disproportionately \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nhigher  rates  than  their  counterparts.  Forty-three  Black  women  die  every \n100,000 live births; this is unacceptable in the greatest Nation on earth. \n \nWhen I first learned of this statistic, it devastated me because I know how I feel \nabout my own mother, and because I could not help think about all future \nNevadans  that  would  be  born  into  this  world  without  their  mothers.  I  was \novercome with grief wondering how many of these children would never know \nthe unconditional love and comforting warmth of their mother. It did not take \nlong to find out the national trends we are facing as a Country are particularly \npresent right here in Nevada. We conducted field research and a series of focus \ngroups to best understand the health needs of our community members.  \n \nOur Black women’s agenda survey of more than 1,000 Black women in Nevada \ndiscovered that more than a fifth of respondents reported maternal health as \ntheir  most  preeminent  and  pressing  issue.  We  also  found  that  one-fifth  of \nrespondents  reported  feeling  they  had  no  control  over  their  bodies  or  the \ndecisions associated with their bodies.  \n \nIn the series of focus groups we hosted, we were able to dig a little deeper. It \nwas in these conversations we learned the troubling realities postpartum has on \nnew parents. The women and birth parents we spoke to talked about feeling \nstressed  and  fatigued,  and  they  experienced  hardships  with  chest  or  breast \nfeeding among other hardships that a nonmedical doula would be aptly capable \nof supporting a parent through.  \n \nIn these same conversations, nearly a third of our participants reported not \nhaving access to prenatal care at all. These conversations culminated with our \ncommunity members revealing doulas would be the most helpful resource during \npregnancy alongside parenting classes and additional resources to help with \npostpartum depression.  \n \nOur  research  and  conversations  resulted  in  the  pursuit  of  this  legislation. \nExpanding Medicaid to provide doula services to mothers and expectant parents \nis one of the best ways to mitigate subpar birth outcomes, ensure new Nevadan \nchildren are getting a healthy and thriving start, and serve as a cost-saving \nmeasure for our State. There is immeasurable value in having support, guidance \nand an ally when navigating the logistics, uncertainty and newness of childbirth. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nResearch has found that mothers and expectant parents who have access to \ndoulas have improved birth and overall health outcomes. Assembly Bill 256 is \ncommunity-driven policy. At its core, it is about the type of future we want our \nchildren to have, one where we see value in their lives before they arrive—one \nwhere  we  ensure  their  mother  or  birth  parent  has  access  to  any  and  all \nresources that can ensure a safe and healthy birth, and a postpartum period met \nwith support and ease instead of trauma and stress. We can do something \nabout this, and we should. \n \nJOLINA SIMPSON (President, Kijiji Sisterhood): \nKijiji  Sisterhood  is  a  nonprofit  in  Las  Vegas  that  supports  Black  and  Brown \nbirthing people through the prenatal, birth and postpartum process.  \n \nI want to talk about the real, intangible and necessary support having a doula \nprovides in our communities. Doulas are a bridge for our birthing families. We sit \nin living rooms listening to the concerns, hopes  and  birthing  plans,  building \nrelationships that connect to the hearts and desires of birthing families as they \nwork  to  bring  healthy  babies  into  the  world.  Doulas  are  coach,  confidant, \nteacher and hype man. We stand beside and hold space for our strong birthing \npeople.  Through  education,  conversation  and  support,  we  provide  vital \nconnections to understanding and navigating the birth process. \n \nDoulas provide support and advocacy in ways our medical system often cannot. \nWe feed the humanness of birthing persons. We care for them in the community \nbecause we care deeply for our community. Research shows doula care can \nhelp  mitigate  some  of  the  negative  social  determinates  of  health,  such  as \npoverty and systemic racism, which can negatively impact birthing outcomes. \nDoula  care  provides  clients  with  a  sense  of  agency,  feelings  of  personal \nsecurity,  respect  and  autonomy.  They  provide  knowledge  transference  and \nconnectedness.  In  communities  of  color,  rural  environments  and  low-income \ncommunities, this translates to better birth and postpartum outcomes.  \n \nUnfortunately, support is not always available to underresourced members of \nour community because the cost of being poor is high and their working dollars \ngo  toward  maintaining  households  and  navigating  tenuous  financial \ncircumstances. Having a doula should not be a luxury.  \n \nKijiji Sisterhood provides a continuity of care that brings community with us \nwhen we step into the hospital with our clients. We also provide support and \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nresources to our clients when they go home. We have eyes, hands and hearts \non our clients. We stand in the gap to provide resources to protect birthing \npersons and their new babies. Because we take time to build relationships with \nclients, we are often the first call when they have questions or concerns. We \nreaffirm  them  as  parents  and  connect  them  with  medical  providers  and \ncommunity resources such as lactation professionals, affinity support groups \nand mental health providers. \n \nDoula work is work. I have been a birth professional in Las Vegas for 18 years \nand have seen families choose unsupported birth and postpartum because they \nwere  unable  to  finance  it.  I  have  personally  sat  in  the  living  rooms  of \npostpartum families with mothers who are exhibiting suicidal ideation, and I \nstayed  with  those  mothers  until  their  partners  could  get  home  and  provide \nsupport. We connected them with emotional, educational and medical support \nand, with their permission, provided reports to their care providers so they could \nbe brought into the loop to support these families. \n \nDoulas  spend  hours  in  direct,  one-on-one  care  with  each  client.  Doulas  in \ncommunities will often reduce their fees or go unpaid to support families at their \nown financial expense. Paying community doulas is one way to support health \nand  economic  well-being  within  our  communities.  Simply  because  birthing \npersons are unable to pay for the expanding rates of private doula care does not \nmean they are any less deserving of this protection and support. \n \nBy allowing equitable Medicaid reimbursement, we can serve our communities \nin a way that is financially viable for birthing families, community and doulas. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN SUMMERS-ARMSTRONG: \nOur next presenter, Lauren Kalogridis, has provided presentation (Exhibit E) she \nwill review during her testimony on A.B. 256. \n \nLAUREN KALOGRIDIS: \nI am a psychotherapist focusing on perinatal mental health as well as doulas \nwith Reno Doula Project and Bright Heart Birth Services. I am also the program \nmanager of Thrive Wellness of Reno’s It Takes a Village program, which is the \nonly  intensive  outpatient  mental  health  treatment  program  in  Nevada \nspecializing in the treatment of perinatal mood and anxiety disorders impacting \nupwards of 20 percent of birthing people. Those numbers are disproportionately \nhigh during the pandemic. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nIn my role at Thrive, I see high rates of perinatal mood and anxiety disorders \nand  corresponding  birth  trauma,  lack  of  social  support  concerning  birth  and \nother factors that doulas can directly reduce and positively impact. \n \nDoulas are key referral resources who send struggling parents to us and link \nthem to psychiatric and medical support, and community resource support they \nneed and deserve. They leverage the trust and deep knowing they have of their \nclients to connect them to the care needed when things are most dire. \n \nBeyond  the  central  goal  of  preventing  human  suffering  related  to  perinatal \nmental health struggles, it is also reasonable to assess doulas pose additional \ncost  savings  potential  in  terms  of  preventing  and  lessening  the  need  for \nadditional psychiatric and mental health treatment postpartum many insurers are \npaying  for  at  great  lengths.  In  this  way,  doula  coverage  is  a  powerful \nintervention, meeting the DHHS triple aim of improving health outcomes, quality \nof care and cost savings. \n \nDoulas offer the continuity of care and strength-based human-centered support \nour healthcare system is sorely missing, a lack that disproportionately impacts \nthe most at risk in our communities including folks on Medicaid. The expansion \nof  Medicaid  coverage  in  Nevada  would  benefit  all  parties  involved  from \nhealthcare providers looking to improve birth outcomes, overextended nurses on \nlabor  and  delivery  floors,  insurers  looking  for  cost-saving  opportunities  and \ndoulas hustling out of pocket to ensure people in their communities have access \nto the support they deserve. All birthing people deserve to have experiences \nthat are supportive, safe and dignified. \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nWe have information on Cost Savings for Medicaid Programs (Exhibit F) and a \nSummary of Doula State Savings (Exhibit G) that have been provided to us. We \nalso have a negative fiscal note, so this bill will save money.  \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nUnlike the first two bills we heard this Session, it looks like doula services are \nnot no automatically eligible service for Medicaid, and it requires we apply for a \nwaiver. Can anyone available walk us through the process for applying for the \nwaiver and what the conditions of that waiver are? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nThe language in the bill is written as a State Plan or waiver. We do not have to \napply  for  a  waiver  for  these  services  since  we  can  add  this  through  the \nState Plan process and not have that additional financial impact. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nWould the intention be to put this in the next State Plan amendment? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nYes, the effective date is the first of the year. During the Interim, we would \nwork  with  stakeholders  on  a  provision  in  the  bill  stating  we  determine  the \nenrollment based off the work with stakeholders. There are several different \nnational recommendations and certifications we would apply this to. We would \nbuild the State, as well as the corresponding policy, and have that ready to roll \nout at the beginning of the year. \n \nCHRISTINE SAUNDERS (Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada): \nThe Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada supports A.B. 256. Nevada has \nmade a commitment to addressing maternal mortality, but there are still women \nwho have been left behind. According to the National Academy for State Health \nPolicy, Black and Indigenous women are three to four times more likely to die \nfrom pregnancy-related causes than White women.  \n \nDoulas are an effective part of the  healthcare  system. Culturally competent \ndoulas  are  able  to  provide  support  and  care  to  improve  birth  outcomes  for \nwomen of color. Data shows doula-assisted mothers were four times less likely \nto have a low birthweight baby, two times less likely to experience a birth \ncomplication  involving  themselves  or  their  babies,  less  likely  to  require  a \ncesarean section and significantly more likely to initiate breastfeeding.  \n \nMedicaid coverage of doula care will ensure all future Nevadans, regardless of \ntheir family’s economic status, are born with the best possible health outcomes \nand support from the State. \n \nMS. LYONS:  \nChildren’s Advocacy Alliance supports A.B. 256. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nREGAN COMIS (Anthem, Inc.): \nAnthem,  Inc.,  supports  A.B.  256.  According  to  America’s  health  rankings, \nNevada  ranks  forty-sixth  of  the  50  states  when  it  comes  to  women  and \nchildren’s health, mostly due to the State’s low position of population ratios. \nWe also recognize women who are Medicaid beneficiaries are at the highest risk \nof poor birth outcomes in the U.S., and women of color are especially vulnerable \nand face many barriers when accessing doulas. \n \nFor these reasons, Anthem and the Reno Doula Project are working together to \nlaunch a new maternal health project in Washoe County with the intention to \nexpand, making doula services available to our beneficiaries at no cost. As we \nlook for ways to improve Nevada’s maternal health and infant rankings, we \nsupport innovative solutions to improve health outcomes and believe doulas can \nhelp  decrease  mortality  and  improve  birth  outcomes  for  women  and  infants \ncovered by Medicaid. \n \nJIMMY LAU (Dignity Health-St. Rose Dominican): \nDignity Health-St. Rose Dominican supports A.B. 256. \n \nAMBER FALGOUT (Battle Born Progress): \nBattle Born Progress supports A.B. 256. This bill expands coverage for doulas \nand is right for mothers, especially mothers of color. \n \nCHRISTINA HERNANDEZ: \nI urge the committee to support A.B. 256. \n \nEMILY BARNEY: \nI work as a birth and postpartum doula with Bright Heart Birth Services, the \nReno Doula Project and as a member of the Washoe County Doula Pilot Program \nsponsored  by  Anthem.  I  am  a  voice  of  many,  and  everyone  has  done  an \nincredible job of advocating for doulas in the community. I support A.B. 256, \nespecially for families of color who have not had access to doulas for far too \nlong and need more resources to improve their birth outcomes and decrease the \nlikelihood of negative birth outcomes in the maternal mortality crisis. \n \nSARAH GEOWALTON (Bright Heart Birth Services; Truckee Meadows BirthNetwork; \nReno Doula Project): \nI am the sitting Director at Reno Doula Project which started in 2012 as a way \nto  help  parents  access  doula  support.  Historically,  having  a  doula  was \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \nsomething only people of privilege were allowed to access. The Reno Doula \nProject’s  mission  is  to  close  the  gap,  placing  the  cost  of  a  doula  on  an \nincome-based sliding scale to ensure families of all income levels are able to hire \na doula. This is an important and personal goal of mine.  \n \nThere is no doubt that doulas provide a necessary service. Birthing people who \nhave doulas attend their births have lower rates of unnecessary interventions \nduring labor and higher rates of birthing satisfaction. \n \nIn addition to the Reno Doula Project, I am a birth and postpartum doula, a \ncertified childbirth educator, owner of a local family resource center and the \nowner of Bright Heart Birth Services. Bright Heart works tirelessly to make the \nrole of doula legitimate within the field. We are not medical professionals, but \nwe are professionals. Careful attention to scope of practice, continued training \nand commitment to our clients before, during and after labor has paved the path \nfor doulas to be well regarded in my community. \n \nI support A.B. 256, doulas at more births, and including doula services into \nMedicaid-covered benefits Statewide for Nevadans. \n \nJENNA COLE: \nI am a postpartum doula for Bright Heart Birth Services and support A.B. 256. \n \nKATIE NEASE (Health Plan of Nevada): \nHealth Plan of Nevada supports A.B. 256. Our focus and commitment is helping \npeople  in  the  community  overcome  health  disparities  and  improve  birth \noutcomes.  This  month,  as  part  of  this  effort,  we  launched  a  doula  pilot  in \nClark County to provide peer support to pregnant women through pregnancy, \ndelivery  and  postpartum.  We  are  working  in  collaboration  with \nobstetrician-gynecologist providers to assemble this birth team. Our aim is to \nsurround the expectant mother with support to meet her physical, emotional \nand psychosocial needs. \n \nAs  we  began  having  these  conversations  with  doula  organizations  in  the \ncommunity, the cost of training and certification was identified as a barrier. To \naddress  this  barrier  and  support  diversity  in  the  workforce,  we  provide \nscholarships to novices to become trained, certified doulas. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \nMS.

COHEN (Assembly District No. 29): \nI am here to present A.B. 192 which came out of the Legislative Committee on \nHealth  Care  from  the  2019-2020  Interim.  Two  of  the  priorities  for  that \nCommittee were public and maternal child health, and this bill addresses both. \n \nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sexually \ntransmitted diseases can cause pregnancy complications and result in serious \nconsequences  for  the  mother  and  the  developing  baby.  In  2019,  the  CDC \nidentified  newborn  deaths  from  syphilis  as  “the  most  alarming  threat”  and \nemphasized the need to test all pregnant women for syphilis in line with CDC \nrecommendations. In 2018, we had the highest rates of primary and secondary \nsyphilis in the Nation. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \nThis problem is acute in the Las Vegas, Henderson and Paradise region which \nhad the highest rates of primary and secondary syphilis in all metropolitan areas \nthat report to the CDC. We also had the second highest rate in congenital \nsyphilis, which is when a mother with syphilis passes the infection on to her \nbaby during pregnancy. \n \nUnfortunately,  trends  have  not  been  moving  in  the  right  direction  for  us. \nAccording  to  the  CDC,  Nevada  saw  a  289  percent  increase  in  congenital \nsyphilis between 2015 and 2018. Congenital syphilis can significantly affect a \nbaby’s health. It can cause miscarriage, stillborn births, prematurity, low birth \nweight or death. Up to 40 percent of babies born to women with untreated \nsyphilis may be stillborn or die from the infection as a newborn. Congenital \nsyphilis can also result in deformed bones, enlarged liver and spleen, brain and \nnerve problems, and a host of other health issues. \n \nThe good news is that both syphilis and congenital syphilis are preventable. \nSyphilis can be treated and cured with antibiotics, and congenital syphilis can \nalso be treated. Babies who have it need to be treated as soon as possible to \nreduce their risk of serious conditions. \n \nThe key to treatment and prevention are ensuring mothers are tested for syphilis \nand  receive  prenatal  care  as  necessary.  Assembly  Bill  192  aims  to  align \nNevada’s  sexually  transmitted  disease  testing  requirements  with  CDC \nrecommendations. \n \nBRADLEY  MAYER  (Southern  Nevada  Health  District;  Washoe  County  Health \nDistrict): \nThis is an important bill, and both Southern Nevada and Washoe County Health \nDistricts support A.B. 192. We heard about Nevada’s battle with syphilis, and \nour sexually transmitted disease rates are high across the board. Nevada is first \nfor primary and secondary syphilis and second for congenital syphilis. There is \nmore that needs to be done overtime, and we will need to continue to take a \nlook at this. \n \nMS. LYNCH: \nThe Aging and Disability Services Division is neutral on A.B. 192.

The purpose of this bill is to increase \ntransparency  for  consumers  of  cannabis  products  in  Nevada.  The  Cannabis \nCompliance Board has the authority to develop and publish data collected via \nthe seed-to-sale software known as Metrc. \n \nLaboratory data is one of the most important subsets of data available through \nthe Metrc program. Laboratory data tells us the level of tetrahydrocannabinol in \neach batch of tested product, as well as potential contaminants such as mold or \ntoxins, and is used to ensure customer safety. \n \nSince  the  inception  of  the  medical-  and  recreational-use  regulations,  the \nrespective regulatory and compliance agencies have set standards for cannabis \nproducts verified through licensed independent laboratories. The results of these \nlaboratory tests are available upon request by the consumer; however, there is \nno  way  to  receive  a  complete  set  of  laboratory  analysis  of  products  from \nproducers that is readily available or accessible by the public. \n \nI am a data nerd and can take raw data and make it statistically significant, run \ntrends and analysis, and describe those things in a report. However, that is \nsometimes not the best way for the public to obtain this information. We are \nlooking at a data process that publishes metric data so the public has access to \nall of that data in one place. \n \nWe are just starting to scratch the surface on the value of data in this body and \nthe  stories  that  data  can  tell  us.  In  this  industry,  accessing  the  data  can \nsafeguard  consumers  from  inadvertently  consuming  products  they  may  not \nwant to consume. It may also tell stories about producer practices such as \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 27, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nshopping  for  results—and  inconsistency  in  laboratory  results  can  expose \ndangerous practices of analytical manipulation—which can potentially put the \npublic in harm. \n \nSection  1  proposes  a  database  be  developed  that  contains  all  laboratory \ninformation related to cannabis products sold in Nevada. In the Assembly, we \namended it to ensure this was in a readily accessible format so anyone can \ndownload the Metrc sheets. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWere sections 1 and 2 deleted by amendment? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS: \nYes.

The  intent  of  this  bill  is  to  improve  care \ntransitions to the community for incarcerated individuals eligible for Medicaid.  \n \nIndividuals who are incarcerated in our prisons often have significant physical \nand  mental  healthcare  needs.  They  may  experience  chronic  and  infectious \ndiseases, such as hepatitis C, and may suffer from severe mental health and \nsubstance abuse disorders at a much higher rate than our general population. \nThe Covid-19 pandemic showed us how vulnerable many of these individuals \nare. Many have suffered this horrible disease while incarcerated when we had \nsevere outbreaks in our prisons. \n \nWe want to improve health care for all individuals recently released from prison. \nThis action will help to improve the overall health in our communities, lower the \nspending on State health care and potentially advance public safety goals such \nas successful reentry reducing recidivism. \n \nWe  have  many  individuals  in  our  criminal  justice  system  who  qualify  for \nMedicaid since Nevada expanded eligibility for low-income adults through the \nAffordable Care Act. Medicaid plays a key role in providing support for these \nindividuals. Many incarcerated individuals are often disproportionately poor and \npeople of color. This bill helps to address their healthcare needs while advancing \nhealth and racial equality in Nevada. \n \nIn 2019, 43 states had a policy to suspend Medicaid eligibility for an individual \nwhile in prison, and 42 states had a policy to suspend eligibility for an eligible \nperson while in jail. Six additional states are considering what this bill provides \nwhich is to suspend rather than terminate Medicaid for a person who is sent to \nprison. \n \nOne of the most significant numbers shows we terminate Medicaid while an \nindividual is in prison. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 27, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nhas worked closely with our jails in the State. We have been able to provide \nassistance for individuals to sign up for Medicaid upon release from jail but have \nnot had the same success for individuals in prison. \n \nWhen an individual in prison on medication is released, we are using State funds \nto cover his or her prescription costs upon release. Richard Whitley has provided \nus  with  information  showing  $56,000  in  cash  payments  paid  for  a \n30-day supply of prescriptions for individuals upon their release. \n \nThis bill will help keep our community safe. We have people being released from \nour prisons. Having access and continuity of mental and physical health care \nupon release will make them more successful as they enter back into society. \n \nRICHARD R. WHITLEY, M.S. (Director, Department of Health and Human Services): \nA corrections outreach dashboard (Exhibit B) is a statement showing how many \npeople, by prison, are discharged each month, and how many are enrolled in \nMedicaid.  This  information  current  to  March  of  2021  shows  zero  people \nenrolled. The DHHS has tried to come up with strategies that may work better \noutside the Department of Corrections (DOC) by offering computers that could \nbe accessed and applications submitted for Medicaid; so far, we have not been \nsuccessful. We have offered to complete enrollment by sending staff as we do \nin  the  jails.  When  people  leave  jail,  we  see  police  interacting  with  these \nindividuals, so we have the experience of real-time impact. \n \nThis is important work, and DHHS supports the bill. People in corrections are \nassessed for medical and mental health conditions, treated while incarcerated \nand  given  30  days  of  medication  upon  release.  This  dashboard  is  a  good \nframework for us to continue to monitor this information as we individually \nenroll. If the bill for the all-payer claims database passes, we can show what \nhealth care people access and what the outcomes are.  \n \nWe are in a request-for-proposal process for managed care. With the expansion \nof Medicaid, Clark and Washoe Counties are primarily managed care for the \nnewly eligible individuals, and most inmates released will be newly eligible. We \nhave added an incentive in the request for proposal to score more points on \nhow people would deal with the criminal justice-involved population. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 27, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nIs there any way to ensure individuals in solitary confinement can access mental \nhealth  treatment  and  Medicaid?  Data  shows  that  when  an  individual  is  in \nsolitary confinement for any more than three days, it is like going into combat \nand people end up with post-traumatic stress disorder. If individuals are released \nafter 60 days in solitary confinement, we have a problem.  \n \nMR. WHITLEY: \nThis bill has the potential to be incremental policy-making in that several states, \nUtah the most recent, have applied for a waiver from the Centers for Medicare \n& Medicaid Services to allow for Medicaid to be implemented 30 days prior to \nrelease so there is an overlap while the inmate is incarcerated. That will drive \nthe standards of care to cross over to the community. The dashboard has the \npotential for us to catch up on both ends with people treated in the community \nwho end up incarcerated and then released. \n \nHAROLD WICKHAM (Deputy Director Programs, Department of Corrections): \nOur seriously mentally ill offenders are no longer held in Ely State Prison. We \nhave  moved  them  to  the  Northern  Nevada  Correctional  Center  where  they \nreceive care and treatment in a mental health facility. \n \nThe  DOC  is  encouraged  by  A.B.  358  as  it  will  meet  the  needs  and  assist \noffenders in successfully returning to the community while creating a better \ncontinuity of care. \n \nWe  do  not  have  solitary  confinement;  we  use  what  is  called  disciplinary \nsegregation,  which  removes  offenders  from  the  general  population  for \ndisciplinary or administrative issues such as having an issue with or facing an \nattack by another offender. Our severely mentally ill patients are all transported \nto a facility at the Northern Nevada Correctional Center. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nYou  say  segregation  is  not  solitary  confinement.  When  they  are  moved  to \nsegregation, how many days are they there and what kind of mental health \ntreatment is available to them? Senate Bill (S.B.) 187 would have required those \ntypes of things, but the fiscal note on this bill was so large it did not pass. I was \ntold they could not do all of the mental health things included in the bill. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 27, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nSENATE BILL 187: Makes various changes relating to the solitary confinement \nof offenders. (BDR 16-170) \n \nMR. WICKHAM: \nThe maximum for segregation is limited to 60 days.  \n \nDoctor David Greene oversees our mental health treatment in the mental health \nfacilities. \n \nWe  submitted  a  fiscal  note  for  A.B.  358  for  staff  to  help  process  the \napplications. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nWho provides the mental health services? \n \nMR. WICKHAM: \nOur mental health services are provided by in-house and contract providers. We \nhave  mental  health  professionals,  psychologists,  psychiatrists  and \nDOC employees. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe Division of Welfare and Supportive Services previously had staff located in \nsome of the correctional facilities, which has not worked out well. Will this bill \ntransfer eligibility services to DOC staff? \n \nMR. WHITLEY: \nThe bill facilitates the application process for the inmate. We will still determine \neligibility at the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWould the staff at DOC be used to help out with collecting documentation or \nother information for the inmate? \n \nMR. WHITLEY: \nYes. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 27, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe have a Senate bill with similar components sponsored by Senator Hardy and \nSenator Settelmeyer. I want to make sure there is no conflict between these \ntwo bills. \n \nMR. WHITLEY: \nI  am  not  aware  of  any  conflict  between  the  two  bills.  The  two  actions  in \nA.B. 358 are for suspending Medicaid eligibility. The majority of inmates have \nnot been enrolled in Medicaid. The focus on suspension is consistent with this \nbill. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe bill you are referencing is S.B. 93, dealing with the suspension rather than \ntermination of Medicaid for ease of continuing after release rather than having \nto reapply. \n \nSENATE  BILL  93  (1st  Reprint):  Revises  provisions  relating  to  Medicaid. \n(BDR 38-193) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN NGUYEN: \nI was familiar with S.B. 93 and have made sure the bills were compatible and \nthere was no conflict. \n \nSARAH ADLER (National Alliance on Mental Illness Nevada): \nWe also testified in support of S.B. 93 and are in support of A.B. 358. I am the \nformer President of the National Alliance on Mental Illness Western Nevada, and \nwe have had interactions with Northern Nevada Correctional Center and had \nmultiple connections with peer support groups under the previous warden. As \nrelated to A.B. 358, the point is that we have worked with inmates, removed \nstigma and helped them understand they have a mental illness and that perhaps \nmedication is necessary to achieve stability and recovery in their lives.  \n \nWe have the ability for inmates to retain stability and support recovery so they \ndo not return to an institution if we can enroll inmates in Medicaid before they \nleave the prison system where they have been able to access a diagnosis and \nmedication. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 27, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nNICHOLAS SHEPACK (American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada): \nEnsuring we have continuity of care from prison to reentering the community is \nimperative. I have the pleasure of interacting with directly impacted individuals \nwho have spent long periods of time in segregation or solitary confinement. I \nhave worked with multiple individuals who have spent over 2 decades in solitary \nconfinement and were released rapidly into society; and some who have spent \nover 40 years in prison. They are released and expected to navigate a Medicaid \nsystem in a world they did not know existed. They are using computers for the \nfirst time; nothing is the same as when they went to prison. \n \nI have seen individuals with major health issues, a sickness, an accident or \nmental health breakdown that led to emergency room care before they were \nable to access Medicaid. This is expensive and confusing for them, and they do \nnot receive the necessary follow-up care. \n \nBy  ensuring  we  have  individuals  signed  up  for  Medicaid,  we  can  avoid  the \nissues of being released from prison after decades. Any barrier we can lift will \nbenefit  those  who  have  been  incarcerated  and  the  communities  they  are \nreleased into. \n \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union of Nevada supports A.B. 358. \n \nMARIA-TERESA LIEBERMAN-PARRAGA (Battle Born Progress): \nBattle Born Progress supports A.B. 358. For many, Medicaid is the only way \nthey can get health care, especially for those who find themselves in prison. \nMany  are  likely  to  be  from  low-income  or  underserved  communities  that \ndesperately depend on Medicaid for health care. This program is essential to \nensure they can access healthcare coverage.  \n \nOnce people have served their time, they should be given the opportunity to \nturn their lives around, and that includes access to health care. Terminating their \neligibility  to  receive  Medicaid  is  a  needlessly  cruel  punishment  that  extends \nbeyond their sentences, setting them up for failure when they return to the \ncommunity. As a State, we should be working to expand access to health care \nfor everyone to create a healthier society. \n \nJOHN PIRO (Clark County Public Defender’s Office): \nContinuity of care is most important. The Clark County Office of the Public \nDefender supported S.B. 93 and also supports A.B. 358. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 27, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nKENDRA BERTSCHY (Washoe County Public Defender's Office): \nI also testified on behalf of S.B. 93 and urge your support for A.B. 358. This is \ngood policy that will ensure people have quicker access to inpatient treatment \ncenters  upon  release.  Unfortunately,  we  see  people  committing  additional \noffenses due to the lack of continuity of care. \n \nJIM HOFFMAN (Nevada Attorneys for Criminal Justice): \nI echo the comments of the previous testifiers. Nevada Attorneys for Criminal \nJustice supports A.B. 358. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 358. I will entertain a motion on A.B. 358. \n \n  SENATOR KIECKHEFER MOVED TO DO PASS A.B. 358. \n \n  SENATOR HARRIS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \n  THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * *   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 27, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSeeing no public comment, the meeting is adjourned at 4:14 p.m. \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nVickie Polzien, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 27, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nExhibit  Begins \nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \nLetter  on Page \n  A  1    Agenda \nMr. Richard Whitley / \n  B  1  Department of Health  DWSS Corrections Outreach  \nand Human Services \n ", "47": "\nMINUTES OF THE  \nSENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n \nEighty-first Session \nFebruary 18, 2021 \n \n \nThe Senate Committee on Health and Human Services was called to order by \nChair Julia Ratti  at  4:00 p.m.  on  Thursday,  February 18,  2021,  Online. \nExhibit A is the Agenda.

(BDR 38-6) \n \nSENATOR PAT SPEARMAN (Senatorial District 1): \nI am presenting S.B. 123 relating to the Nevada Silver Haired Legislative Forum. \nI will provide you with background information about the Forum (Exhibit B) and \nthe proposed conceptual amendments in this bill (Exhibit C). \n \nThe proposed changes to S.B. 123 expand the qualifications relating to the \nmembership of the Forum. Section 1 of the bill provides flexibility to appoint \nindividuals to the Forum by changing residency requirements from five years to \none year for all nominees or six months for nominees who are military members.\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 18, 2021 \nPage 2 \n \nSection 1 also reduces the residency requirement in the Senatorial District from \n3  years  to  30 days.  Section  2  of  the  bill  would  include  the  same  changes \nregarding ex officio members of the Forum. \n \nSenate Bill 123 came about because I wanted to nominate a person to the \nNevada  Silver  Haired  Legislative  Forum.  The  person  had  over  30  years  of \nexperience in business and industry but had not been in Nevada for 3 years; she \nwas told she could not serve. I could not understand why those qualifications \nexisted. People who want to serve are over 60 years old, retired and want to \ngive back to their community. I do not understand why we make them wait \nfive years to qualify; it does not make sense. The residency requirements in the \nproposed amendments mirror those for offices in Nevada.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI have been involved with appointing people to the Forum for some time now. I \nfind institutional knowledge has advantages for Nevada and what our State is \ndoing. Losing institutional knowledge is bad. I wonder if the bill's sponsor would \nbe  interested  in  limiting  the  number  of  Forum  members  who  do  not  have \ninstitutional knowledge to no more than one-third under the six-month residency \nrequirement in the proposed amendment. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI am not sure I want to do that because we have people who are willing to \nserve. You can talk about institutional knowledge; however, I was not born here \nor did not grow up here. There are so many things I learned about Nevada while \nliving here, and it did not take five years. If you have another explanation, I may \nconsider it. I understand institutional knowledge, and maybe there are things we \ncan do to ensure the makeup of the Forum as members come and go. The same \nthing occurs in the Legislature with term limits. As Senators term out, there are \nnew Senators who come on board with no institutional knowledge and I think \nwe do well. I do not want to disqualify anyone who is otherwise qualified from \nserving. I am willing to consider changes, and we can talk about it. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nOur Senatorial Districts can be very different. Some are stable, where residents \nhave lived there for years; other districts have a high turnover rate of residency. \n   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 18, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nSomehow  naturally,  we  are  going  to  get  a  mix  of  people  and  diverse \nrepresentation because we have a diversity of districts within our State. \n \nThe hearing on S.B. 123 is now closed.

I will share a video about responses to a mental health crisis. \n \nI am excited to bring forward a group of bills that will help the State of Nevada \ntake steps to rebuild our crisis response system and address the needs of a \nperson in a behavioral health crisis. As the video alluded, a person will call \n911 and the operator will dispatch police, fire or medical personnel. For many \nfamilies  or  an  individual  experiencing  a  behavioral  health  crisis,  the  person \ncalling does not fit into one of these categories. Starting with work done in \nMaricopa County in Arizona and in other states across the Nation such Colorado \nand Oregon, we have begun to adopt and build a specific system designed to \naddress behavioral health.  \n \nThis has significant overlap between the criminal and social justice reform work \nwe have been tackling as a State, as well as the appropriate behavioral health \nresponse. When we roll law enforcement to every, or many behavioral health \ncrises, the person may need a behavioral health professional or peer specifically \ntrained to help. We are asking police to do what they were never designed to \ndo. Rather than continuing down this path, we seek to partner with and train \nlaw  enforcement,  building  an  appropriate  behavioral  health  response  that \npartners  with  law  enforcement  but  whenever  possible  does  not  include  law \nenforcement. \n \nFor many people experiencing a behavioral health crisis, interaction with law \nenforcement can often be retraumatizing. It is a significant shift in how we think \nabout responding to a behavioral health crisis with four critical elements I will \nreview on the following presentation (Exhibit F). \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 2, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nThe model built in Phoenix, Arizona, was picked up by Substance Abuse and \nMental Health Services Administration at the national level and is now being \ndistributed as a national best practice. That model has four critical components, \nthe first being a High Tech Crisis Call Center. I will bring forward another bill \nsponsored by the Health and Human Services Committee that will specifically \ntalk about the work happening around  988, the  National Suicide Prevention \nHotline, and centralizing behavioral health crises into a separate system with \nthis  High  Tech  Crisis  Call  Center.  Ninety  percent  of  those  experiencing  a \nbehavioral health crisis in the best practice models are able to be stabilized over \nthe phone through these call centers. The centers have specialists who do air \ntraffic control and are critically important as they know where there may be a \nmobile crisis team and where a bed may be available in an outpatient treatment \nprogram. We immediately lean into the case management necessary to support \nthat person in the immediate crisis and with any follow-up care. \n \nNext is the 24/7 Mobile Crisis unit for the 10 percent of callers who cannot be \nstabilized over the phone. These teams typically are comprised of a behavioral \nhealth specialist and a  peer.  This is why, to the prior  bill S.B. 69, we are \nspending the time and attention necessary to ensure we are developing our peer \nworkforce since this model is highly dependent on having those peers as part of \nthe response. Someone with lived experience along with a behavioral health \nprofessional can be dispatched by the air traffic control system to meet people \nin the hospital emergency room, on a street corner or in the family’s home or \nwherever necessary to help stabilize that crisis.  \n \nSenate  Bill  156  specifically  addresses  the  crisis  stabilization  center.  Last \nSession, the Washoe County Behavioral Health Policy Board brought forward a \nbill to do licensing for crisis stabilization centers in an effort to help build this \nmodel. We learned the language we put together was too narrow by limiting \ncrisis  stabilization  centers  to  psychiatric  hospitals  only,  which  was  not  an \nappropriate approach. This bill seeks to expand the number of agencies that can \nbe considered and pursue endorsements to become crisis stabilization centers. \nAlong with that would be a model to bill Medicaid for those services so we can \nbuild the financial model allowing these crisis stabilization programs to become \na reality. \n \nThat is the meat of this particular bill. It is important the crisis stabilization and \nall of the components of the crisis stabilization program have these essential \nprinciples and practices. These principles include an orientation to recovery, skill \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 2, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nand training in trauma informed care, significant use of peer staff, commitment \nto zero suicide and suicide safer care principles, safety to consumer and staff, \nand  collaboration  with  law  enforcement  so  these  components  get  woven \nthrough the entire system of care. \n \nIn Phoenix, it took 13 years to build this system. We hope to accelerate that; \nhowever, there has been a solid two years of ground work laid by Leadership \nand the Department of Health and Human Services working with the regional \nbehavioral health policy boards. I was invited to Phoenix to see their program in \npractice which sold me on the fact this is the direction we need to move as a \nState. The best outcomes will be for patients getting better immediate care and \nmore positive behavioral health crisis response.  \n \nLong-term  savings  could  potentially  benefit  both  local  governments  and  the \nState. This would give the ability to redirect the significant amount of resources \nlaw enforcement agencies are spending now toward behavioral health crises \nback toward public safety and keeping people out of local hospital rooms, which \nis not good for the patient or our budget. \n \nDUANE  YOUNG  (Deputy  Administrator,  Division  of  Health  Care  Financing  and \nPolicy, Department of Health and Human Services): \nThe goal of S.B. 156 is to modify the positions of Assembly Bill No. 66 of the \n80th Session. The removal of the 16-bed requirement would assist in allowing \ncurrent psychiatric facilities to overcome the burden of creating a hospital within \na hospital. Expanding this to acute hospitals will allow them to be endorsed and \nreimbursed, providing a higher standard of care to individuals already presenting \nin  an  emergency  room,  and  these  cases  would  be  triaged  to  the  most \nappropriate level of care. \n \nThe Division of Health Care Financing and Policy (DHCFP) met with multiple \nfacilities and hospitals willing to participate in models such as Crisis Now and \nEmPath if these restrictions are removed, allowing for greater flexibility and a \nreimbursement mechanism for Medicaid higher than the observation codes. This \nwould allow facilities to provide higher standards of care and recruit and retain \nmore professionals in behavioral health.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 2, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nSTEPHANIE WOODARD, PSY.D. (Senior Advisor, Division of Public and Behavioral \nHealth, Department of Health and Human Services): \nSeveral years ago, the National Association of State Mental Health Program \nDirectors issued a number of policy briefs looking at the need to move beyond \nbeds. The majority of individuals in a behavioral health crisis will, more often \nthan not, end up in an emergency room where they may or may not end up with \nspecialty  psychiatric  care.  Oftentimes,  they  wait  hours,  if  not  days,  for  an \nappropriate placement and may not receive a comprehensive evaluation to help \ndetermine what level of care they need and match them with the appropriate \nservices.  \n \nThe living room model is a completely different paradigm. We are talking about \na large room enabling people to be actively engaged and one of the reasons the \ninfusion of peers is vitally important. We work with individuals where they are in \nrelation  to  their  crisis,  actively  engaging  them  in  problem  solving  and \nde-escalation. We recognize the need for safety if an individual needs additional \nsupport or access to a bed and see this as one of the reasons hospitals need to \nbe able to do this. \n \nLiving room models are considered warm and welcoming. There are no staff \nbehind plexiglass windows. The models are designed to invite individuals to \nengage with treatment providers and peers in meaningful interactions.  \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nAn important concept of this is a subacute model and is traditionally meant to \nlast 24 hours or less. If people cannot be stabilized in that period of time, the \nnext step would be to put them in an appropriate level of care in an inpatient \nfacility. If they can be stabilized, it ensures they are discharged with a good \ncase management plan, with outpatient care and appropriate medications. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nDo you anticipate some of these programs would be built within our existing \nacute care facilities? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nWith  the  16-bed  requirement,  it  was  not  advantageous  for  hospitals  and \npsychiatric facilities because it is expensive to run a separate 16-bed facility. \nStriking the language as it is in the bill and allowing acute hospitals would \nprovide  a  separate  area  within  the  hospital  without  restraints  from  the  bed \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 2, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \ncount, which would be more flexible for staffing. It would be an area within the \nhospital. Both the EmPath model and Crisis Now look at separate areas that are \nmore  comfortable  and  conducive  to  an  environment  of  recovery  within  the \nfacility.  Someone  would  be  moved  out  the  emergency  room  into  this  area, \ntriaged appropriately within the first 24 hours, and given an appropriate level of \ncare or plan of safe discharge to return home. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIf someone is on a Legal 2000 hold, is that person eligible for placement in a \ncrisis stabilization center? \n \nMS. WOODARD: \nIt is possible. We would expect that a number of individuals presenting for care \nin a crisis stabilization unit or center would already be initiated on a Legal 2000 \nhold. We have found the vast majority of individuals coming in on legal holds do \nnot meet criteria where this is in place. A thorough evaluation can determine if \nan individual does meet criteria for a legal hold, and the center staff can do the \ntransfer  of  care  whether  in  their  hospital  or  a  hospital  within  their  region, \nensuring the individual is placed most appropriately depending upon the need. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nAre  there  security  requirements  around  withholding  someone  under  legal \ncustody? \n \nMS. WOODARD: \nThis is one of the reasons we want our crisis stabilization units or centers to be \nin  existing  hospitals.  They  must  meet  a  number  of  safety  and  security \nmeasures, including antiligature for the ability to do seclusion and restraint if \nnecessary. In hospitals or crisis stabilization centers that have used this model, \nthe need for seclusion and restraint is very little. Much of this has to do with \nnot only the philosophy behind the care provided, but the way the staff are \ntrained to engage with individuals in crisis. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThe  important  piece  to  making  this  successful  is  the  ability  to  say  yes  to \neveryone. Whether it is a Legal 2000 hold, a substance use withdrawal issue or \nany other type of mental health issue, if law enforcement or a mobile crisis team \nhas brought these individuals to the door, the idea is that it is a very quick \nturnaround.  This  lets  law  enforcement  get  back  to  their  job,  and  the  crisis \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 2, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nstabilization center is set up to address any concern. Over time, you can train \nlaw enforcement to say yes. Other communities have learned you cannot say \nyes to everyone so individuals are not taken to these crisis stabilization centers. \nWhen we start making that decision, we lose the efficacy of the program. They \nhave  the  capabilities  built  in  and  therefore  a  higher  reimbursement  rate. \nCommunities have also found they are spending less money on individuals than \nthose sitting in an emergency room. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWe are talking about allowing places such as the Mallory Behavioral Health \nCrisis Center in Carson City to be built within the walls of a larger hospital, is \nthat correct? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nIt could be built within in the walls of a larger hospital but would not have to be, \nas long as a center can meet the licensing criteria. \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nThe Mallory Behavioral Health Crisis Center is one of the reasons we asked to \nbring forth this type of legislation because it did not fit in the existing language. \nThis would allow a center to receive the Medicaid reimbursement. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIs the Mallory Behavioral Health Crisis Center too large, with too many beds? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nNo, as it is considered licensed as an acute care hospital, not a free standing \npsychiatric hospital, it did not qualify. The removal of that language will allow a \ncenter to qualify to perform these services even though the staff are performing \nthem without a proper reimbursement. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThe first version of this bill limited it to psychiatric hospitals. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nHow does this affect, for instance, WestCare. Is that model still allowed under \nthis bill, or does it need to be a hospital, separate and distinct? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 2, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nAs for WestCare, or what is created in the Nevada Revised Statutes as a crisis \ntriage  center,  it  is  not  eliminated.  The  crisis  triage  centers  have  evolved \ndifferently than anyone had anticipated and have perhaps evolved differently in \nClark County than they have in Washoe County. They do not meet the full need \nof a robust behavioral health crisis stabilization, so we believe this bill is needed \nin addition to what is happening in care, treatment and services standards. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nHomelessness often co-occurs with a mental disorder. Do these stabilization \ncenters need to offer services for those who are homeless and experiencing \nmental health crises? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThe  experience  of  other  communities  has  been  that  individuals  experiencing \nhomelessness  also  experience  behavioral  health  crises.  If  you  have  a  more \nappropriate behavioral health response, you have a higher likelihood of helping \nthat individual move away from homelessness and into a more stable situation. \nHowever,  not  every  individual  experiencing  homelessness  coming  through  a \ncrisis  stabilization  will  get  housed.  Their  behavioral  health  crises  will  be \nstabilized. Due to the high tech, high touch air traffic control system and ability \nto connect them back to their case managers and case management programs \nembedded into the system, there will be a significant effort to attempt to get \nthem housed. We cannot guarantee everyone getting a crisis stabilized will be \nready and willing to go into housing. It does dramatically increase the odds this \nmay happen. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nIf officers respond, is there any way to be sure they will take individuals to a \ncrisis  stabilization  center  versus  jail?  Someone  may  be  combative  and  has \nassaulted an officer and is taken to jail. Is there some way to ensure when being \npicked up by an officer the person will end up at one of these centers? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nAnother  bill  is  coming  forward  where  we  can  dig  a  little  deeper  into  your \nquestion,  which  is  the  988  National  Suicide  Prevention  Hotline.  What  is \nimportant for the crisis stabilization system is there is a strong partnership with \nlaw enforcement. A big part of that is working with dispatch and ensuring the \nappropriate dispatch is happening for every situation. There will be times when \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 2, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nsomeone experiencing a behavioral health crisis is putting self or others in such \na level of danger a public safety response is appropriate. There will be other \nsituations where law enforcement will never be dispatched because there is not \na public safety issue. I cannot say there is a once-size-fits-all or guarantee. \nWhere the model works is when you dispatch the right response for what is \nhappening. This is where the learning we need to do with law enforcement, \ndispatch  and  behavioral  health  professionals  ensures  we  are  getting  the \nappropriate care to the individual. \n \nROBIN REEDY (National Alliance on Mental Illness Nevada): \nThe National Alliance on Mental Illness supports S.B. 156 and the idea of Crisis \nNow throughout our Nation and in Nevada.  \n \nCHRISTOPHER ROSE (Valley Health System Acute Care Hospitals Nevada): \nWhile we appreciate the work done on A.B. No. 66 of the 80th Session, it did \nlimit  the  kind  of  hospitals  that  could  provide  crisis  stabilization  services. \nSenate Bill 156 rectifies that unintended consequence. Valley Health Systems \nsupports S.B. 156. \n \nTARYN HIATT (American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, Nevada Chapter): \nTo see crisis services be improved and implement access to care, specifically \nsuicide safe care, we know this bill will save lives. The Nevada Chapter of the \nAmerican Foundation for Suicide Prevention supports S.B. 156. \n \nMARY WALKER (Carson Tahoe Health): \nCarson Tahoe Health supports S.B. 156. This bill will incentivize local hospitals \nto provide crisis stabilization services and is a great way for the State to partner \nwith hospitals to provide these services. It potentially expands access to these \ncritical services throughout Nevada. \n \nJOAN HALL (Nevada Rural Hospital Partners): \nNevada Rural Hospital Partners supports S.B. 156 and licensed hospitals being \nallowed an endorsement as a crisis stabilization center. We have seen other \nstates successfully use this type of service to increase access to the most \nbeneficial behavioral health care in an appropriate setting. There are several rural \nand frontier critical access hospitals in Nevada that are interested in providing \nthis type of service.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 2, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nSection 1, subsection 5, paragraph (b) of the bill requires proof the hospital is \naccredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities or the \nJoint Commission. The majority of critical access hospitals in Nevada are not \naccredited but rather licensed and certified by the Bureau of Healthcare Quality \nand Compliance of the Division of Public and Behavioral Health. We hope there \nis an opportunity to allow these hospitals to receive this endorsement if they \nmeet the requirements in this bill.  \n \nKIMBERLY BUCHHOLZ: \nI lost a brother to suicide and would appreciate having had more resources for \nhim to able to reach out. If this had been available, he might be alive today. \nBefore the crisis that took his life, he had an interaction with law enforcement, \nwas not sure how to handle the situation and passed from suicide a month \nlater.  This  is  someone  who  had  never  had  previous  interaction  with  law \nenforcement.  This  could  be  beneficial  to  our  community,  and  I  support \nS.B. 156. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThe comments made by Joan Hall regarding the accreditation at the Rural and \nFrontier hospitals is something we will look into because we want to ensure this \nmodel is available in as many Nevada communities as possible.  \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 156.  \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nI will open the hearing on S.B. 154. \n \nSENATE  BILL  154:  Makes  changed  related  to  Medicaid  coverage  of  certain \ntreatments administered at institutions for mental diseases. (BDR 38.451) \n \nSENATOR JULIA RATTI (Senatorial District No. 13): \nThis is a bill that came out of the Interim Committee on Healthcare focused on \nbehavioral health challenges. Building off the last bill we heard, S.B. 156, it will \nbe wonderful to get to a place where 90 percent of people experiencing a crisis \ncan be stabilized over the phone; another 8 percent or 9 percent stabilized by a \nmobile  crisis  team;  and  another  percentage  being  stabilized  in  a  crisis \nstabilization center. The truth of the matter is there will still be people in our \ncommunity, once stabilized, needing beds. They will need beds to pursue their \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 2, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nsubstance use or mental illness recovery, or it could be a child with a serious \nemotional disturbance.  \n \nOne of the barriers that exist in our community could be addressed if we were \nto  apply  to  Medicaid  for  a  waiver.  The  1915(i)  waiver  we  applied  for  last \nSession gave us the ability to work with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \nServices  (CMS)  to  do  some  things  around  tenancy  support  and  supportive \nhousing. This is the first step in a process allowing us to work with our federal \npartners  build  a  better  model  and  ensure  we  have  the  behavioral  health \nresources we need. \n \nI  will  review  the  Institution  for  Mental  Disease  (IMD)  Exclusion  Waiver \npresentation (Exhibit G), which explains what an IMD waiver is. This is defined \nas a facility that has 16 or more psychiatric beds, or 50 percent or more of their \nadmissions are for a behavioral health disorder. If you are an IMD, you are \nexcluded from being eligible for Medicaid reimbursement. This means if we want \nto invest in more beds in these settings, it would be a 100 percent General Fund \ncontribution. We would have to do this all with State dollars. In reality this does \nnot happen, and there is not a business model that works in our community \nallowing us to get to the number of beds required. \n \nThis exclusion from Medicaid reimbursement creates a roadblock for patients \nexperiencing these challenges. The first step to getting rid of this roadblock is \nS.B. 154. We get caught in a vicious cycle where if the Legislature has not \ndirected Medicaid to apply for a waiver, they do not have the budget authority \nneeded to move forward with that waiver. They cannot figure out how much \nprograms are going to cost without going through an extensive process with the \nCMS. The budget bill which directs them to apply for the waiver will allow for \nsome analysis to figure out if it makes sense to move forward. \n \nIn this case, this is a Medicaid waiver that does allow for Medicaid match to be \nused in these facilities. It is required to be budget neutral over the course of \nfive years.  There  are  usually  some  start-up  costs  and  upfront  investment \nrequired to get these services underway, which is a challenge. Once they are \nunderway,  we  save  money  on  the  backend  by  diverting  people  out  of \nemergency rooms and higher-expense services and facilities. \n \nThat is the nature of Medicaid waivers and generally how they work. Step one \nwould be to pass S.B. 154. Step two would be the waiver application put \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 2, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \ntogether by the DHCFP, our State Medicaid would go through the extensive \nprocess. Over 30 states have done this for substance use disorder treatment, \nand  we  are  closing  in  on  10  states that  have  pending  approval  for  serious \nmental illness and the emotionally disturbed. After we get the approval, we can \nstart implementing some of this treatment.  \n \nThe problem is there is not enough access to care for behavioral health, partially \ndue to an improper business model. The waiver to Medicaid would allow us to \napply for the IMD waiver and do it differently, proving we can make it budget \nneutral and be able to seek reimbursement for these facilities known as IMDs.  \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nIn Nevada, only two facilities in the north and one in the south qualify as not \nmeeting the IMD rule. These are all acute hospitals with inpatient psychiatric \nunits.  Fee-for-Service  Medicaid,  which  includes  seriously  and  persistently \nmentally ill individuals within the medically aged, blind and disabled populations, \nare dependent on these facilities and the two state hospitals.  \n \nOver the years, this has created a consistent bottleneck with people waiting for \ntreatment in emergency rooms and facilities. Managed care organizations have \nup to 15 days per month for crisis care for an individual in an inpatient setting in \nlieu of more expensive care. This does not account for individuals needing more \nintensive or longer-term care.  \n \nDue to the inability for Nevada to pay, we are without any clinically managed \ndetoxification programs that could treat individuals with any source of Medicaid. \nThe Substance Use Disorder Initiative seeks to supplement current Medicaid and \nChildren’s Health Insurance Program State Plan benefits by adding residential \nand withdrawal management services consistent with the American Society of \nAddiction Medicine levels 3.1, 3.5 and 3.7. These are levels missing within \nNevada’s health scope for Medicaid recipients.  \n \nAllowing the DHCFP to apply for the 1115 Demonstration Waiver gives the \nState the flexibility to provide services proving their budget neutrality over the \nfive-year life of the waiver. This can be done by adherence to the robust CMS \nmeasurements and standards of neutrality. Nevada’s unique position with the \nsupport  grant  allows  us  to  leverage  the  expertise  and  guidance  we  have \nreceived and technical assistance and planning.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 2, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nIf we are selected for the Demonstration waiver, it will allow us to utilize the \nEnhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentages to cover the administrative \ncost of waiver development and implementation of this service. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nFrom the Health and Human Services policy side, we are asking to endorse the \nneed for beds; the backlog in emergency rooms is not appropriate. There are a \nlot of fiscal questions in terms of how we get started with the waiver, and we \nsuspect this bill will be pulled into the Finance Committee where we can dig \ndeeper into how this would affect the Medicaid budget specifically.  \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nYou stated four states have this waiver, is this correct? \n \nMS. COMLOSSY: \nThere are two separate waivers. The waiver for substance use disorder services \nis up to 31 states. The waiver the DHCFP is authorized to apply for, which \nrelates to individuals with serious mental illness or severe emotional disorder, is \nup to seven states. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nSince the number of waivers the DHCFP is authorized to apply for is so low, has \nit  been  difficult  for  states  to  get  their  waivers,  or  is  CMS  denying  waiver \napplications? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nThe CMS has advised states to apply for the substance use disorder waiver first \nand then use that as a template to apply for the waiver regarding serious mental \nillness and serious emotional disturbance. This is why those numbers are higher \non the substance use disorder side. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nSo states are making their way into a blind IMD waiver? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nYes, that is correct. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 2, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nSection 1, subsection 4, paragraph (b) defines a child with a serious emotional \ndisturbance and exempts mental disorders designated as a Code V disorder in \nthe Manual. Code V disorders are already not mental disorders by definition. \nThere may be some confusion in that wording. \n \nERIC ROBBINS (Counsel): \nI will look into any revisions that may be necessary. \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nWill there be funding to ensure law enforcement is trained in recognizing a \nmental illness if called to a crisis situation? Will there be anything done so the \nfamily called will not end up planning a funeral for the person in crisis? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThis  particular  bill  is  not  about  crisis  intervention.  We  are  well  past  that \nintervention with this bill. This person has now been evaluated and offered, or \nmandated  in  some  cases,  to  be  in  a  substance  use  disorder  or  psychiatric \ntreatment facility and in an inpatient bed. With this bill we are several steps past \nthe call to a law enforcement officer and crisis stabilization. \n \nSenate Bill 156 is about rebuilding the crisis stabilization system. While there is \nnot explicitly money for training law enforcement in that bill, it seeks to not \nhave law enforcement respond at all. Where you reduce the interaction between \nlaw enforcement and a person experiencing a behavioral health crisis, you have \na behavior health professional and peer with lived experience sent out to handle \nthe crisis. There will be another bill presented introducing the crisis call line and \nhow, who and where we dispatch the calls.  \n \nTo answer your question, there is no funding in this or any other bills we heard \ntoday specifically directed at training for law enforcement, but overall, multiple \nbills are working on dramatic improvements to crisis response. In most cases, \nwe are trying not to send out law enforcement and ensuring when we do send \nlaw enforcement, we have a better outcome. \n \nALLISON  ZEDNICEK,  CEO  (Desert  Parkway  Behavioral  Healthcare  Hospital,  Las \nVegas, Reno Behavioral Healthcare Hospital): \nI support S.B. 154. This bill would increase access exponentially, especially in \nthe north where it is limited. When I am working with our hospital CEOs and \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 2, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \ndirectors of the emergency rooms, the majority of patients remaining are waiting \nfor state beds and on Medicaid. There is a gap in services since we are not able \nto treat patients and be compensated for Medicaid, often acquiring quite a bit of \ncharity when we  have patients with Medicaid.  We are also 30 percent less \ncostly  than  the  short-term  acute  hospitals.  In  the  long  run,  the  IMD  would \ncreate a cost savings.  \n \nThis would also help bypass the emergency rooms creating a direct relationship \nwith mobile crisis, metro police officers and all agencies in the north responding \nto crises in the communities. Our full intention would be to partner and bypass \nthe emergency room with individuals coming directly to us. It allows a more \nprogressive way of thinking as explained by Mr. Young and Dr. Woodard with \nregard to having additional funding available. \n \nMS. REEDY: \nThe National Alliance on Mental Illness supports S.B. 154. I will read from my \nwritten testimony (Exhibit H). \n \nLEA CASE (Nevada Psychiatric Association): \nI echo the comments from the two previous speakers and support S.B. 154. \n \nSTEVEN COHEN: \nI echo the comments from previous speakers and support S.B. 154. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nI would like to express gratitude to the Nevada Psychiatric Association who \nadvocated for this bill at the Washoe Regional Behavioral Health Policy Board \nwith the Interim Committee on Health Care.

(BDR 40-416) \n \nSARA CHOLHAGIAN (Executive Director, Patient Protection Commission): \nI will provide you with an overview of the Patient Protection Commission, their \nwork,  the  process  and  how  these  measures  came  about  (Exhibit  B).  The \nCommission was created by S.B. No. 544 of the 80th Session, sponsored by \nthe Governor, and received unanimous bipartisan support. \n \nThe Commission is comprised of healthcare experts, advocates, providers and \nindustry  professionals  who  systematically  review  issues  related  to  the \nhealthcare  needs  of  State  residents  including  quality,  accessibility  and \naffordability,  and  prescription  drugs.  The  Commission  also  makes \nrecommendations to the Governor and Legislature to improve health care for all \nNevadans. \n \nThe goal of S.B. 5 is to enact legislation to codify telehealth flexibilities granted \nduring  the  Covid-19  public  health  emergency,  specifically  aimed  to  increase \npatient access to high-quality care while reducing costs and improving patient \nand provider safety through the inclusion of clear, effective and sustainable \ntelemedicine language in the Nevada Revised Statutes. \n \nThe  request  expands  service  by  establishing  all-payer  parity,  requiring  a \nthird-party  payer  to  cover  services  provided  through  telehealth  in  the  same \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \namount as services provided in person, except for services using a standard \ntelephone.  It  also  requires  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services \n(DHHS) to establish a data dashboard allowing for analysis of data relating to \naccess to telehealth. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIs a cellular telephone considered a standard telephone? \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nIt does. I would like DuAne Young to specifically respond to the question. \n \nDUANE  YOUNG  (Deputy  Administrator,  Division  of  Health  Care  Financing  and \nPolicy, Department of Health and Human Services): \nThis language is in standard Nevada Revised Statutes, and it does apply to both \nlandline and cellular devices. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe provision of telehealth will include services provided through a standard \ntelephone, but they can be billed differently. Is this correct? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nYes.  The  telephone  is  restricted  by  the  federal  government  because  it  is  a \nnon-HIPPA compliant platform. This federal regulation is governed by the Office \nof  Civil  Rights  within  the  Department  of  Justice.  Language  in  the  Nevada \nRevised Statutes (NRS) 422 states \"to the extent applicable\" which gives S.B. 5 \nthe  authority  to  allow  telephone  if  it  were  to  be  allowed  by  the  federal \ngovernment \"to the extent applicable.\" It also sets up the Division of Health \nCare Financing and Policy (DHCFP) for the discretion to not pay parity. Nevada \nRevised Statute 422 requires parity for in-person services in telehealth; this \nwould allow us to set up a separate modifier for telephone delivered services, \nand we could pay them at a different rate than what we have paid traditional \ntelehealth or in-person visits. \n \nI serve as part of the Western States Pact for the Governor's Office, and a \nportion of this language is something other states have done. When they face a \nbudget shortfall or crisis, they do not have to cut rates across the board. They \ncan set payments from those services delivered via telephone versus those by \ntelephone  only,  particularly  when  they  are  dealing  with  providers  who  are \ncost-based reimbursed. The challenges of buying telehealth equipment or setting \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nup shop for in-person visits are taken into consideration and billing those rates \nas opposed to making a telephone call. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIf I am using a software application on my telephone, am I using a telephone or \nam I using a technology service in the broader definition of telehealth? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nThis is the modality, so if this is a standard telehealth visit, there are audiovisual \nrequirements. If it is telephone, there is a certain audio requirement. There are \napps  utilizing  remote  patient  monitoring  codes.  Those  are  different  current \nprocedural terminology (CPT) codes which are billed usually in conjunction with \nanother visit. Nevada does not currently cover those codes. Usually working \nthrough a health app is not part of the reimbursement process in working with a \nphysician. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThere is some discussion about the types of definitions allowed, provided by \nsynchronous  or  asynchronous  technology.  Is  it  your  belief  the  definition  is \ncovered under our existing statute? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nYes, it is covered under NRS 422, the section governing Nevada Medicaid. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nWho  would  be  able  to  access  this  all-payer  system?  Is  the  information \naggregated and who has the ability to pull information? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThere is some confusion between the two bills we are hearing today because \nboth bills have a data collection component. The claims database is actually in \nanother bill that will be discussed later today. I understand why there might be \nconfusion.  Senate  Bill  5  also  has  some  data  collection  components. \nMs. Cholhagian, could you please provide clarification? \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nSenate Bill 5 is not a data collection bill but mirrors a similar bill we will hear \ntoday. Senate Bill 5 puts the burden on the State to utilize the best resources of \ndata collection efforts done within the State. There is no burden on any payers \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nor insurance to submit data for the dashboard. The intent is for the State to \nutilize existing information to create the dashboard. The idea behind it was you \ncannot improve what you cannot measure. When you look at health and want \nto  address  equitable  access  for  patients  in  our  State,  you  want  to  have \nmeasurement of the data. The creation of the data dashboard is the first step to \nmeasure  telehealth  access  to  address  equitable  access  and  start  looking  at \nvulnerable populations. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nAm I understanding correctly that whoever is the administrator of the dashboard \nonly would have access to the data itself; the rest would be publicly available in \nthe dashboard. \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nYes. Sections 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 of this bill establish the parameters for the \nDHHS to create this data dashboard. There is a requirement it get posted on the \nagency website as well as the Commission website. If you are familiar with data \ndashboards the State has produced related to Covid-19, it is very similar. The \nagency is going to create a data dashboard which will be housed on the DHHS \nwebsite as well as the Commission's website so consumers can see and access \nthe  data;  however,  it  is  created  by  DHHS.  There  is  no  data  released  or \nrequested in this bill as it is only about the creation of the data dashboard. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nWill it be DHHS who will put into place all of the protections around the data? \nWhen we get personalized data, we want to see how the data is allowed to be \nused and who can control it. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThis bill does not contemplate any new data collection. It only uses data the \nState already has, for example, Medicaid claims covered by HIPAA and all the \nrules for Medicaid, or the number of individuals who are receiving respite care. It \nis only the data the State already owns. An effort is being made by DHHS to \ncreate a data unit by pooling all the statistician data people into one unit. \n \nThe bill asks we take all the data and put it into a dashboard which makes data \nunderstandable to the general public and all of us. It is less about new data. \nWhatever protections are currently in place for the data still stand, and this bill \ndoes not do anything about that. The next bill we will be hearing does have a \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nlot of questions about data because it is new data. This bill is about taking the \ndata we currently have under existing protections and presenting it in a useful \nway. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nThis helps. I worry a bit about consumer protection, and anytime you centralize \na large amount of data, even if you already have access to it, there are some \nquestions. However, your explanation makes sense. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nMs. Cholhagian, can you speak to the nature of how this data is intended to be \npresented, I am assuming aggregated, and identified? There is nothing in the \ndashboard  that  would  have  any  individual  records  or  information  about  any \nindividual patient, is this accurate? \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nYes. Kyra Morgan from the Division of Public and Behavioral Health (DPBH) will \nlater provide testimony on the proposed amendment (Exhibit C); however, she is \navailable now to answer your specific question. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nMs. Morgan, could you talk about data the State now has and is currently \nprotected? \n \nKYRA MORGAN (Chief Biostatistician, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nThe information on the data dashboard and our amendment will be addressed in \npublic comment at the end of the hearing; however, all the data we present \nwould be aggregated. There would not be anything to identify a person on an \nindividual level. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI have similar questions regarding the creation of a data dashboard which allows \nfor the analysis of telehealth by different groups and populations which must: \n\"Allow for the user to sort data based on the race, ethnicity, ancestry, national \norigin,  color,  sex,  sexual  orientation,\"  etc.,  as  stated  in  S.B. 5,  section  1, \nsubsection 1, paragraph (a), subparagraph (2). Do we actually have data for \nindividuals which can then be disaggregated or aggregated? I am not sure how \nyou did the data collection and how you use it. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nMS. MORGAN: \nThis is actually applicable to the amendment we submitted from DBPH. It adds \nlanguage around the dashboard for us to collect and present data, contingent on \nwhat data is available and within federal regulations. It is likely the dashboard \nwill be a subset of what is essentially the big goal from the Commission, but we \nwill be able to include at an aggregate level as much information as possible.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWhat are you going to do with it?   \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nThe intent of the data dashboard is the first step to measure telehealth access, \naddress equitable access and look into vulnerable populations. It requires DHHS \nto  create  the  data  dashboard,  and  the  agency  must  utilize  it  in  the \ndecision-making process. \n \nIn  addition,  the  data  dashboard  ties  in  other  advisory  boards  in  the  State, \nincluding  the  Commission,  Commission  on  Behavioral  Health,  five  regional \nbehavioral health policy boards, as well as the Legislative Committee on Health \nCare. These entities will review the data dashboard and include it in the review \nof  their  own  policies.  It  is  looking  at  the  long-term  recovery  and  aiming  to \naddress health equity to ensure we create and have good data that is available \nand review and put it into consideration for future policy decisions, in addition \nto ensuring it is on the Commission website. The thought behind this was to \nmake sure patients and consumers would be able to easily access and review \nthe information themselves and also be able to opine on it. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIs someone else doing this, and is it working somewhere? \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nThe State of Colorado is doing this and has built an equitable dashboard using \nthe same thought process as the Commission's intent. I am not aware of any \nother state doing this. DuAne Young may be able to speak to this because as he \nmentioned earlier, we are part of the telehealth multistate collaborative. \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nYes, Colorado has done this. This did not particularly influence the decision of \nthe  Commission,  but  other  states  within  the  Western  States  Pact,  such  as \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nCalifornia, are looking at this as well. It is important to have this data centered \nin certain areas of our State where telehealth is heavily relied on, such as rural \nand urban areas which do not necessarily have the healthcare infrastructure and \nhad a difficult transition in the pandemic. Having this type of data and knowing \nhow the services are delivered will help us figure out how to more equitably \naddress grants when they are available and how to better support providers \nwho have not made and are having difficulty making the transition. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe may not know the race, gender and ethnicity of an individual patient, but \nwe  may  be  able  to  see  utilization  patterns  within  the  Medicaid  telehealth \nutilization. We may be able to overlay the data with neighborhoods where we \nhave  census  information  and  where  we  might  know  if  there  are  higher \nconcentrations of people of color, for example. This would give us not only a \npatient-by-patient piece of information but meaningful information in terms of \nequity and how we are doing in terms of access to services. We can look at \npeople who have generally not had access, such as people of color or lower \nincome neighborhoods. Is this the idea? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nYes. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nDo you have the ability in data collection to share information from certain \ncategories,  such  as  sexual  orientation  or  gender  identity,  so  it  is  not  just \none particular portion of health care and we do not have the information for \nanother? Once you collect the data with the appropriate information redacted, \ndo you have the ability to share it with other internal agencies? \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nThe intent is to share the information and have it housed on the DHHS website, \nas well as the Commission website, and for those other public bodies and the \npublic to review the dashboard. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nPolicy  will  be  directed  based  upon  that.  For  example,  if  you  can  get \none particular demographic hardest hit with Covid-19, you will direct resources \nto the community so the underlying mobilities would be addressed in the case of \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nanother  pandemic.  You  would  also  be  able  to  do  some  other  things  like \nprevention education. This is helpful information. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nRegarding the data analysis and policy recommendations, are you specifically \nasking for eight different boards to provide policy advice to you? \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nThe intent is to have them included in their review process. Whether they make \nit a priority is going to be at the discretion of each public body. We are making \nit known we intend for the data dashboard to be created and to be reviewed.  \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nMy follow-up question on the telehealth issue is related to behavioral health \nparity and whether it creates a disparity for behavioral health services in terms \nof reimbursement disparities being solely telephonic. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nCould you please clarify your question because there are two things in your \nquestion: behavioral health parity versus modality parity? \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nBehavioral health services may be fully adequate provided over a telephonic \nmeans, but then are we reducing reimbursement for a service which may be \nfully appropriate for a telephonic service? \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nThe intent of the Commission's bill was to allow for increased access through \npayment  parity  on  all-payer  parity  insurers,  but  recognizing  the  use  of  a \nstandard  telephone  may  not  warrant  the  same  type  of  payment  parity  or \nstandard of care. The Commission did not want to restrict the use of a standard \ntelephone but also recognized it does not want to change the standard of care \nin saying it is the same as in-person service. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWas there any discussion about whether this was an appropriate decision for \nmental health services as well as physical health care? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nYes, there was discussion about telehealth access particularly for behavioral \nhealth, but it was not included specifically in this measure. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI understand there is movement at the national level. We are in an uncertain \ntime  right  now  in  terms  of  reimbursement  for  telephone  only  or  voice  only \nversus a full true telehealth solution. If we wanted telephone to be fully within \nparity, we would also be saying the State would have to pay 100 percent \nbecause it is not a Medicaid reimbursement. We are waiting to see if the federal \ngovernment moves on this. You said earlier the bill is written in such a way if \nthere is movement, it would be a benefit to us and all Nevadans. Could you \nplease tell us a little bit more about this? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nYes, there are conversations at the federal level. This is a federal regulation \ngoverned  in  HIPAA  by  the  Office  of  Civil  Rights  within  the  Department  of \nJustice. During the pandemic and declaration of public emergency, the Office of \nCivil Rights made non-HIPPA compliant platforms which include telephone. They \ndecided not to enforce the prohibition on those so the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid  Services  (CMS)  provided  a  directive  this  could  be  reimbursed  and \nutilized.  The  State  then  covered  it  in  a  section  1135  waiver  of  the  Social \nSecurity Act. \n \nWe are reimbursing for telephone services with certain exceptions. Back to the \nlanguage in NRS, if the federal government were to move on this, and the \nexisting language within this law was not modified to the extent applicable, we \nwould be able to receive reimbursement or match. We interpreted this as our \nability,  if  the  federal  government  were  to  allow  this  and  we  were  to  get \nmatched,  to  certainly  continue  those  flexibilities.  If  not,  we  would  continue \noperating under NRS 422, the telehealth provisions as cited in our chapter as \nwe have been. \n \nNot changing this language gives us the discretion we have used during the \npandemic  through  our  Covid-19  memos  to  provide  further  guidance  about \nservices  which  were  and  were  not  traditionally  allowed  for  telehealth  but \ncertainly  not  appropriate  for  telephone.  We  have  done  this  with  some \nrehabilitative mental health services as well as some health services on the \nmedical  side.  We  have  provided  the  guidance  on  our  website  and \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nannouncements to providers. We do not see this bill as changing anything in our \noperation but allowing for this enhancement and allowing us to take advantage \nshould the federal government move in a different way. We would then craft \nparameters  in  permanent  policy  around  the  reimbursements  for  telephone \nservices if reimbursed by the federal government. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe federal government would have to address the HIPAA issue, and then CMS \nwould have to address the reimbursement issue. \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nCorrect. \n \nCLAUDIA DUCK TUCKER (Teladoc): \nWe  support  S.B.  5  and  I  have  provided  written  testimony  (Exhibit  D).  We \nsupport  legislation  to  codify  telehealth  flexibilities  granted  during  Covid-19 \npublic health emergency into law. The clarifications to the telehealth statutes \nwill  ensure  the  latest  innovations  in  technology  such  as  asynchronous \ncommunications  are  compliant  with  Nevada  law  to  allow  remote  patient \nmonitoring which is critical to those with diabetes and cardiovascular disease. \n \nWe encourage language which will allow for expanded access to expert medical \nsecond opinion services to the best specialist in the Country without incurring \nthe cost and inconvenience of travel. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThere  is  an  S.B.  5  amendment  request,  (Exhibit  E),  submitted  on  behalf  of \nTeladoc. It is focused on the definitions and some of the other pieces in this bill. \n \nWe understand from our legal counsel, if the definition is inclusive and we start \nlisting  things  out  of  it,  we  may  have  some  unintended  consequences. \nMs. Tucker,  why  do  you  think  the  bill  as  written  does  not  include  the \ntechnologies you are concerned about? \n \nMS. TUCKER: \nI think it is unclear to laymen, our clients, who read this, but is quite clear to me \nas  I  live  this  every  day.  Anytime  we  can  clarify  statutes  so  everyone \nunderstands it, we are all better for it. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nMr. Robbins, please speak to what you think the bill says or does in terms of \ninclusivity and clarity. \n \nERIC ROBBINS (Counsel): \nThis is mainly dealing with more of the existing language of NRS 629.515. The \ndefinition  talks  about  the  use  of  information  and  audiovisual  communication \ntechnology. I do not interpret \"and\" to mean you have to have both or it is not \ntelehealth. It can be either one; the \"and\" just means the definition of telehealth \nincludes both of those things. The store and forward technology falls within the \ndefinition.  \n \nNevada Revised Statutes 629.515 does not authorize or prohibit anyone from \nengaging in any activity depending upon whether or not it is telehealth. It does \nnot say if it is not telehealth you cannot do it. It does not say if it is telehealth \nyou can do it. All it says is if you are going to use telehealth for the purposes \nprescribed in subsection 1, you have to be licensed in this State and the boards \nare  allowed  to  regulate  beyond  that.  Basically,  the  particular  statute  and \ndefinition are not about what people are allowed to do or not allowed to do. The \none exception is if you are doing the things described in subsection 1 through \ntelehealth, you have to have a license. \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nI have our attorney, Greg Ott, on the telephone who helped me review this and \nlooked up the clarification of the intent. \n \nGREG OTT (Chief Deputy Attorney General, Office of the Attorney General): \nI  agree  with  Mr.  Robbins  and  came  to  the  same  conclusion  regarding  the \nstatute. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nYou  are  both  saying  it  is  broadly  written;  therefore,  it  can  be  inclusive  of \nanything. It really is only tied specifically to licensing. \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nYes. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nKYLE ZEBLEY (American Telemedicine Association): \nI am testifying in support of S.B. 5. I will read from my written testimony \n(Exhibit F) and offer the proposed amendments (Exhibit G) to this bill. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThere are similar concepts here. The peer-to-peer notion is not explicitly covered \nin State law and establishing the patient relationship pieces. Mr. Robbins, are \nthere any concerns about the language suggestion regarding peer-to-peer? \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nNo.  This  would  be  something  we  could  include.  It  would  not  be  legally \nproblematic, it would basically restrict the ability of the professional licensing \nboards to regulate these sort of consultations. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs  the  same  thing  true  in  terms  of  establishing  a  patient  relationship  by  a \ntelehealth visit currently requiring it be done in person? \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nIt is up to the individual boards who regulate the various healthcare professions. \nI am not sure what requirements they have, but it is up to their regulations, \nstandards and practice. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe notion of those two amendments is the Legislature dictating that versus the \nboards regulating it. \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nExactly. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nPeer-to-peer consultations happen all the time. If the peer-to-peer also have a \npatient in the middle of the peer-to-peer, can it charge the peer in the other \nstate or can the peer in the state of patient residence charge? Is it just allowing \na peer to talk to a peer? What does this proposed amendment do differently \nthan calling on the phone and talking to a specialist in Salt Lake City or in \nLos Angeles?  Does  it  mean  the  peer  in  Nevada  can  charge  the  patient's \ninsurance  or  patient  themselves?  What  about  the  conversation  a  doctor  in \nNevada has by talking to a doctor in Utah? Is this what we are talking about? \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nMR. ZEBLEY: \nThis is not in regards to reimbursement. It would just be the Legislature making \nclear it is an appropriate way to have telehealth interactions with another peer in \nanother state. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThis does not make sense. We can pick up the phone in Nevada and talk to \nsomeone at UCLA or University of Utah. Is it illegal now and we are going to \nmake it legal? \n \nMR. ZEBLEY: \nIt  would  be  making  it  explicitly  legal.  I  do  not  know  if  it  is  explicit  at  the \nmoment. I do not believe it is. \n \nCHARLIE SHEPARD (Nevada AARP): \nNevada AARP supports S.B. 5 since it will improve access to health care by \nincreasing the availability of telehealth for Nevada families who must rely on \nstandard telephones with audio only.  I  will read from my  written testimony \n(Exhibit H). \n \nJASMIN TOBON (Planned Parenthood): \nWe are in favor of S.B. 5 because making telehealth accessible through the \nstandard telephone would be a long-term investment in the health, safety and \nwell-being of Nevadans. Telehealth helps connect geographically isolated areas \nvitally important in health care, and is an essential tool in addressing the health \ndisparities for Indigenous and People of Color, rural and medically underserved \ncommunities.  The  removal  of  restrictions  and  increased  public  and  private \ncoverage  for  telehealth  due  to  Covid-19  has  allowed  providers  to  see  more \npatients  safely  and  efficiently.  This  temporary  expansion  has  provided  a \ndemonstration of what innovative, broadened access to telehealth can do. \n \nCHELSEA CAPURRO  (Health Services Coalition): \nWe oppose S.B. 5. Telehealth has great resources and we support the general \nconcept. We also support the data dashboard since it will be a great service to \nall of our members. We have concerns about the pay parity piece in this bill, \nwhich is why we are opposed. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nDALTON HOOKS (Nevada Self Insurers Association): \nWe oppose S.B. 5. We are concerned about the impact of audio only, as other \nasynchronistic modalities for the provision of medical services will have on the \nworkers compensation system. Section 7, which modifies NRS 616C.730, and \nsection  9,  which  redefines  the  definition  of  telehealth  as  contained  in \nNRS 629.515, are particularly concerning. \n \nWorkers compensation is not the same as general health insurance and the \nNevada Industrial Insurance Act represents a careful balancing of the interests \nof multiple parties including employers, insurers, third-party administrators and \ninjured workers. The initiation of a claim under the Act involves reporting a \npotential workplace injury to the employer and seeking appropriate medical care. \nThis involves assessment by a medical professional who would, of necessity, \nneed to see injuries and signs of an illness. Aside from finding a diagnosis, the \nprofessionals are charged under the Act with opining as to whether upon their \nexamination or told by the allegedly injured worker, they can \"directly connect \nthe injury or occupational disease as being job incurred.\" This is not the same as \na doctor in private practice. \n \nWe are concerned about secondary gain and fraud issues, identity verification, \nmalingering and lack of nonverbal observations. Increasing the complexity in the \nsystem and lack of adequate definition under NRS 629.515 to include which \nmodalities could be done via telehealth. For these reasons, we oppose this bill in \nits current form. \n \nTOM CLARK (Nevada Association of Health Plans): \nWe  oppose  S.B.  5.  We  do  have  some  concerns,  however.  We  recommend \ninsurers  continue  to  have  the  flexibility  to  negotiate  prices  to  keep  health \ncoverage affordable for the consumer. Services provided by telehealth must be \ncomparable to the services provided in an office visit. Insurers and providers \nmust be able to establish different reimbursement rates based on the clinical \neffectiveness  and  intensity  of  the  business.  It  is  important  to  develop \nvalue-based arrangements by focusing on health outcomes, not just the volume \nof  services  provided.  The  payment  parity  provision  is  contradictory  to \ntelehealth's cost effectiveness. If telehealth can help reduce costs by using the \nhealth  care  system  to  reduce  provider  visits,  it  is  contradictory  to  mandate \nthose services be paid at the same rate. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nDEBI REYNOLDS (Deputy Administrator, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nThe proposed amendment brought forward by DHHS allows us to collect and \nreport on the data currently available to us. The bill as written does not refer to \ndata only available to us at this time. We understood it to mean we would need \nto reach out and collect the data which is why there is such a large fiscal note \non it. The amendment as proposed would allow us to remove our fiscal note. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThis is in line with the testimony on the bill intended to collect existing data and \nshare it. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI need clarification on the amendments we are discussing, as there are several. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe Teladoc and American Telemedicine Association (ATA) amendments were \naddressed under support of S.B. 5 and questions about those amendments were \nanswered.  We  are  now  focused  on  the  amendment  from  DHHS,  and  the \nadministrators will discuss whatever data and funding are available, followed by \ninformation about the dashboard. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nIt has been made clear we are going to be using data we are already collecting, \nso there is no additional expense there. I imagine the creation of the dashboard \nitself is still going to cost something, correct? \n \nMS. MORGAN: \nWe  are  confident  with  our  current  staff  and  software  we  can  build  the \ndashboard by using existing resources. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nMs. Morgan, your colleagues testified this amendment would remove the fiscal \nnote. Is this your assessment as well? \n \nMS. MORGAN: \nCorrect. The amendment clarifies language to strengthen it and ensures we are \nnot relying on additional data collection. We would use the data and resources \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nalready available to create the dashboard, which would eliminate the fiscal note \nfrom DPBH. \n \nHELEN FOLEY (Delta Dental): \nWe support the DHHS amendment. The language to the \"extent resources and \ndata are available,\" satisfies our needs and concerns. Delta Dental does support \ntelehealth and has been working on these issues throughout the United States. \nOur initial concern was there might be intrusive questions asked of a patient \nsuch as gender identify, sexual orientation and if the patient has mental health \nproblems. We did not feel those questions were appropriate. This amendment \nonly includes data already available and reassures us over concerns we had. We \ndo not have an objection to the legislation. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThis bill has nothing to do with preventing a doctor from talking to a doctor \nsomewhere else, nor does it have anything to do with getting payment for that, \nnor does it allow or not allow a doctor from talking to another patient's family \nor a family caregiver, nor does it allow payment for the interchange because it is \nalready going on. Even though it is not specifically allowed, it is what we do \nanyway, and this bill does not change nor reimburse for this, correct? \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nCorrect. There may be questions related to one of the proposed amendments \nseeking to modify this. \n \nMR. OTT: \nYes, it is also my understanding. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe original amendment is the peer-to-peer piece in both the ATA and Teledoc \namendments, or is it just in the ATA amendment? \n \nMEGAN COMLOSSY (Analyst): \nIt is in both the ATA and Teledoc amendments. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nMr. Robbins, what is current law in terms of peer-to-peer interaction, and would \nthis amendment have an effect? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nUnder Nevada law, it is up to the individual statutes and regulations governing \nthe  different  professions.  For  physicians  in  particular,  NRS  630.047 \nsubsection 1, paragraph (b), says physicians do not have to have licenses if \nthey are consulting with or providing assistance to a Nevada licensed physician \nand they are legally qualified to practice in the state where they reside. The \nstatute does not exclusively mention telehealth,  but  where telehealth is not \nexplicitly  made  different,  we  interpret  the  same  provisions  which  apply  to \nin-person services apply to the provision of telehealth services. Consultation on \nan irregular basis for physicians is explicitly allowed by NRS 630. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe testimony from those who were seeking the amendment was they were \nlooking for it to be more explicit, but the testimony from our attorney is it is \nalready allowed. \n \nI will now close the hearing on S.B. 5. The hearing on S.B. 40 is now open. \n \nSENATE BILL 40: Provides for the collection of certain data relating to health \ncare. (BDR 40-415) \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nI will provide you with an overview of the Commission's activities and what led \nto S.B. 40, (Exhibit I). The intent of this measure seeks to enact mandated \nreporting of data to the Commission, DHHS and the Attorney General's Office \nto allow for the monitoring of the healthcare industry.  \n \nThis is another measure seeking to improve access to health care with the same \nmindset that you cannot improve what you cannot measure. This is the first \nstep to monitoring the healthcare industry and costs. Specifically, the request \ndoes five things which I will highlight for you and are specifically outlined in the \nattached Exhibit I. \n \nSection 20 of this bill requires an inventory of currently reported health data to \nbe used for analysis in costs/prices, consolidation and patient access to care. \nSection  14  requires  an  annual  report  summarizing  healthcare  quality  for \npresentation to the Governor, Legislature and Commission. Section 1 ensures \nthe Commission and DHHS have authority to request ad hoc reports.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nThe largest portion of this measure relates to the establishment of an All Payer \nClaims Database (APCD). In the last Session, Senator Spearman paved the way \nfor  this  conversation  to  happen  by  introducing  a  measure  which  sought  to \nestablish an APCD and, as a result of many conversations, is being included in \nthis  bill.  Senate  Bill  40  requires  DHHS  to  establish  an  APCD  relating  to \nhealthcare insurance claims provided in this State. Public and private insurers \nwho provide health benefits and are regulated under State law must submit data \nto the database, and certain insurers regulated by federal law may submit data \nto the database. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nThe standard for all health information will continue to be HIPAA. Who will have \naccess  to  this  database;  who  will  be  able  to  access  the  information  on  an \nindividual level; and what types of protections or parameters do we anticipate \nbeing put around access? \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nThis legislation focuses on authorizing the State to create the data dashboard \nand  establishing  regulations  to  include  the  data  collection  process  and  data \nrelease  process.  I  defer  to  Sandie  Ruybalid,  Chief  Information  Technology \nManager for the DHCFP and the guru of APCD efforts for our State. \n \nSANDIE RUYBALID (Chief Information Technology Manager, Division of Health Care \nFinancing and Policy, Department of Health and Human Services): \nTo answer the first question about security requirements, we would contract \nwith a third-party vendor. Part of the contracting process is requiring the party \nhave certifications: Health Information Trust Alliance certification which ensures \nthe party would comply with HIPAA regulations; and the National Institute of \nStandards  and  Technology  security  certification  and  requirements  which \nprotects the data we would house both in transit and stored and in release of \nthe data. As far as releasing the data, most of it would be de-identified and \naggregated. Someone would not be able to ping the database for one particular \npatient. Data released in an identified manner for research purposes would be \ngoverned  and  controlled  with  data  use  agreements  between  the  parties  to \nensure there is an agreement and liability so the data is not released improperly. \n \nMS. MORGAN: \nI would add we are already collecting all of this information on our Medicaid \npopulation. The security protocols we have in place to protect this information \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nwould be extended to this population. We also collect highly sensitive data \naround our communicable diseases, including HIV, where we have to maintain \nconfidentiality with the highest regard. We have a lot of processes in place to \nprotect  this  information.  This  would  be  an  extension  to  include  payers  not \nalready captured in some of our existing data collection mechanisms. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI have misgivings about section 5 which indicates a patient with all the other \nidentifications.  I  know  banks  are  hacked,  DETR  is  hacked  and  the  State  is \nhacked; there has not been an unhackable situation yet. This one takes an \nindividual  name,  social  security  number,  telephone  number,  medical  record \nnumber, health plan beneficiary number, license number, vehicle identification \nnumber, serial number, internet address, electronic billing, biometric identifier \nand photograph image. This is a recipe for disaster when someone hacks it. I \nhave major misgivings about this. This is more of a statement than a question. \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nI  can  tell  you  this  specific  language  was  not  included  in  the  Commission's \nrequest.  It  was  a  product  of  drafting  interpretation  and  indicating  it  was  a \nnecessary component of this measure. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThis  is  the  information  they  are  specifically  saying  cannot  be  released \nindividually and must be aggregated. This is a list of things we want to protect. \nCorrect? \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nThis is the definition of the term direct patient identifier. It is not saying the \ninformation is going to be necessarily included in the APCD. It is just saying if \nany information does wind up in the APCD, it has to be treated in a certain \nmanner under section 13. The people who have access to information are very \nlimited, especially with respect to other types of information possibly in the \ndatabase. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIf  any  of  the  information  makes  it  into  the  APCD,  are  we  protecting  the \nindividual identifying information? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nYes. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI think when we discussed it last Session, there were concerns around this as \nwell. The State of Washington has something very similar, and I know they \nhave increased security on this type of information. A lot of the information is \nredacted, so other than researching or trying to establish what the patterns are, \nI do not know if there is identifiable information on a person. Some of the \nprotections  are  in  redaction,  ensuring  when  it  is  disaggregated  there  is  no \ninformation that could identify an individual. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nTime  has  passed  since  we  looked  at  this  concept  two  years  ago. \nMs. Cholhagian, could you talk about the number of states who have APCDs \nand what is happening at the federal level around APCD? \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nI am aware of 19 states with established APCDs. There is a national effort \nunder the No Surprises Act to entice other states to create APCDs. There is also \nan  opportunity  for  federal  funding  which  is  a  noncompetitive  application \nprocess. I will defer to Ms. Ruybalid about the federal grant process she is \nmonitoring as well as what other states are doing. \n \nMS. RUYBALID: \nThere are 19 to 23 databases in existence in varying sizes. There is a lot of \ninterest at the federal level. There is a noncompetitive grant for all states to \napply. The funding would be available in October, and we intend to apply for \nthe grant. There is $2.5 million available over a period of two and one-half years \nto either improve your existing database or establish an APCD. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nCan you also talk about what data is typically collected in an APCD? \n \nMS. RUYBALID: \nAt the base level, it is claims data. What would be included in normal standard \nclaims transaction is what is included in an APCD. Some states have decided to \nhave  other  feeds  into  the  database  to  help  enrich  their  data.  At  the  very \nminimum, it is claims data. We would not find a vehicle identification number or \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nbiometric information as described in section 5. I am sure some other states \nhave done this; maybe they have connections and needs for the data. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe intent of this legislation is claims data so we are talking about a patient, \nwhat the patient's condition was, what was billed and what was paid. The point \nof this bill is for us to understand how much health care costs so we can start \nto make informed decisions about how we invest our dollars in terms of health \ncare and how we manage healthcare costs. \n \nMS. RUYBALID: \nCorrect.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nGoing back to the prior bill, S.B. 5, with the social security number, I suspect \nthey can figure out age. The comment made about age apparently is not in this? \nHave any of these 19 to 23 states ever had a data breach from their database? \n \nMS. RUYBALID: \nI am not aware of any data breaches in APCD. The nature of the data housed in \nthe  databases  is  very  important,  and  we  focus  on  security  and  privacy  of \ninformation.  There  are  strict  standards  in  place  for  the  technology  and  the \nbehavior of anyone housing the data. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWould the social security number typically be in an insurance claim? \n \nMS. RUYBALID: \nNot generally, no. We would not want to collect data which is not necessary \njust because of the risks. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIn 2011, the State Health Information Exchange talked a lot about individual \npatients'  ability  to  make  decisions  regarding  whether  they  wanted  their \ninformation uploaded into a government-run system. The way I read this bill, \nyou  cannot  have  private  insurance  or  public  insurance  without  having  your \nhealthcare claims submitted to this database. Is there an opt-out? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nMS. RUYBALID: \nI have seen other states include opt-out language of identifiable data. Again, the \ndata we would publicly publish would be aggregated data. It would not have \nany unique patient identifiers. The only time direct patient identifiers would be \nreleased is in the case of researchers requesting data. We would have strict \ndata use agreements in place. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nI understand we try to protect the data as best as we can, but when we hold it \nall in one place, it becomes a target. I share Dr. Hardy's concerns about an \nindividual who is potentially required to carry health insurance, then have the \ndata  collected  by  the  health  insurance  company  as  a  part  of  the  payment \nsystem and be required to be turn over data to the government for analysis. It is \nmore of a philosophical statement than a question. \n \nASHER LISEC (PhRMA): \nWe  support  S.B.  40  and  the  APCD.  We  have  submitted  two  clarifying \namendments (Exhibit J). This will help highlight the cost drivers in the State and \nprovide important Nevada-specific data on healthcare costs. The first relates to \nthe  definition  of  proprietary  financial  information  in  section  7.  The  second \namendment relates to section 20. If there is a report released and available, the \nreport should consider race, ethnicity and other health disparities. This is an \nimportant area for the State to consider—especially given the pandemic and \ninequities we have seen in health care. It would not require DHHS to collect any \nadditional information, but consider if you can determine information based on \nneighborhood or zip code. We have reviewed amendments submitted by others, \nand PhRMA has some concerns with the amendment offered by the Office of \nthe Attorney General in section 1, subsection 2. We look forward to seeing the \npassage of S. B. 40. \n \nMR. CLARK: \nWe support this bill. I am speaking to a conceptual amendment on S.B. 40 on \nbehalf  of  Nevada  Association  of  Health  Plans,  Nevada  Hospital  Association, \nNevada  State  Medical  Association  and  Pharmaceutical  Care  Management \nAssociation (Exhibit K). The APCD will be a tool for public policy which will \nbenefit  Nevada  long-term.  We  want  to  make  it  robust,  accurate  and  as \nuncomplicated as possible. I will speak to sections 9 through 14 and section 17. \nBill Welch will discuss section 8 regarding needed definitions Exhibit K. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \nBILL WELCH (Nevada Hospital Association): \nWe support S.B. 40. I will speak specifically about section 8 and the definitions \nas outlined in Exhibit K. \n \nKATIE RYAN (Dignity Health – St. Rose Dominican): \nWe support the conceptual amendment submitted on behalf of Nevada Hospital \nAssociation and passage of S.B. 40. \n \nMS. CAPURRO: \nOn behalf of the Health Services Coalition, we support S.B. 40. We want to be \non the record to ensure anything in the APCD is HIPAA compliant for our clients \nand should there be any sort of data breach, our clients are not responsible. \n \nBOBBETTE BOND (Culinary Health Fund): \nWe support S.B. 40. By way of disclosure, I am a member of the Commission \nbut am here on behalf of the Culinary Health Fund. We support the bill in its \ncurrent  version.  We  support  the  legislation  for  three  reasons:  Current  State \nhealthcare  transparencies  are  incomplete  and  behind  many  states;  it  is  an \nimportant vehicle to monitor and evaluate the healthcare system going forward; \nand  it  is  an  important  foundation  for  new  models,  price  and  quality \nmanagement. \n \nThe Employee Retirement Income Security Act plans are optional; individuals \ncan participate by choice. The product has to be transparent, and so it is a \nprocess. We support the program being housed within the public health arena \nand urge the Senate Committee on Health and Human Services to pass the bill \nas  created,  not  the  bill  as  amended  by  the  stakeholder  amendments. \nParticularly, we oppose legislation which would de-identify the elements needed \nin a database, such as the provider, facility and price paid for services or care. \nWe need this information for the database to work. The database should also \nspan  times.  The  amendments  we  heard  about  today  indicate  the  database \nwould not include these elements; trends are important so we want to make \nsure the  data is included. We want to ensure the committees assigned are \nadvisory only and not in charge of deciding what data would be submitted in the \nend. This enabling legislation has a long way to go in the regulatory process, \nbut we support the program as it develops. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \nCHRIS BOSSE (Renown Health): \nWe support S.B. 40 with the conceptual amendments offered by the industry \nstakeholders. We appreciate the work the Commission has done to prioritize the \nimplementation  of  an  APCD  in  Nevada.  The  Commission  recognized  the \nimportant impact an APCD could have. The industry stakeholder group came \ntogether providing feedback on S.B. 40 to ensure best practices and lessons \nlearned  from  other  states  were  incorporated  on  the  front  end  of  our \nimplementation. The recommendations the industry has proposed will ensure \nsuccessful implementation, operation and meaningful use of the APCD as early \nas it can be recognized. \n \nDAN MUSGROVE (Valley Health System of Hospitals): \nWe support S.B. 40. We also support the conceptual amendments submitted by \nthe stakeholders, led by Bill Welch and Tom Clark. We want to look at the best \npractices of other states and want to have the best bill we possibly can. \n \nKATIE ROBBINS (Planned Parenthood): \nWe support S.B. 40. The ability for the Commission to create an APCD will be \nan important tool in identifying how we can improve care and costs for all \nNevadans. Having a more holistic understanding of quality, efficiency and cost \nof care is a good step toward making health care more equitable and fair in \nNevada, something we know is critically needed. \n \nMARK KRUEGER (Chief Deputy Attorney General, Office of the Attorney General): \nI am testifying as neutral and will explain the amendment submitted (Exhibit L). \nThere  seems  to  be  unintended  consequences  with  capturing  confidential \ninvestigations by the Office of the Attorney General. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe need clarification on the second piece of your amendment. \n \nMR. KRUEGER: \nThe second piece is in section 13. Under our Unfair Trade Practices Act under \nNRS 598A, we conduct confidential investigations and many times we work \nwith the Federal Trade Commission, Department of Justice, under a court order \nor with other states. The unintended consequence of not exempting out the \nconfidentiality of those investigations would put us at odds with our federal or \nstate partners or a court in our ability to continue our investigations, which we \nalready have authority under NRS 598A. Exempting us out from the reporting of \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \ninformation  we  receive  during  those  investigations  would  protect  that \ninformation and allow us to conduct our investigation. If information becomes \npublic at a later time, we have no objection to cooperating with the Commission \nand turning information over to the extent we can. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nYou believe there is language in this bill which would prohibit activities you are \nalready doing? \n \nMR. KRUEGER: \nThe bill's language will not prohibit us from doing the activities but will make it \nimpossible for us to do activities with our federal or state partners. It would act \nas  a  barrier  for  us  being  able  to  conduct  our  thorough  investigations  into \nantitrust. Ironically, these are the exact reasons for the bill and intent, to take a \npeek  at  healthcare  costs  and  make  sure  the  healthcare  costs  have  good \ncompetition in the marketplace. At the same time, we might be able to benefit \nin  our  investigations  by  seeing  certain  information  from  the  Commission \ncollected through this bill. The information, to the extent we could receive and \nconduct investigations under our authority, may also help us while making sure \nthe markets are competitive and robust. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs it specifically the claims data we anticipate being in the database you are \nconcerned about? \n \nMR. KRUEGER: \nNo, it is not specifically the claims data, it is going back to section 1. It is the \ndata regarding the cost of health care and particularly, consolidation among \nentities who provide for health care. It is the market data, anticompetitive or \ncompetitive behavior. \n \nCHRIS NEAL (CarFax): \nI am testifying as neutral and will read from my written testimony (Exhibit M) to \npropose an amendment to S.B. 40. We believe the current definition of \"direct \npatient  identifier\"  in  the  bill  requires  amendment.  The  vehicle  identification \nnumber should be stricken from the list of identifiers. The current definitions of \n\"direct\"  and  \"indirect\"  patient  identifiers  should  reclassify  the  license  plate \nnumber to \"indirect identifier\" given its public visibility and inability to identify \nan individual. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 27 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIn section 1, subsection 2 the Commission is empowered to mandate analysis of \nhealthcare information from local governments. Have you received any feedback \nfrom those local governments on this language? \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nI have not received any feedback from local governments on this language, but \nwould be happy to reach out and connect with them and come back to you. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIt is one thing to get a report or request an existing report, but requiring another \ngovernmental entity to do an analysis of information is something new. \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nSection 1 states the Commission may request a report which would happen in \nthe form of a public meeting or a public request by the Commission. The local \ngovernments would be properly notified of what the Commission is intending to \nrequest. It is not an automatic mandate on the local governments. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will now close the hearing on S.B. 40. One of the two concepts brought \nforward today is making sure gains, in terms of use and access of telehealth \nduring  the  state  of  emergency,  could  continue  after  the  emergency  is \ncompleted. The second concept is taking a significant step forward toward the \ntransparency of health care so we can manage costs. \n \nMs. Cholhagian, please talk about the exciting announcement made today about \na project which includes Nevada. \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nI am happy to share the news Nevada has been selected to participate in a \nmultistate collaborative effort with Peterson-Milbank Foundation on a program \nto address sustainable healthcare costs. I anticipate further discussion on this \nproject at the Commission's next meeting on March 15. \n   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 28 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nHearing no public comment, the meeting is adjourned at 5:56 p.m. \n \n  \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nNorma Mallett, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 29 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nExhibit  Begins \nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \nLetter  on Page \n  A  1    Agenda \nSara Cholhagian / \nS.B. 5  B  1  Patient Protection  Presentation \nCommission \nKyra Morgan / \nS.B. 5  C  1  Department of Health  Proposed Amendment \nand Human Services \nClaudia Duck Tucker / \nS.B. 5  D  1  Written Testimony \nTeladoc \nClaudia Duck Tucker / \nS.B. 5  E  1  Proposed Amendment \nTeladoc \nKyle Zebley / American \nS.B. 5  F  1  Telemedicine  Written Testimony \nAssociation \nKyle Zebley / American \nS.B. 5  G  1  Telemedicine  Proposed Amendment \nAssociation \nS.B. 5  H  1  Charlie Shepard / AARP  Support Statement \nSara Cholhagian / \nS.B. 40  I  1  Patient Protection  Presentation \nCommission \nS.B. 40  J  1  Asher Lisec / PhRMA  Proposed Amendment \nTom Clark / Nevada \nS.B. 40  K  1  Association of Health  Proposed Amendment \nPlans  \nBill Welch / Nevada \nS.B. 40  K  1  Association of Health  Proposed Amendment \nPlans \nMark Krueger / Office of \nS.B. 40  L  1  Proposed Amendment \nthe Attorney General \nS.B. 40  M  1  Chris Neal / Carfax  Proposed Amendment \n ", "50": "\nMINUTES OF THE  \nSENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n \nEighty-first Session \nMarch 11, 2021 \n \n \nThe Senate Committee on Health and Human Services was called to order by \nChair Julia Ratti at 3:31 p.m. on Thursday, March 11, 2021, Online.

(BDR 39-870) \n \nSENATOR JAMES OHRENSCHALL (Senatorial District No. 21): \nI will read from my written statement (Exhibit B). \n \nAMY HONONDEL (Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada): \nI have submitted a written statement (Exhibit C) in support of S.B. 146 and will \noutline the bill and its proposed amendment (Exhibit D) prior to reading from my \nstatement. \n \nSection 1, subsection 1 of the amendment, Exhibit D, requires the admitting \nstaff at a locked mental health facility reach out to a foster child’s main treating \nmental health provider after asking the person bringing the child to the facility if \nthey have a treating psychiatrist or main treating provider. It requires the staff \nto make reasonable efforts to reach that person.  \n \nIf  he  or  she  is  able  to  reach  that  person,  section  1,  subsection  2  of  the \namendment  requires  the  admitting  staff  of  the  hospital  to  make  reasonable \nefforts to coordinate care with the main treatment provider who sees the child \non a regular nonemergent basis. They would also be required to consider input \nfrom  that  treatment  provider  in  determining  the  level  of  care  the  child  will \nreceive while admitted to that locked inpatient facility. \n \nSection 1, subsection 3 of the amendment requires the staff at the admitting \nfacility to get consent from the legal custodian of the child and talk to the child \nobtaining their assent or agreement to coordinate care while in the hospital with \nthe child’s team of mental healthcare providers on the outside. \n \nWhat has become apparent to me from a qualitative observational standpoint \nand my education on child welfare and practice, is youth in foster care have a \nsignificantly higher rate of diagnoses of mental healthcare problems than our \ngeneral population. An article I read recently states 80 percent of the foster care \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \npopulation has mental healthcare issues needing treatment, versus 18 percent \nto 22 percent of the general population. In coordinating care, unlike a child who \nmay  be  in  a  one-or  two-parent  household,  what  makes  it  difficult  for  our \npopulation is that our population is transient. Transient means moving foster \nchildren between placement as we attempt to get them to their forever home or \nwith family, or caseworkers who are advocating or representing these children \nthrough the various child welfare agencies. There is also diffusion of authority in \nthat we have multiple providers, a child welfare worker, attorneys and the court \noverseeing  what  happens  to  these  children.  This  makes  care  coordination \nparticularly difficult.  \n \nThis bill is not intended to undercut what is being done by the mental health \nproviders we have. Rather it is to get them to start coordinating care. When the \ncare is better coordinated, the outcomes are better for our foster youth. Many \nof us will agree we need to improve the outcomes for these children as they are \nat a significant disadvantage. \n \nWe  want  to  make  a  foundation,  or  dialog,  between  the  mental  healthcare \nproviders who deal with our foster youth who do not have a parent to fight for \nthem. They have a caseworker who may sometimes be an on-call worker or \nfoster parent who does not know them. We want the medical professionals to \nstart  communicating  to  get  better  outcomes  for  these  youth  in  the  least \ndestructive setting.  \n \nBAILEY BORTOLIN (Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers): \nOur conversations have led to what looks like a scary amendment; however, it \ncontains language everyone agrees fixes a problem and codifies a best practice \nthat could make a difference for our foster youth. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs this bill intended to be for inpatient admitting only? \n \nMS. HONODEL: \nYes. This is to be used for inpatient admission to a locked facility only. While I \ndo not see the wording for emergency or unplanned, I would submit to the \nCommittee that would be the only time it would be used, when we do have \nplanned admissions. We have a separate procedure in Nevada Revised Statues \n(NRS)  432B,  Court-Ordered  Admission  of  Certain  Children  with  Emotional \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nDisturbance  to  Certain  Facilities,  to  make  a  request  to  the  court  for  court \nordered admissions. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs  this  narrowly  tailored  to  an  emergency  or  unplanned  admittance  to  an \ninpatient facility? \n \nMS. HONODEL: \nCorrect. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIt  appears  there  is  narrowing  language  in  section  1,  subsection  1  of  the \nproposed  amendment, Exhibit D,  that  states  “or  another  healthcare  provider \nauthorized to diagnose and treat mental disorders.” Can we be clear about what \nhealthcare providers we are talking about? \n \nMS. HONODEL: \nFrom the legal advocacy standpoint, this would be someone who is qualified to \ndiagnose a child with either an emotional disturbance or mental health disorder. \nWe are looking at psychiatrists and psychologists, to the extent that certain \nlevel therapists, depending on their training, can make or suggest a diagnosis. \nWe would include them, but this would not be the social work interns working \nunder supervision. We are looking for someone who has a rapport with the \nchild, who is familiar with the child’s treatment and has the requisite education \nand licensure to do diagnose and treat. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nPerhaps an Advanced Practice Registered Nurse (APRN) with an emphasis in \nbehavioral health? \n \nMS. HONODEL: \nCorrect. I have a client that does see an APRN supervised by child psychiatrists \nto diagnose and write prescriptions.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe want to ensure this is drafted correctly to be inclusive of those that would \nmake sense. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nLEON RAVIN, M.D. (Psychiatric Medical Director, Division of Public and Behavioral \nHealth, Department of Health and Human Services): \nThe scope of the individuals who could provide input to the inpatient treatment \nteam  should  include  all  professions  primarily  responsible  for  diagnosis  and \ntreatment of the child in an outpatient setting. Most commonly it would be a \npsychiatrist. We also have to recognize a number of children receiving care from \nproviders such as an APRN since they receive legal rights to practice as licensed \nindependent  providers  without  supervisional  collaboration.  It  is  my \nunderstanding, with the permission of the Nevada State Board of Nursing, they \ncan practice within the scope of psychiatric mental health when they have the \nappropriate credentials and qualifications.  \n \nIn  addition,  there  could  be  a  physician  assistant  who  practices  under  the \nsupervision of a psychiatrist or primary care provider. We need to recognize \nmany  individuals  receive  help  for  their  psychiatric  needs  from  primary  care \nfamily physicians so they could be included.  \n \nIn  cases  when  a  child  is  not  in  need  of  psychotropic  medications,  it  is \nforeseeable a psychologist would be the primary healthcare provider for a child \nfor his or her mental health needs. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI heard psychiatrists, APRNs, physician assistants, primary care physicians and \npsychologists. What about licensed clinical social workers or licensed family \ntherapists? \n \nDR. RAVIN: \nI cannot speak on behalf of the licensed clinical counselors. This should be \nprofessionals who are typically authorized to have medium privileges to inpatient \npsychiatric services. These would usually be physicians, physician assistants or \nAPRNs. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe will need to ensure the amendment, Exhibit D, includes only those with \nadmitting privileges or any behavioral healthcare professional already connected \nwith  a  child  who  may  have  input.  Our  challenge  is  that  another  healthcare \nprovider authorized to diagnose and treat could be a psychologist or a licensed \nmarriage and family therapist social worker.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nDR. RAVIN: \nIt may make sense to split the professionals into two categories. Section 1, \nsubsection  2  of  the  proposed  amendment,  Exhibit  D,  primarily  focuses  on \ndetermining the level of care for the child, determining whether or not to admit \nthe child to the most restrictive settings of an inpatient treatment facility or to \ncontinue treating the child in outpatient settings. This is where you may need a \nprofessional who is at the level of qualifying for ten-minute meeting privileges at \nthe  hospital.  For  ongoing  coordination  of  care  and  discharge  planning,  any \nmental health professional primarily involved in treating a child for mental or \nbehavioral health should be included. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThis makes sense when continuity of care is the goal wherever they are already \nconnected to care.  \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nWhy  are  we  limiting  this  to  juveniles  who  are  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the \njuvenile court? These are the children that legal aid often interacts with. Are we \nseeing this gap with other children as well? \n \nMS. BORTOLIN: \nWhen we started having conversations with treating doctors working within the \nNRS 432B context, we identified that children who already have a diagnosis and \nmedications  are  being  treated  and  end  up  with  a  different  diagnosis  and \nprescribed medications. We were asked to coordinate that care and told this \nwas a best practice and should be happening.  \n \nWe thought the gap was specific to NRS 432B, so we wanted to solve the \nproblem for our clients. I cannot with any first-hand knowledge speak to what is \nhappening elsewhere, but will say that we have gotten feedback that it may \nmake sense to broaden this. \n \nDR. RAVIN: \nI agree the same level of cooperation constitutes good clinical practice across all \nages.  Overall  as  a  practicing  physician,  we  should  not  be  making  the \ndetermination on the scope of care provided, or the level of coordination based \non whether or not the child has parents and is in foster care or any other \nfacility. Even if the person is an adult, we should still strive to maintain the best \ncooperation between inpatient and outpatient providers. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nSENATOR OHRENSCHALL: \nIn my experience practicing in the delinquency courts, not in the abuse and \nneglect sphere, I have heard from parents who have felt frustrated when a child \nwas committed to a State correctional facility having previously had a treating \npsychiatrist. They felt there was a disconnect between the care plan prior to the \nchild  being  committed  to  a  correctional  facility  rather  than  a  mental  health \nfacility. \n \nThis is anecdotal. I do not have studies as to whether this is an issue, but have \nobserved this in terms of continuity of care and whether there is a disconnect in \nthe treatment plan at the facility. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nI  have  a  question  on  the  language  in  section  1,  subsection  1,  versus  the \nlanguage  in  subsection  3  of  the  proposed  amendment, Exhibit  D.  In \nsubsection 1,  we  refer  “to  a  treatment  facility  or  other  division  facility  for \ninpatient  psychiatric  care.”  This  seems  a  bit  broader  than  the  language  in \nsubsection 3 which is “an inpatient psychiatric treatment facility.” \n \nAre these two sections congruent, or is there a reason one is broader than the \nother? \n \nMS. BORTOLIN: \nThis got lost in translation due to the many meetings with stakeholders and has \nbeen recognized by your Committee staff. Clark County Department of Child \nand  Family  Services  requested  subsection  3  narrowing  to  an  inpatient \npsychiatric  treatment  facility,  and  we  will  now  go  back  to  mirror  that  in \nsubsection 1. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe intent of the bill is to apply only to inpatient psychiatric treatment facilities. \nIs that correct? \n \nMS. BORTOLIN: \nYes. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWould this be DCFS facilities only, or would this include private facilities as \nNRS 432B is specific to DCFS as opposed to private facilities? \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nMS. HONODEL: \nThis  bill  is  intended  to  apply  to  both,  which  may  be  the  reason  for  the \nconflicting language. Our youth in Clark County are admitted to both State and \nprivate facilities on an inpatient basis. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nIn section 1, subsection 1 there is a change from “before” to “when”. Why was \nthis change made, and what does “when” mean? \n \nMS. BORTOLIN: \nSome of the concerns were from a practical standpoint. Legally, we agree with \nyou. Practically speaking, we thought “before” made more of a connotation of \n“we cannot do this unless.” We wanted to make it abundantly clear this was a \n“when practicable,” but should not be seen as a basis for denial.  \n \nBRIGID  DUFFY:  (Director,  Juvenile  Division,  Clark  County  District  Attorney’s \nOffice): \nThe  DCFS  requested  to  change  the  “before”  to  “when”,  specifically  what \nMs. Bortolin had expressed. When children are continually cycling into acute \nepisodes  for  emergency  treatment,  we  have  limited  providers  for  our \nyounger-aged children. We wanted to ensure we were not closing opportunities \nfor  our  children  based  on  facilities  stating  they  could  not  reach  a  treating \nhealthcare provider and were unable to admit the child for emergency treatment. \nWe were afraid of how that might be interpreted at 3:00 a.m. by the staff of a \nhospital, believing it would be clearer for everyone to understand, that when \nadmitting a child, you need to make the reasonable effort to contact the treating \nprovider. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nIs there is a reasonable time limit, perhaps within 48 hours? Stating “make \nreasonable effort” alone seems it would address your concern without making \nthe language change. Would it be possible to put an actual requirement that this \nreasonable  effort  be  made  within  a  certain  amount  of  time  as  opposed  to \nleaving it open? \n \nMs. DUFFY: \nReasonable effort was the recommended language of the DCFS. I agree there \nshould  be  some  sort  of  “no  later  than,”  but  again,  we  are  all  working  to \ncompromise and provide the best bill possible.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nDR. RAVIN: \nFrom a medical perspective, it would help to not have a specific deadline on \nhow long the treatment team should make a reasonable effort or at what point \nthey should continue. The considerations are that if a child is brought to a \nfacility on Friday night, the outpatient provider may not be available for his or \nher input until Monday morning. If we say the inpatient treatment team should \nseek that input no later than 12 to 24 hours from the time of admission, we are \nrisking the possibility they will try to seek the input only for the duration of time \noutlined in the language of the bill. After that, they will add an entry in the chart \nstating they attempted to make contact with no response and that would be the \nend of the effort.  \n \nFrom the clinical care perspective, it would make sense for the treatment team \nto continue seeking input and coordination of care for the duration of treatment. \nFor whatever reason they were not successful in making contact during the \nearly hours or days of treatment, they will continue to attempt contact for the \nduration of the treatment episode. \n \nDASHUN JACKSON (Children’s Advocacy Alliance): \nThe  Children’s  Advocacy  Alliance  supports  S.B. 146.  This  bill  promotes  the \nmental  and  emotional  health  of  a  child  and  recognizes  the  trauma  a  child \nexperiences when removed from their home and placed in a facility. This bill \nallows continuity of care while preventing a child from being overmedicated and \nreducing the trauma to the child. This will also allow and promote youth having \na voice. \n \nKENDRA BERTSCHY (Deputy Public Defender, Public Defender's Office, Washoe \nCounty): \nThe Washoe County Public Defender’s Office supports S.B. 146. We appreciate \nthis  bill  being  brought  forward  to  ensure  continuity  of  care  for  children.  I \npreviously worked as a children’s attorney and handled the dockets specifically \nfor child commitment hearings. I would agree with the statement that this can \nbe traumatic, and we are potentially preventing future harm to these children by \nallowing for continuity of care. \n \nJIMMY LAU (Dignity Health – St. Rose Dominican): \nContinuity and coordination of care is an important component to the overall \nimprovement  of  health  outcomes,  especially  to  the  most  vulnerable  in  our \ncommunity.  We  thank  Senator  Ohrenschall  for  bringing  this  legislation  and \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nsupport his effort to enhance continuity and coordination of care for at-risk \nchildren.  \n \nMS. DUFFY: \nThe Clark County DCFS supports S.B. 146 and the policy of ensuring we are \ncoordinating mental health care for our children in foster care. Our children often \ncome with complex levels of trauma and are in need of consistent treatment. \nWhen  a  child  has  an  acute  episode  and  needs  emergency  placement  in  a \npsychiatric  treatment  facility,  it  is  best  practice  and  in  our  children’s  best \ninterest that providers on the outside or the ongoing healthcare providers with \nan established relationship with our children and the acute inpatient psychiatric \ncare provider are communicating.  \n \nOur  children  are  suffering  on  many  levels  throughout  this  pandemic. \nTwenty-three of Clark County School District children have committed suicide \nthis past year. This is a crisis that is impacting not only foster children but all \nchildren across Nevada.  \n \nSENATOR OHRENSCHALL: \nI have heard the Committee’s suggestions in terms of additional detail to the \ndefinition of healthcare provider and the idea of expanding to other children.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 146 and open the hearing on S.B. 158. \n \nSENATE BILL 158: Revises requirements to receive assistance from the Kinship \nGuardianship Assistance Program. (BDR 38-504) \n \nSENATOR JAMES OHRENSCHALL (Senatorial District No. 21): \nI have a submitted written statement (Exhibit E) outlining S.B. 158. \n \nPATRICK HIRSCH (Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada): \nI will read from my written testimony (Exhibit F). \n \nMR. JACKSON: \nThe Children’s Advocacy Alliance supports S.B. 158. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nMS. BORTOLIN: \nThis is a  short and simple bill. The language in  the amendment  (Exhibit G) \nmirrors the federal requirements to use federal funding. This does not change \nanything  about  the  way  the  program  should  work.  We  all  agree  that \nguardianship  is  in  the  best  interest  of  a  child  and  the  most  appropriate \nplacement.  In  some  cases,  we  have  issues  getting  funding  around  a  legal \nimpossibility question—in ten years would it be legally impossible that someone \nmight prefer to adopt a child and do what is in the child’s best interest today? \nWe are working through that statute.  \n \nMS. DUFFY: \nI would like to thank everyone involved in bringing forth S.B. 158 and working \nwith the child welfare agencies to come to an agreement on the amendment \nthat aligns us with federal language and will not impact our federal funding. I \nwas  assured  that  Clark  County  can  remove  its  fiscal  note  if  the  proposed \namendment,  Exhibit  G,  is  accepted,  which  changes  the  original  restrictive \nlanguage drafted and will move us to federally approved language opening up \nKinGAP guardianship for more children and families. \n \nALISON CALIENDO, PH.D. (Executive Director, Foster Kinship): \nI have submitted written testimony (Exhibit H) in support of S.B. 158. \n \nMS. BERTSCHY: \nThe Washoe County Public Defender’s Office supports S.B. 158. The Kinship \nCare Program is an important piece of the process, and we appreciate the work \nto expand this program to help more families. These families are those already \ntaking in their relatives to provide them with a better future. The more we can \ndo to help them and those children the better Nevada will be. \n \nKATHRYN ROOSE (Deputy Administrator, Quality and Oversight, Division of Child \nand Family Services, Department of Health and Human Services): \nThe Division of Child and Family Services is in the neutral position to S.B. 158. \nThe Division submitted a fiscal note based on the original version of the bill and \nwill remove it with the amended language. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 158. \n   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAs there is no public comment, this meeting is adjourned at 4:34 p.m. \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nVickie Polzien, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nBegins \nExhibit \nBill   on  Witness / Entity  Description \nLetter \nPage \n  A  1    Agenda \nSenator James \nS.B. 146  B  1  Written Statement \nOhrenschall  \nAmy Honodel / Legal \nS.B. 146  C  1  Aid Center of Southern  Support Statement \nNevada \nAmy Honodel / Legal \nS.B. 146  D  1  Aid Center of Southern  Proposed Amendment \nNevada \nSenator James \nS.B. 158  E  1  Written Statement \nOhrenschall \nPatrick Hirsch / Legal \nS.B. 158  F  1  Aid Center of Southern  Support Statement \nNevada \nSenator James \nS.B. 158  G  1  Proposed Amendment \nOhrenschall \nAlison Caliendo / Foster \nS.B. 158  H  1  Support Statement \nKinship \n ", "51": "\nMINUTES OF THE  \nSENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n \nEighty-first Session \nMarch 18, 2021 \n \n \nThe Senate Committee on Health and Human Services was called to order by \nChair Julia Ratti at 3:38 p.m. on Thursday, March 18, 2021, Online.

(BDR 56-135) \n \nSENATOR ROBERTA LANGE (Senatorial District No. 7): \nI am introducing S.B. 168 which deals with two items, cannabis curbside pickup \nand cannabis packaging and labeling, which I will discuss in the presentation \n(Exhibit B). I am joined today by Layke Martin, Executive Director of the Nevada \nDispensary Association. We are presenting this bill and amendment together \n(Exhibit C) in cooperation with the Cannabis Compliance Board (CCB). \n \nLAYKE MARTIN (Executive Director, Nevada Dispensary Association): \nI will read from my written testimony (Exhibit D) regarding cannabis curbside \npickup,  cannabis  packaging  and  labeling,  and  the  proposed  amendment \nExhibit C. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIs there any advertising or signage that comes with this curbside pickup? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nMS. MARTIN: \nI will defer to the CCB for their guidance related to what is required for curbside \npickup. \n \nTYLER KLIMAS (Executive Director, Nevada Cannabis Compliance Board): \nI will ask Kara Cronkhite, who heads audit inspections in my agency, to talk \nabout some of the restrictions for curbside that exist. \n \nKARA CRONKHITE (Health Program Manager, Nevada Cannabis Compliance Board): \nWe have restrictions in place through policy that we would incorporate into \nregulation  regarding  curbside  pickup.  Identifications  of  every  person  in  the \nvehicle are checked. The employees check the order and have to wear masks \nand gloves when handling any product or orders. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIs there a limit on advertising or signage involved with the curbside pickup? Are \nwe keeping within the bounds already existing for advertising and signage of the \ndispensaries? \n \nMS. CRONKHITE: \nYes, we are keeping with the current requirements for advertising and signage. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe insertion of the amended language regarding the labeling of products for \nsale and the removal of language as it relates to production, is this just to \nrecognize  how  product  flows  through  the  production,  manufacturing  and \ndistribution chain so labeling is focused on the consumer rather than every step \nin the process? \n \nMS. MARTIN: \nYou are exactly right. It is to allow flexibility for CCB to determine how the \nwording should be best conveyed versus having specific stops where everybody \nhas to apply their own labels. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nI refer to the amendment, top of page 8, where you are striking \"a written \nnotification with each sale of ... \" and replacing it with \"A cannabis sales facility \nshall convey the following information to consumers ... .\" Is there anything that \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nsays it can just be verbal? Can you just have a sign posted on the wall behind \nthe register?  Does there have to be an actual delivery of content? \n \nMS. MARTIN: \nThe intention is to make sure the information is presented in the best way \npossible  to  the  consumer.  There  is  not  an  intent  it  would  be  on  a  sign  or \nverbally conveyed. We are looking at a printout at the point of sale versus a \nsheet that is slipped into the exit bag versus a label on the product itself. We \npropose leaving it to the CCB to handle in regulation to determine what the best \nmanner is to convey the information. I do not think the CCB has any intention of \nallowing those warnings to be given verbally. \n \nMATTHEW WALKER (Nevada Dispensary Association): \nI would point you to the presentation, Exhibit B, on both those questions and \nthe manner in which something is prescribed to be on the label versus on the \nsticker attached to it. You can see on the smaller products what results is less \ninformation being meaningfully conveyed to the consumer. We are hoping to \nclear  the  statutory  path  so  the  CCB  can  comprehensively  take  up  these \nregulations and ensure the information is made available, is absorbed by the \nconsumer and can be compared among products. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe intent is it would not be up to the dispensary to decide how to convey the \ninformation, but rather we are taking it out of statute and putting it into the \nregulatory framework. So your body would still perform the regulatory process, \nwould give detailed instructions and would be more flexible to change because \nit is in the regulatory framework instead of the statutory framework. Is this the \nidea? \n \nMR. KLIMAS: \nYes. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWould you say for the record you do not intend to loosen the labeling or the \nstandards in terms of the information the consumers need to stay safe? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nMR. KLIMAS: \nAbsolutely. Core principles, public health and safety will be at the top of my list \nwhenever we promulgate any regulations around what is conveyed as far as \ninformation. \n \nDARRELL LACY (Planet 13 Holdings, Inc.): \nWe support S.B. 168 and offer a support statement (Exhibit E).  \n \nSENATOR LANGE: \nThis is not something new. It was already happening in curbside pickup and was \nsuccessful for the business owners and patrons. The bill puts this into law. The \nlabeling ensures these products are safe and people know what is in them when \nthey take the products home. Products that look like candy are marked so they \ndo not look like candy and can be kept out of the reach of children. Those kinds \nof things are important components in the industry.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will now close the hearing on S.B. 168. I will open the work session on \nS.B. 49. \n \nSENATE BILL 49: Revises provisions relating to cannabis. (BDR 56-268) \n \nMEGAN COMLOSSY (Policy Analyst): \nI will read the summary of S.B. 49 and amendments from the work session \ndocument (Exhibit F). \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe had testimony on this bill, hearing from individuals who were concerned \nabout  the  ability  to  do  background  checks  in  publicly  traded  companies.  \nStakeholders who were interested on that issue met with the CCB to see if they \ncould mutually agree. We did not come to a 100 percent agreement, but CCB \nbelieves  many  of  the  stakeholders'  concerns  could  be  addressed  through  a \nregulatory process.  \n \nMR. KLIMAS: \nThat  is  correct.  We  do  have  a  number  of  publicly  traded  companies  in  the \nindustry. Nevada Cannabis Compliance Regulation 5 (NCCR 5), is a regulation \ndealing  with  publicly  traded  companies,  background  checks  and  waivers. \nWaivers of ownership under 5 percent allow for publicly traded companies with \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nseveral  shareholders  to  continue  to  make  day  trades  and  purchase  and  sell \nshares. Waivers of ownership under 5 percent do not have to go through a \ncomplete registration process that any owner over 5 percent has to go through. \nThere has been input from publicly traded companies about the 5 percent and \n10  percent  thresholds.  There  are  suggestions  on  how  to  streamline  that \nprocess, and the CCB understands those concerns. At the last Board meeting, it \nis on record CCB will hold workshops, both informal and formal whenever we \nmake regulatory changes, so there will be plenty of opportunity to talk through \nNCCR  5.  We  encourage  input  from  all  our  publicly  traded  companies, \nstakeholders and the public. We look forward to continuing to refine NCCR 5 \nand all our regulations as they are living documents. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWould you acknowledge there could be better processes when it comes to \npublicly  traded  companies,  and  that  is  your  intent  by  opening  up  those \nworkshops on this part of your regulations? \n \nMR. KLIMAS: \nCorrect.  With  publicly  traded  companies  and  different  ownership  structures, \nthere  are  many  scenarios  and  situations  that  go  along  with  ownership  and \ntransfer of ownership, stock shares and selling stocks. We certainly anticipate \ngetting into NCCR 5 and making changes that account for all those situations \nthat arise and to help streamline the process for both regulators and members of \nthe industry. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe third amendment of the first paragraph states \"The Board may employ the \nservices of such persons it considers necessary for the purposes of hearing \ndisciplinary proceedings.\" Is it subject to the Open-Meeting Law? Do we know \nthe qualifications of those people who are employed to help or preclusions of \nwho is not?  \n \nMR. KLIMAS: \nIt allows us to hire an administrative law judge. This is similar to other State \nagencies. The CCB does not have its own administrative law judge. We have \nbeen borrowing the Department of Taxation's administrative law judge. This is \nwhat this amendment allows us to do and is the only service we would employ \nunder this subsection. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThis would not include an increase of fees for the people who are paying for the \ndisciplinary proceeding? \n \nMR. KLIMAS: \nThe administrative law judge is in the Governor's approved budget. The funds \nare in there. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will entertain a motion on S.B. 49. \n \n  SENATOR HARDY MOVED TO AMEND AND DO PASS AS AMENDED \nS.B. 49. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nDuring the hearing, I expressed a concern about the 45-day extension and its \nability to be done in perpetuity. I notice the bill still says may approve one or \nmore extensions. I encourage you through the regulatory process to put some \nconstraints around the 45-day extension so it cannot continually be pushed out. \nThere  need  to  be  clear  instructions  on  when  the  45-day  extension  will  be \ngranted or limits on how many times it can be done. At this time, I will vote the \nbill out of Committee but will reserve my right to change my vote on the Senate \nFloor. \n \n  THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will open the work session on S.B. 156. \n \nSENATE  BILL  156:  Revises  provisions  relating  to  crisis  stabilization  centers. \n(BDR 40-488) \n \nMS. COMLOSSY: \nI will read the summary of S.B. 156 and the amendments from the work session \ndocument (Exhibit G). \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe intent of this bill is to expand crisis stabilization centers from psychiatric \nhospitals to all hospitals, and we needed to work on the details of the wording \nto ensure we were getting to all hospitals. We have representatives of both \namendments if you have any clarifying questions. \n \nSENATOR HARDY MOVED TO AMEND AND DO PASS AS AMENDED \nS.B. 156. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIf we adopt amendment 2 as submitted by Mary Walker, Carson Tahoe Health, \ndo we still need to adopt amendment 1 as submitted by Joan Hall, Nevada Rural \nHospital Partners, since the intent of amendment 2 is to capture amendment 1? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nOur understanding from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) \nis we need to do both to capture all of the different types of hospitals. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will open the hearing on S.B. 175. \n \nSENATE BILL 175: Enacts provisions relating to lupus. (BDR 40-8) \n \nSENATOR DINA NEAL (Senatorial District No. 4): \nI am presenting S.B. 175, which is a bill about lupus. I want to show a quick \nvideo  about  what  lupus  is  and  share  written  presentations  (Exhibit  H)  and \n(Exhibit I) about lupus.  This bill would start tracking variants associated with \nlupus and get data on what is happening outside of the hospitalizations that are \noccurring for lupus patients. \n \nI have also submitted an amendment to S.B. 175 (Exhibit J). The most recent \nevent  around  lupus  funding  was  in  2020  when  Congress  authorized \n$8.5 million. Those funds went to the National Lupus Patient Registry indicating \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nthere was a clear interest to recognize the importance of what is going on with \nlupus. \n \nCALVINIA WILLIAMS (Founder and President, Lupus of Nevada): \nI support S.B. 175. The mission of Lupus of Nevada is educational awareness \nand advocacy. For the last 17 years, our program has consisted of nutritional \nworkshops, support group meetings, coping strategies, educational conferences, \ncommunity outreach and resources to assist our lupus community. \n \nIndividuals diagnosed with lupus face many obstacles. Some of our families and \nfriends  choose  to  blame  us  for  pretending  to  have  lupus  or  its  symptoms. \nUnfortunately, they are not aware of the impact of this devastating disease so \nthey choose to look the other way. I am a lupus survivor of 20 years. My \nmedications are 28 pills each day just to survive. \n \nYears ago, I was taken to the hospital as a possible stroke patient with lupus \nand other life-threatening problems associated with lupus. The head emergency \nroom (ER) doctor prevented the other physicians from injecting something into \nme for a stroke. The ER doctor explained lupus is the great imitator, and he did \nnot allow the injection. Instead, the ER doctor ordered other tests for me; I had \nbeen misdiagnosed. The ER doctor saved my life. How many more lupus lives \nhave been misdiagnosed and did not make it? For those reasons, please pass \nS.B. 175. \n \nCHAPLAIN WANDA BAILEY JOHNSON (Director, Outreach for Lupus, Nevada): \nI support S.B. 175. I was diagnosed with pseudomonas aeruginosa, a type of \nbacteria. This illness came from unclean tools or equipment in the hospital. I \nwas supposed to get a neural stimulator for my back to stimulate the pain; after \nchanging my bandage daily, it took three months to finally clear it up and get \nbetter. We need S.B. 175 so we will not be used as guinea pigs. We need \nphysicians  to  be  accountable  for  what  they  do,  what  they  give  to  lupus \npatients, and not just tell us it is a lupus flare up. \n \nOne year ago, when I was in the hospital, the doctors gave me 1,000 milligrams \nof prednisone for 4 days. They dropped it to 80 milligrams and sent me home. \nMy primary doctor told me it could have killed me. You are not supposed to \ndrop from a high dosage to a low dosage in an instant. You have to be weaned \noff and come down slowly off prednisone. It took my doctor weeks to get me \nback to the right dosage in order to treat my lupus. This bill would make the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \ndoctors accountable for giving lupus patients the right medication. Please pass \nthis bill. \n \nSHAEANN CLEMENTS-OJEDA: \nI  support  S.B.  175.  I  am  an  executive  board  member  of  the  Nevada  State \nDemocratic Party. I was diagnosed with lupus when I was nine years old and \nam on dialysis while waiting to get on a transplant list. We need more research, \ninformation and statistics to find better treatments and more resources. We also \nneed to hold our doctors accountable. Being diagnosed so young was a lucky \nthing for me. The pediatric staff was more attentive than the adult medical \nworld and, because of that, I knew who were the good doctors and nurses. \nWhen I became an adult, I came into the hospital with chest pains, severe \nheartburn, high heart rate and a sore left arm. I sat in the ER for two hours \nwithout any of my vitals taken or EKG with these symptoms. I kept asking the \nnurse when was someone going to take my vitals and EKG, and she would tell \nme \"soon.\" Finally, after sitting there for a few more hours, I demanded to \nknow why I had not had my vitals or EKG taken. I had all the symptoms of a \nheart attack and my family had a history of heart disease. \n \nA nurse sat down next to me and started rubbing my left arm that I had been \nholding.  I  told  her  I  was  in  severe  pain.  She  started  to  explain  how  the \ndemographics worked. Patients who were older and more predisposed to deadly \nissues would go first. Age and other things were factors for my long wait. I \nexplained I fully understood the demographics and any patient of any age with \nchest pain and head injuries takes precedent after fatal bleeding wounds. I went \non to say if she continued to say otherwise she would be facing violations for \nthis hospital. Almost immediately after saying this, I did finally get my vitals and \nEKG taken. I eventually found out it was pericarditis, inflammation of my heart's \nlining, a common symptom of lupus. It truly hurt like I was having a heart \nattack. \n \nLastly, you need to know about the severity of lupus and how it is different for \nevery patient. You could be like my friend who has painful but less deadly \nsymptoms. You could have the severity of these two women speaking here with \nme today. You have me, a 27-year-old on dialysis who almost died 3 different \ntimes. You also have my mother. She was not only diagnosed as a paranoid \nschizophrenic and had lupus serositis her whole life, she also died not long ago \nas she was being diagnosed while on a dialysis machine. She died from heart \nfailure. If not for a doctor in the psychiatric hospital she was in, who recognized \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nme, none of us would have known she had lupus, nor would we have known \nwhat could have been causing my mother's psychosis her whole life. \n \nShe was never able to raise her children as she desperately wanted to do since \nbefore  I  was  born  as  the  first  child.  Perhaps,  if  we  had  more  information \nregarding  lupus  patients  in  states  like  Nevada,  maybe  doctors  would  have \ncaught it sooner. Maybe I would have had a mother, instead of vague memories \nof her being unstable and dangerous and scared of the world her whole life due \nto living in a false reality; which was only a symptom. Her case should be \nrecorded and looked into and so should mine as every other lupus patient living \nin this State. \n \nSENATOR NEAL: \nThe three presenters we just heard offer different stories about how they have \nbeen affected by lupus. Section 5, subsection 2, paragraph (a) of S.B. 175 \nestablishes  a  system  where  we  can  conduct  comprehensive  epidemiology \nsurveys of lupus and its variants and evaluate the appropriateness and measures \nfor treatment. We need to understand what is happening because this disease \nmimics  other  diseases.  We  need  to  have  enough  data  and  education  for \nphysicians so they do not continue to misdiagnose lupus patients. \n \nSection 6 of the bill continues to prescribe the kind of information we need to \nseek within this framework, such as the variant for cases of lupus, the method \nof  treatment  without  limitation,  the  kind  of  drugs,  any  other  diseases  from \nwhich the patient suffers, and information containing the usage and access to \nhealthcare services. If a patient is diagnosed with lupus and dies, we need to \nknow what happened and how the patient died. \n \nWhen  we  listen  to  Ms.  Clements-Ojeda's  testimony,  if  her  mother  was \ndiagnosed, knowing there was a cognitive variant to lupus that would have \nhelped her get treatment earlier. What happened with the misdiagnosis of a \nstroke, when Ms. Williams truly had symptoms of lupus, is something that may \nhave happened to thousands of women. We do not know because there could \nhave been a doctor who said a patient was having a stroke, gave the patient \nmedication for a stroke and then effectively killed the patient. \n \nI felt this bill was important when these presenters approached me about this \nlegislation. The bill mimics A.B. No. 254 of the 80th Session, a bill I brought \nabout sickle cell disease. Nevada used to be part of the registry and collected \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \ndata. We fall in line with the national recommendations from 2015 from DHHS. \nThis bill is within the general guidelines of what is being expected as the first \nstep; to start collecting the data around patients; have the data housed and \nreported.  This  will  help  us  understand  what  is  going  on  with  these  lupus \npatients. The rest of the bill explains the analysis and confidentiality provisions \nof the reports that will be collected. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIs there a fiscal note attached to the bill? We had issues with the Nevada \nCentral Cancer Registry when we were trying to assess fees on the providers to \nreport data back to the Cancer Registry. It became a significant financial burden \non small doctor's offices and impeded the collection of data for the patients. In \nsections 7 and 8 of the bill, along the diagnosis and treatment spectrum, which \npeople are going to be assessed fees for collection of the data and who will be \nrequired to collect the data? \n \nSENATOR NEAL: \nThe majority of patients see rheumatologists in the State. There are about 13 or \n14 rheumatologists who focus on the autoimmune disease portion of lupus. The \nother entities potentially affected are the hospitals and the ERs that are seeing \nthe patient and transmitting the information. If the patient has a primary care \nphysician, then that physician would also be looped in. The provision in the bill \nis similar to a provision I had on a bill on sickle cell, A.B. No. 254 of the \n80th Session, where a fee was assessed. I recall conversations raised in the \nAssembly, but this has been the mechanism to get this information reported—to \nplace the onus on the actual entity treating the individual. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWe have a massive shortage of rheumatologists in this State. The financial onus \nof  the  State's  work  being  placed  on  a  small  number  of  providers  could  be \nproblematic. I do not know the workload of collecting single patient's files from \nmultiple providers, from a hospital to a primary care physician, and then creating \nan abstract for each one of those patients. It seems like a lot of work and I \nworry about what those fees might have to be to cover the cost of this bill. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe have Lindsay Kinsinger here from DHHS. The fiscal note has not dropped \nyet, but the deadline has not passed, and DHHS has worked on it. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nLINDSAY  KINSINGER  (Manager,  Office  of  Public  Health  Informatics  and \nEpidemiology, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, Department of \nHealth and Human Services): \nIt would be the cost of one full-time employee to do the work within our office \nto manage this registry, work on the fee structure, abstract the data, collect the \ndata, put it into our system and develop the reporting. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nDo you have an estimate of what the fee would be for each of the providers to \ngenerate that kind of revenue based on patients seen? \n \nMS. KINSINGER: \nIt would cost DHHS about $112,000 per year for one full-time employee. I do \nnot know how many rheumatologists there are across the State and how it \nwould break down. I am not fully aware of what levels are in each medical \nprovider's  office  the  State  has  collected.  This  employee  would  also  be \nresponsible for developing the fee structure and who would pay what. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nI appreciate the need for collecting and using this information. I worry the fee \nstructure may go against the good we are looking for in the bill. \n \nSENATOR NEAL: \nI understand there are going to be costs associated with this bill. In talking with \nDHHS, we could work out having one full-time employee. We have to take the \nfirst step in passing this bill because individuals are facing serious consequences \nof having an invincible disease. \n \nWhen I look at other states that have passed legislation, they have been few \nand far between. California unsuccessfully attempted to pass two bills twice. \nGeorgia has managed to form a commission on lupus. Illinois is the only state \nthat passed a bill about lupus for individuals. Nevada is one of those states that \n$112,000  will  save  10,000  women's  lives  after  being  misdiagnosed  and \nprovide enough data for us to get involved at the national level and obtain \nfunding. \n \nAs I mentioned earlier, the federal government took $8.5 million, but the total \namount that came out of Congress was $21.5 million; $10 million went to lupus \nresearch, $2 million went to the Office of Minority Health and $9.5 million went \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nto the National Lupus Patient Registry. There is an opportunity, if we pass this \nlegislation, to engage in grants and connect us from State to federal levels so \nwe can access funding. We do not have a framework to even enter the Lupus \nRegistry  nationally  because  we  do  not  have  legislation  that  is  asking  for \nsurveillance  data  around  these  patients.  I  understand  the  costs,  but  I  also \nunderstand if this bill would get a one-shot chance of getting $112,000, we \ncould walk into an environment where we would leverage ourselves for federal \ndollars. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nMy suggestion is if we want to prioritize it, let us find a quarter of a million \ndollars and do it, rather than trying to create this funding mechanism. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe suggestion is to take out the fee structure. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThis is a disease mostly affecting women. \n \nSENATOR NEAL: \nYes, 90 percent of lupus patients happen to be women. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nDo you know what percentage of them are Black, Indigenous and People of \nColor? \n \nSENATOR NEAL: \nIn Nevada, based on the available hospitalization data shown in Exhibit H, Black \nwomen represented 23.9 percent of the hospitalizations; 3.3 percent Hispanic; \n5.7  percent  Native  American/Alaskan  Native  non-Hispanic;  3.3  percent \nAsian/Pacific Islander non-Hispanic; and 4.0 percent White non-Hispanic. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThe last number for 2020 was 300,000 Nevadans that had been impacted by \nCovid-19. I think lupus is comorbidity when you are talking about diseases that \nepidemiologists track. Am I correct? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nSENATOR NEAL: \nI do not know if the epidemiologists are tracking the comorbidity; that is the \ndata I am trying to obtain. I do have data as to the number of deaths. There \nwere approximately 133 lupus-related deaths between 2017 and 2020. That \nwas a rate of 1.1 per 100,000 in Nevada. Approximately 83 percent of the \n133 deaths were female, 44 percent were white non-Hispanic and 23 percent \nwere Black non-Hispanic. The data is based on the ICD-10 codes DHHS was \nable to pull for me in the summer. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI ask this question because if it is one of the comorbidities for Covid-19 such as \nasthma, high blood pressure or diabetes, I would think an autoimmune disease \nwould be qualified as a comorbidity. Having said that, what funding is available \neither at the State or federal level to address this issue? The question is not if, \nbut  when  will  we  have  another  pandemic.  If  we  do  not  shore  up  those \ncommunities  that  are  more  susceptible  to  these  things,  we  will  see  more \ninfections and more deaths. What money is available at the State level, and \nwhat  has  come  in  for  Covid-19  relief  as  it  relates  to  medical  diagnosis  or \nprevention? Certainly lupus is a disease that mimics other diseases and puts \nindividuals at a greater risk of misdiagnosis or is paid for with people's lives. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe Covid-19 pandemic has shone a spotlight on the disproportionate impact on \nparts of our healthcare system for people of color. Asking for funds in this bill is \nmodest to address a specific disease that disproportionately affects women and \npeople of color. \n \nSection 7, subsection 3, states: \n \nThe State Board of Health shall by regulation adopt a schedule of \nfees which must be assessed to a healthcare facility for each case \nfrom which information is abstracted by the Division pursuant to \nsubsection 2. \n \nAre you committed to a fee structure where facilities pay part of the cost to \ncollect this information? If a General Fund appropriation was available, would \nthat suffice? As a sponsor of the bill, do you care how the funds are obtained? \nIs this an issue? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nSENATOR NEAL: \nIt is not an issue. To amend the bill without the fee would be a gamble. Would \nwe find the $112,000 going through the Senate Committee on Finance to fund \nthe mechanism, if the fee was removed? I do not care how it gets funded. If we \ndo this, we position ourselves for federal money that would become available in \nthe  future  to  help  the  research  and  establishment  of  a  system  to  report \ninformation  on  lupus  and  its  variants.  Right  now,  we  have  no  part  of  the \nlandscape of lupus, not our state next door to us, not the states around us. We \nwould be putting a step forward to say, at least in the western side of the \nUnited States, we want to help lupus patients. If you remove the fee structure \nand can find $112,000, I would be open to it. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIt seems like there is another fee in section 8, subsection 2, subparagraph (b), \nfor anyone who wants to perform research with the data. We are a policy \ncommittee, and we are focusing on the merits of the policy. Either way, it will \nbe forwarded to the Senate Committee on Finance for discussion if it comes out \nof our Committee. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI understand that $112,000 would be the cost for one full-time State employee \nwho will manage the registry, abstract and collect the data, and develop the \nreporting  structure.  Sections  5  and  6  of  the  bill  require  hospitals,  medical \nlaboratories and other facilities, and providers of health care to carry the bulk of \nthe financial burden. They will be trying to report the information on a reporting \nform  in  a  prescribed  manner  ensuring  it  is  compatible  with  HIPAA  so  that \nnames, ages and other data are not shared. It is problematic for the State and \nthe industry. There would be questions as to who reported data, who did not \nreport  data  and  when  it  was  done.  Looking  at  section  6,  subsection  2, \nsubparagraph (a), name, address, age and ethnicity of the patient are pretty \nsensitive things we are trying to figure out how to report and deal with. I have \nchallenges with the logistics. I do not feel as comfortable as I would like. How \ndo you do it? \n \nSENATOR NEAL: \nThe  information  on  patients  goes  from  the  care  facility  to  the  Division. \nSection 11 states, \"The Division shall not reveal the identity of any patient, \nphysician or health care facility.\" \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nSection 12, contains the confidentiality provision which states: \n \nA person or governmental entity that provides information to the \nDivision in accordance with sections 5, 6 and 7 of this act must \nnot be held liable in a civil or criminal action for sharing confidential \ninformation unless the person or organization has done so in bad \nfaith or with malicious purpose. \n \nThis language is similar to language in A.B. No. 254 of the 80th Session on \nsickle cell. These provisions in that bill passed the legislative process to make \nsure it is a two-way street between the provider and the Division, which is who \nwants  this  information  or  are  designated  in  this  legislation  to  get  this \ninformation. The language in section 11 is the same language as in the sickle \ncell bill signed by Governor Sisolak. There have been no confidentiality breaches \nwith the same exact language you see in sections 11 and 12. \n \nSAMANTHA WAYNE: \nI support S.B. 175. I have been living with lupus for 14 years. I cannot tell you \nhow many times doctors have been hesitant to treat me. I was forced to turn to \nmy rheumatologist who will not treat me for anything but my lupus. In 2017, I \nhad to go to the hospital for extreme chest pains and trouble breathing. I waited \nhours in a hospital bed before they decided to treat me with ibuprofen. It was \nclear to  me I was just another patient looking  for pain  meds rather than a \n24-year-old in extreme pain. Instead, I went home with temporary pain relief \nand a $700 hospital bill. \n \nIn 2018, I was in the hospital again after developing autoimmune hemolytic \nanemia, which is a rare blood disorder that can occur with lupus. My body was \nattacking my red blood cells, causing me to become dangerously ill. The doctors \nwere fearful of giving me a blood transfusion because the lupus would continue \nto attack the new blood cells; they were unsure how to treat me. I have been \nadvocating for lupus since I was 15. Early on, I saw the gap in treatment and \nawareness. It is important to improve the care of thousands of Nevadans living \nwith lupus every day by using research and data. \n \nTASHE PITTMAN: \nI support S.B. 175. I am a technical sergeant and retired veteran from Nellis Air \nForce  Base.  I  was  diagnosed  with  lupus  in  2015  and  have  been  a  medical \nmystery since 2004. I had symptoms of breaking out from the sun, allergic to \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nsunscreen, rapid heart rate and not knowing if I was having a stroke or heart \nattack. There are no doctors on base, so I was sent downtown. I have been in \nbetween doctors because most of the medical doctors for military people are \nmedical students, so most of the time my appointments are pushed downtown. \n \nThe problem I have noticed is when going to the ER I must have a referral from \na doctor and they have to state it is for lupus. However, they do not know \nexactly what my symptoms are, so most of the time, I get a diagnosis for my \nlupus and am told to see a rheumatologist. The research would be vital for \npeople in the military or people who do not know they have lupus and grow up \nfinding out they had lupus earlier in life. This information would be vital in \npassing this bill. \n \nSENATOR NEAL: \nSection 10 of this  bill would require DHHS to coordinate  with the  National \nLupus Patient Registry and include in the list of purposes for which DHHS must \napply for and accept any gifts, grants and donations. \n \nThe purpose of the amendment is to put DHHS in a position to use leverage to \npursue federal funds since DHHS is not part of the Lupus Registry. If DHHS \nbecomes part of the Registry and legislation is passed to start the surveillance \nprojects going on since 2004, DHHS can be in a position to start applying for \ngrants to help move this agenda forward around lupus patients. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThe  issue  is  about  the  money.  Is  it  possible  to  add,  \"as  money  becomes \navailable\"? Would this put DHHS in a position to pursue grants? \n \nSENATOR NEAL: \nI believe so as long as DHHS, in the back of the bill, was allowed to still go after \ngrants  and  donations.  I  have  seen  that  language  and  it  is  a  good  policy. \nHopefully, the Committee can find the support to get the policy out as a first \nstep forward for it to go to the Senate Committee on Finance to find money or \nprovide funds as they become available. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nPage 5, section 10, of the bill says the \"Division shall apply\". It directs the \nDHHS to apply for and accept any gifts, grants and donations specifically to \nsupport this project. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI did see where the bill directed DHHS to apply; however, it seems like the issue \nis money. I was trying to figure out a way to make sure the language in the bill \nis strong enough to survive, and then whatever gifts or grants are out there, \nDHHS can still go for them. If we have that opportunity, then money is not an \nissue. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe are a policy committee. We will make a decision based on the merits of the \npolicy.  Since  it  has  financial  implications,  if  the  bill  passes  out  of  our \nCommittee,  it  will  go  to  the  Finance  Committee  and  there  will  be  another \nopportunity for another conversation to talk about the money. We are focused \non policy in this Committee. We will not vote on the bill today. By legislative \nrules, there has to be some separation, typically, between the time you hear the \nbill and the time you vote on the bill.  \n \nI will now close the hearing on S.B. 175. The hearing on S.B. 251 is now open. \n \nSENATE BILL 251: Revises provisions relating to genetic counseling and testing. \n(BDR 40-478) \n \nSENATOR HEIDI SEEVERS GANSERT (Senatorial District No. 15): \nI am joined by Dr. Nathan Slotnick, who is a medical geneticist and high-risk \nobstetrician. He has been practicing and seeing patients in Nevada since 1990. \nIn 2005, he was asked to start a cancer genetics program by a local oncology \npractitioner group. He has also been part of a high-risk pregnancy practice with \nover 50,000 patients. He has been on the faculty at the University of Nevada, \nReno (UNR), School of Medicine and in 2020 was named medical director for \nreproductive  genetic  medicine  at  Invitae  Corporation.  I  am  also  joined  by \nAbbi Whitaker,  who  is  a  well-respected  and  award-winning  communications \nspecialist and entrepreneur. She and her husband founded the Abbi Agency \nwhose  tagline  reads  \"Where  Chutzpah  Meets  Acumen,\"  which  accurately \ndescribes her.  \n \nThis bill is about raising awareness and increasing appropriate screening for the \nmost  common  cause  of  heredity  breast  cancer.  This  would  be  inherited \nduplications of cancer genes also known as breast cancer gene (BRCA) 1 and \nBRCA 2, which Dr. Slotnick will cover. Ms. Whitaker will tell her story. Within \nthe  past  five  years,  I  have  six  friends  who  have  been  diagnosed  as \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nBRCA positive, including Ms. Whitaker. Dr. Slotnick will be able to explain the \nhigh risk of cancer if a person is BRCA positive. \n \nThe common thread with my friends is they have been fighting cancer for a \nwhile and many of them were diagnosed at an early age. The dots were never \nconnected to show they may have had a hereditary mutation. The reason it \nmatters if you have the BRCA genes is because women may have it as well as \ntheir children, because it is hereditary. My friends and a member of my family \nhave been affected by this and some have children who were born positive and \nsome negative. The key we need to remember is you have to be able to get a \nscreening and a referral for counseling and then testing. \n  \nROBERT  NATHAN  SLOTNICK,  M.D.,  PH.D.  (Director,  Medical  Genetics  and \nGenomics): \nI will be talking about an increasingly important component of cancer care; a \nsubset of medical genetics. We are what we are because of what we inherit \nfrom our parents. Genes are made of a chemical called DNA which is included \nwithin the cells of our body. All human adults have in their body approximately \n30 trillion cells. All of those cells are the result of many cell divisions from a \nsingle fertilized egg. Every time a cell divides, errors can occur. When those \nerrors occur, they can accumulate. If those errors accumulate in some of the \ncontrol genes of the cell, one of the possible results is cancer. I have included a \npresentation (Exhibit K) on Genetics and Cancer Technology which discusses in \ndetail information on cancer risks, BRCA 1 and BRCA 2, and genetic testing. In \nsummary, genetic testing identifies patients at risk and their families. There \nshould  be  a  discussion  of  family  history,  and  BRCA  testing  should  be \nencouraged. \n \nABBI WHITAKER: \nI am 45 years old and have tested positive for BRCA 2. I have been getting \nmammograms for the last five years and this year switched to Reno Diagnostic \nCenter. I filled out a questionnaire about my family history. When I went in for \nmy mammogram, I was told I had been flagged to potentially take a free genetic \ntest. A few weeks later, I was contacted by a genetic counselor who wanted to \nspeak with me about the tests. I got busy and did not call her back; however, \nshe kept leaving me messages so I finally called her as I thought it must be \nimportant. They told me I had tested positive for BRCA 2. I did not understand \nwhat this was and I did not know a lot about it. They told me it would increase \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nmy chances in my lifetime from 45 percent to 75 percent that I would develop \nbreast cancer and 45 percent for ovarian cancer. \n \nI am already a cancer survivor. I had anal cancer, with chemo and radiation, and \nnever was I flagged for this type of genetic testing or for BRCA. I go to the \ndoctor all the time for blood work, and you think they would have caught this. \nThankfully, the Reno Diagnostic Center decided to follow their policy and ask \nme those questions because now I know. I have eight brothers and sisters who \nare all now going through genetic testing to find out if they, too, have BRCA 1 \nor  BRCA  2.  I  have  ten  cousins  throughout  the  world  who  are  also  testing \nknowing this came from my father's side. \n \nI decided on April 15 to have a bilateral double mastectomy, followed by a \nhysterectomy. I am able to make this choice because Reno Diagnostic Center \nasked me some simple questions about my genetic history, and I was able to \nfind out I had the BRCA 2 gene. As women, mothers, senators, career women, \nwe  have  so  many  things  going  on  in  our  lives.  The  fact  I  now  have  this \nknowledge, can make a decision and make sure I do not die from this cancer is \nphenomenal. \n \nI approached Senator Seevers Gansert about informing and educating men and \nwomen  and  possibly  changing  the  law  for  more  cancer  screening.  Fighting \ncancer is not something we want to do. If we have the knowledge, we can stop \nit with my daughter and son, your daughter and your son. I think this is a \nwonderful opportunity. \n \nSENATOR SEEVERS GANSERT: \nI have a conceptual amendment (Exhibit L) stating the screening, counseling and \nreferral  for  testing  is  covered  under  preventive  services  based  on  the \nU.S. Preventive Services Task Force meaning the federal government covers \nthese services. Insurance carriers are required to cover the screening, referral for \ncounseling and potentially the testing. Section 1 requires primary care providers \nto screen women to determine if there is a family history indicating an increased \nrisk for a harmful mutation in the BRCA gene, and if the screening indicates an \nincreased risk, to take certain actions to ensure the woman receives genetic \ntesting and genetic counseling if testing positive for the gene. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nSection 2 of S.B. 251 describes the notice received with a mammogram which \nflags  a  person  for  genetic  testing.  Section  3  exempts  practitioners  from  a \ncategory D felony to a misdemeanor for any violation of section 1. \n \nAs was described by Dr. Slotnick, when you test positive for BRCA, the odds of \ngetting cancer are off the charts; as high as 87 percent in your lifetime. We \nneed to raise awareness and increase the screening so people know if they are \nat risk and take appropriate actions. It could be pharmaceuticals or surgery, but \nwhat we want to do is make sure people can stay as healthy as possible. \nMs. Whitaker mentioned her children, siblings and cousins are testing because it \nis a hereditary mutation. We should be testing when there is family history \nbecause it can save lives. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nI am appreciative of the exemption from the felony requirement. Is there any \nkind of stick to this carrot to encourage doctors to comply with the law? \n \nSENATOR SEEVERS GANSERT: \nThe requirement for health care providers to screen women for BRCA gene \nmutations and provide referrals for genetic counseling and testing is brand new. \nWhen you go to a physician, the doctor usually does a family history. It is about \nconnecting the dots. There are tools that have been developed and are being \ndeveloped to make it easy for practitioners to screen for BRCA and provide \nreferrals for genetic counseling and testing. I hope this bill strongly encourages \npractitioners. I have been talking with the medical association and practitioners \nabout trying to get this bill implemented. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nSections  8  through  11  address  continuing  education  credits  for  genetic \ninstruction.  Can these credits replace or be in lieu of suicide, pain management, \naddiction or the other requirements that physicians, whether M.D. or D.O., have \na responsibility for? \n \nSENATOR SEEVERS GANSERT: \nIt  is  not  a  replacement,  it  allows  these  credits  to  count.  There  are  certain \ncategories that are required, but there are more continuing medical education \nrequirements than are categorized. It is a choice an individual can make to get \ncredit for completing a course relating to genetic counseling and testing. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe way the language in the bill reads, it looks like it could replace or be in lieu \nof those other requirements. Is that not your intent? \n \nSENATOR SEEVERS GANSERT: \nThe intent is not to replace; it is to make it an option. There are certain required \ncategories, but genetic instruction would be an acceptable category to fulfil part \nof the entire number of continuing education requirements that are in statute. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nRight now, I do not know of anything that would preclude you from counting \ngenetic hours. \n \nTOM CLARK (Nevada Association of Health Plans): \nWe support S.B. 251.  \n \nCARI HERINGTON (Executive Director, Nevada Cancer Coalition): \nWe support S.B. 251. \n \nGEORGE ROSS (Comprehensive Cancer Centers of Nevada): \nWe support S.B. 251.  \n \nMARIAN GANSERT: \nI support S.B. 251. My story is similar to Ms. Whitaker. I was never flagged \nduring the course of my breast cancer history. It started 36 years ago when I \nwas diagnosed with breast cancer and had a mastectomy on my left side. I was \n30 years old and was told not much was known about breast cancer at the \ntime. Years later, I decided to be proactive and have a preventative mastectomy \non my right side. In 2015, I went to my annual gynecology appointment and \nwas told I was eligible for genetic testing. My test came back positive. I was \nthen told the BRCA 2 gene had a 50 percent chance of developing into ovarian \ncancer and a 90 percent chance of developing into breast cancer. Two months \nlater, I had a total hysterectomy. Since I also had two mastectomies, I thought I \nwas doing great. It did not turn out that way. \n \nIn 2017, I was diagnosed with cancer on my preventative mastectomy side. I \nguess a piece of breast tissue had been left behind. I had both my children \ntested and they tested negative. To my knowledge, my mother never had breast \ncancer. I do not know of anyone on my mother or father's side having breast \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \ncancer. I have a granddaughter who will be born in May, and in the back of my \nmind, this baby will eventually have to be tested for the BRCA gene. \n \nKENDAHL SERVINO: \nI support S.B. 251. I am a medical student at UNR and breast cancer survivor. I \nwas diagnosed at 20 years of age; it was the biggest shock of my life and the \nhardest  struggle  I  ever  had  to  face.  I  received  chemo,  radiation  and  a  few \nsurgeries while finishing up my last semester of college. Losing my hair and my \nconfidence and becoming unable to recognize myself in the mirror were the \nhardest parts of treatment for me. I hope none of you will ever experience or \nhave to face breast cancer. I come here today to share the importance of BRCA \ngenetic testing and having this bill passed. The number of lives that will be \nsaved by passing this bill will be tremendous.  \n \nMARLENE LOCKHARD (Nevada Women's Lobby): \nWe support S.B. 251. This bill can and will save lives. \n \nERIN LYNCH (Social Services Chief, Division of Health Care Financing and Policy, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nWe are neutral on this bill. Nevada Medicaid covers genetic screening, testing \nand counseling for BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 for both men and women. There is a \nzero dollar fiscal note on this bill. \n \nROBBIN PALMER, PH.D (Certified Genetic Counselor): \nI am neutral on this bill and have several concerns about this legislation even \nthough it is well intentioned. I am the only practicing genetics professional in \nnorthern Nevada. I have provided written testimony (Exhibit M). \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nI was reviewing the bill again and want to note a violation of section 1 would \nstill be a misdemeanor. If it is your intention to take away all penalties, you may \nwant to draft another amendment to exempt it as well. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe had the testimony from Medicaid. There is no fiscal note because these are \nservices already available for almost everybody in the Medicaid population. You \ntestified earlier we are already doing this with insurance companies, and it is \npart of federal law and part of the essential benefits included in the Affordable \nCare Act by reference to preventive services. Is this your understanding? \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \nSENATOR SEEVERS GANSERT: \nYes. It is part of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations \nwhich is what is relied upon for preventive services. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWhy  have  the  insurance  components  in  the  bill  if  Medicaid  and  insurance \ncompanies are already providing these services? \n \nSENATOR SEEVERS GANSERT: \nIn speaking with the Legislative Counsel Bureau's Legal Division, I learned if we \nwere able to put this in the bill, then we would preserve the coverage even if it \nwere changed at a federal level. We want to make sure Nevadans have access \nto this counseling and testing, and this is why we want it in statute. \n \nThe federal government covers BRCA 1 and BRCA 2, and genetic medicine will \nbe refined over the years. There are genetic mutations which we know can be \nlethal, and I want to have testing for those. If we can get testing for BRCA 1 \nand BRCA 2, and you look at the pie charts provided by Dr. Slotnick, you can \nsee the magnitude of how many people can potentially test positive and what \nthe outcomes can be. \n \nWe  do  not  have  enough  genetic  counselors,  but  what  we  do  have  are \nphysicians and practitioners who can learn more about genetics. We do not \nhave licensure as we are not at that level. Once people test positive, they are \ngoing  to  have  relationships  with  their  practitioners  to  make  decisions.  The \ndecisions may be they go on birth control or have a mastectomy, but those \ndecisions can be made between a patient and a physician. Making sure we have \npeople screened is extremely important. We can save a lot of lives with this \nlegislation. \n \n \n   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe  hearing  on  S.B.  251  is  now  closed.

(BDR 38-397) \n \nZACH CONINE (State Treasurer): \nAssembly Bill  62  helps  to  innovate  and  strengthen  the  Nevada  Achieving  a \nBetter  Life  Experience  (ABLE)  Savings  Program  to  ensure  Nevadans  with \ndisabilities have the opportunity to save for a better future. \n \nBroadly speaking, ABLE accounts are tax-advantaged saving accounts that allow \npeople with disabilities to earn and save money without losing access to vital \nbenefit  programs  like  Medicaid  and  Social  Security.  These  tax-free  savings \naccounts are made available to individuals to cover qualified disability-related \nexpenses such as education, housing and transportation. This program aims to \nease the financial burden faced by people with disabilities who are the most \nunderemployed demographic group in our State. \n \nIn  the  2019  Legislative  Session,  our  Office  worked  with \nAssemblywoman Lesley E.  Cohen  from  Assembly  District  No.  29  and  the \nDivision  of  Aging  and  Disability  Services  of  the  Department  of  Health  and \nHuman Services (DHHS) to pass A. B. No. 130 of the 80th Session. This bill \nmoved the entire ABLE Savings Program into the State Treasurer’s Office. Since \nthat time, our Office has worked with hundreds of Nevadans with disabilities \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nand their families to ensure access to these accounts without any impact on the \nState’s General Fund.  \n \nThe provisions of A.B. 62 would make Nevada the first State in the Country to \nfind  innovative  ways  to  incentivize  people  with  disabilities  to  open  these \naccounts  and  build  account  balances  to  ensure  all  Nevadans  have  the \nopportunity to save money and earn a living regardless of their abilities.  \n \nERIK JIMENEZ (Senior Deputy State Treasurer): \nWhen  we  took  over  this  program  from  the  Division  of  Aging  and  Disability \nServices,  there  were  under  200  accounts;  we  now  have  1,100  to \n1,200 accounts with zero dollars from the General Fund. This program has been \ninstrumental in changing lives for every person who opens an account.  \n \nThere are asset and resource limits based on certain programs for Medicaid, \nSocial Security and State disability services that prohibit a person from saving, \nearning  a  living  and  providing  a  pathway  out  of  poverty  for  people  with \ndisabilities.  People  who  qualify  for  ABLE  savings  accounts  are  those  with \ndevelopmental and intellectual disabilities, long-term disabilities that significantly \nhinder one’s ability to live life.  \n \nThis bill is a simple bill but an impactful one. I speak with families on a daily \nbasis to set up accounts. The biggest barrier to opening an account is that the \nperson,  guardian  or  caregiver  does  not  have  the  initial  funds  to  open  the \naccount. Right now, it takes $25 to $50 to open an account. Because the \nperson is on a fixed income one oftentimes does not have the extra resources to \nopen the account.  \n \nThis bill would allow us to seek federal grants, donations and other sources of \nfunds to establish a method similar to what we do for the Nevada College Kick \nStart Savings Program to incentivize the opening of an account. To make this \nwork, we would craft regulations allowing someone to open an account with an \ninitial contribution from $50 to $100 depending how much we can raise in \nfederal funds, gifts, grants or donations. \n \nThe  next  step  for  this  bill  is  finding  resources  for  the  program,  perhaps  in \nanother legislative session if appropriate for a General Fund appropriation, to \nencourage people to maximize their savings and develop regular savings habits \nby incentivizing them through matching contributions. The College Kick Start \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nSavings Program gives $50 to every kindergartener in Nevada. If we replicate a \nsimilar model, we could see a lot of success. \n \nCONNOR CAIN (Nevada Bankers Association): \nThe Nevada Bankers Association supports A.B. 62 as an innovative bill that \nwould  make  Nevada  the  first  State  in  the  Country  to  strengthen  its  ABLE \nSavings Program by accepting gifts, grants and donations.  \n \nBAILEY BORTOLIN (Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers): \nThe Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers offers our support of A.B. 62. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 62 and open the hearing on S.B. 188. \n \nSENATE BILL 188: Establishes programs for certain persons of low-income and \npersons in foster care. (BDR 38-711) \n \nSENATOR PAT SPEARMAN (Senatorial District No. 1): \nAccording to Prosperity Now, in 2021 nearly 13 percent of Nevadans have \nincomes below the federal poverty level. That is $12,880 for an individual and \n$26,500  per  year  for  a  family.  In  addition,  credit  and  debt  are  significant \nproblems.  Nearly  one  in  three  consumer’s  credit  card  debt  is  more  than \n75 percent of his or her total credit limit. One in four Nevadans has an account \nin collections. This information, although current, does not take into account the \nfinancial abyss most of our neighbors are in due to the Covid-19 pandemic. \n \nCredit and debt issues can lead to other harmful financial decisions, such as \nrelying too heavily on alternative or predatory financial products. Approximately \none in four Nevada households is considered underbanked. This means despite \nhaving a checking or savings account, they rely on nonbank alternative financial \nservices like check cashers, payday lenders or pawn shops to make ends meet. \n \nSenate Bill 188 aims to help low-income Nevadans accumulate assets, become \nmore  financially  literate  and  achieve  specific  financial  goals.  This  legislation \nseeks to bring hope and opportunity to low-income, low-wealth Nevadans by \ncreating  the  Individual  Development  Accounts  (IDA)  Program.  Qualifying \nresidents will be able to save and grow their money through matching funds to \nenhance their financial security. The IDA Program will provide those who need \nhelp, the most opportunity to save money toward secondary education, starting \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \na new business, purchasing a home or investing in other categories. Enhanced \nfinancial  capabilities  will  enable  IDA  participants  to  improve  their  overall \nfinancial  well-being  and  build  a  foundation  for  continued  economic  growth, \nrealizing a new level of security in difficult times. \n \nThe inception of the bill is from a time when we lived in the projects. You could \nnot  earn  more  than  a  specific  amount  of  money  or  you  would  lose  your \neligibility. You could not have a car that was two years old. Most of that has \nnot changed. The social service programs are not designed to give people a \nhand up, but rather to create generational poverty. This bill came out of a desire \nto say those who are in public or assisted housing need an opportunity to save \nwithout losing their eligibility or social services.  \n \nI asked the question, what happens when a child in foster care turns 18 years \nof age? The answer was they are out of the system. Does this mean the child is \nout the system in 30 days a year? I cannot imagine being an 18 year old who \nhas had a childhood totally in the foster care system, was never adopted or \ntaken in as a foster child, or spent time in four or five different households. Now \nyou are on your own and you have nothing. Senate Bill 188 answers the moral \nimperative; how will we help those who are the least among us? \n \nAt a high level, the bill provides for the establishment of the IDA Program in \nNevada.  The  program  is  based  on  a  similar  initiative  in  Oregon. \nSections 15 through  25  require  the  Office  of  the  State  Treasurer  to  solicit \ngrants, gifts and donations to carry out the program and establish the program if \nsufficient funds are obtained. This is predicated on having the funds to get this \nprogram started.  \n \nSection  20  authorizes  the  Office  of  State  Treasurer  to  select  one  or  more \nfiduciary organizations to administer the funds in the program and distribute a \nportion of the funds to the DHHS foster care licensing agencies and housing \nauthorities  to  provide  instruction  in  financial  literacy  to  account  holders. \nWherever people are, there is no wrong door. If they are in subsidized housing, \nfoster care, wherever they are, they have access to financial literacy courses \nthat will help them not only get out of poverty but help them save so they can \nremain well-sufficient for the rest of their lives. \n \nSection 21 provides qualifying criteria to be an account holder. Specifically, a \nperson must be a resident of Nevada. The account holders must be 12 years of \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nage or older to ensure we get children in the foster care system young enough \nso their IDA Program can grow. At the age of 18 they would have enough \nmoney to be financially secure when they age out of the system. The account \nholders must also be tenants living in government subsidized housing in Nevada, \nMedicaid recipients or foster care providers who create accounts for children in \ntheir care. \n \nThe bill helps account holders’ balances grow because for every dollar deposited \ninto the account, the fiduciary organizations deposit up to $5 in matching funds \nproviding there are funds available. This is for $3,000 deposited into an account \nin any 12-month period.  \n \nSections  2,  36  and  38  prohibit  Medicaid,  local  housing  authorities  and  the \nNevada  Rural  Housing  Authority,  respectively,  from  considering  the  funds \ndeposited into IDAs to be income when determining a person’s eligibility for the \nrespective programs. This is designed specifically to help people who are in \ngovernment-subsidized housing to help foster children be financially stable when \nthey turn 18 years of age.  \n \nOftentimes, people would like to purchase a house but are in a program that \nstates they cannot have more than $1,000 per year in the bank. Most down \npayments are $5,000. If you can never save that, you will always be in that \nhousing situation. For foster care children, the foster parents can set it up, but \nthis account is for the foster child, not a bank for the foster family. \n \nSections  5  through  14  create  the  Nevada  Statewide  Council  on  Financial \nIndependence. The Council is responsible for developing Statewide priorities and \nstrategies  to  help  people  who  receive  public  assistance  or  social  services \nincrease their financial independence, coordinate with certain state agencies and \noversee the IDA Program if it is established. \n \nSection  33  requires  the  State  Treasurer  ensure  instruction  and  training  in \nbusiness opportunities, and any benefits available to certain business enterprises \nare provided to tenants of local housing authorities, the Nevada Rural Housing \nAuthority  and  certain  nonprofit  organizations.  To  help  the  State  Treasurer \naccomplish the goals in S.B. 188, section 32 authorizes the Office of the State \nTreasurer to appoint and employ a Deputy of Financial Literacy and Security.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nGoing into the pandemic, many Nevadans were barely holding on. In 2019, \nVice President  Kamala  Harris  said  most  households  with  a  $400  emergency \nwould most likely fall off the financial cliff and not be able to easily recover. For \nso  many  people  who  were  working  and  self-sufficient,  and  to  an  extent \nfinancially independent, this pandemic has brought them to their knees. Many \npeople had a home and lost it or were renting with the hope of purchasing a \nhome, which is no longer a reality. We are looking at people who desire to be \nother than where they are in the social strata. We have a moral obligation to \nmake sure people who are in public or subsidized housing can save to purchase \na home or start a small business and employ others. For children in foster care, \nonce they age out, the best thing we can do for them is help them save so \nwhen they do turn 18 years of age, they will understand how to use money, not \nabuse it.  \n \nThe  IDA  Program  is  designed  to  teach  people  how  to  become  financially \nindependent. It is not a handout, it is a hand up. We are told to lift ourselves up \nby the bootstraps. Some people do not have boots—some barely have socks. If \nthe litmus test is how quickly you can lift yourself up, there are some among us \nwho will never be able to do that. This is an opportunity for them to do just \nthat.  \n \nTREASURER CONINE: \nAs Senator Spearman stated, IDAs are matched savings accounts that allow \nresidents with lower income to save for defined goals without losing access to \nessential programs like Medicaid and low-income housing services. Throughout \nthe Country, IDAs have helped to increase financial literacy and management \nskills for people in disadvantaged communities while helping to build pathways \nout of poverty. Looking at IDA Programs around the Country, participants are \n35 percent more likely to own a home, twice as likely to attend an institution of \nhigher learning and 84 percent more likely to start a business.  \n \nIn the State Treasurer’s Office, we manage the Nevada ABLE Savings Program \nthat allows people differently abled to save money without losing access to \nmuch needed benefits. Senate Bill 188 would further that work to help groups \ngain access to financial vehicles they need to advance their economic mobility.  \n \nIn the State of the State Address, Governor Steve Sisolak emphasized how the \nimportance in increasing Nevada’s share of federal grant funding will play a part \nin our economic recovery. By directing our Office to work collaboratively with \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nthe DHHS, we identified sources of grant funding necessary to ensure Nevada’s \nlower income residents have the tools they need to be a major part of our \neconomic recovery. \n \nIn addition to bringing more federal dollars back to Nevada, we can also work to \ncreate  the  vital  savings  option  tenants  of  low-income  housing,  Medicaid \nrecipients and foster youth across Nevada need. \n \nMR. JIMENEZ: \nForty-two states have an IDA program in some shape or form. Typically, how \nthese programs work is a state entity, board, commission or agency will work \nwith a network of nonprofits which are defined as fiduciaries under the bill. To \nadminister, market and do outreach for these programs, IDA contributions set \nup by an individual are then matched to a specific dollar amount. We are trying \nto figure out how we can help an individual save for a defined goal, such as \neducation, housing or purchasing a new car to help the person get to work, \nmaking those dollars go further. If we allow the money from the contributor \nonly,  those  dollars  do  not  go  as  far.  The  State  has  oversight  over  those \naccounts  like  our  Office  would  with  any  other  program  we  have.  Those \nnonprofit fiduciaries help provide financial literacy services to the individuals \nwith those accounts.  \n \nPre- and post-pandemic low-income individuals have struggled, especially with \nthe effects of Covid-19. The State needs to develop a body or framework to \nmake  sure  we  can  help  individuals  develop  strategies  and  have  the  tools \nnecessary  to  achieve  financial  independence.  We  can  all  agree  that  helping \nsomeone save and get out of poverty is important.  \n \nA number of states use different vehicles to fund IDAs. Approximately 10 states \nuse General Fund for their programs, and 15 use Temporary Assistance for \nNeedy Families funds to support the programs. Five states use their Community \nDevelopment Block Grant funds and two states use housing trust funds. There \nis potential for federal vehicles to help get this program off the ground. \n \nLAWRENCE WEEKLY (Former Clark County Commissioner): \nI support S.B. 188. I am a native Nevadan born into the system as a newborn \nand at two days old was turned over to the foster care system. Because of the \nState of Nevada and the village concept, there were social workers who cared \nfor me when I did not have a family to call my own. It was not until I became a \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nClark County Commissioner that I saw my original birth certificate for the first \ntime.  This  put  me  into  counseling.  There  was  no  first  name  on  the  birth \ncertificate. As a grown adult male, this devastated me realizing I came into the \nworld with no identity.  \n \nMany young people have gone through this traumatic system. They did not ask \nto be born into this world and have been tossed from household to household \nnot receiving parental love. The joy of having a child, and that child being able \nto look into his or her parents face knowing this is genuine love is something I \ndid not experience until I was 11 months old when taken out of the system.  \n \nI was not traumatized or abused. I had two loving parents who could not have \ntheir own child, and I was adopted by them. I did not find out I was adopted \nuntil  I  was  almost  a  teenager.  This  is  where  my  life  became  whole. \nUnfortunately, my parents divorced when I was seven years old. My mother \nwas forced to go on government assistance because of the abuse she endured.  \n \nI  am  currently  in  a  doctoral  program  writing  my  paper  on  aged-out  foster \nchildren. As I do my research, I hear stories from children aging out of the \nsystem finding themselves sleeping under freeways and bridges or on top of \nroofs to stay safe. They eat out of garbage cans because they have no place to \ncall their own and do not know where their next meal will come from.  \n \nIf we can provide at least one more opportunity, one more resource for a child \nwho has probably not received the tools necessary he or she would need to go \nout into the world, this would be another feather in the cap for Nevada. This \nwould show that we as Nevadans do care. I am a prime example of what \nhappens when people are provided the necessary resources.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe  work  hard  in  this  Committee  to  destigmatize  mental  health  and  mental \nhealth treatment. I was adopted at five days old and have my birth certificate \nfrom Washoe County that states I was born in a house in Washoe County. I \nwas  one  of  the  lucky  ones  to  be  adopted  by  parents  who  have  been \nphenomenal in my life and know that not all children are as lucky as I was. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI have a question on setting up a supervisory entity. Is that in the State purview \nor do we create a new entity? Are the $3,000 of matching funds ever taxed \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nwhen  taken  out  of  the  account?  Who  is  the  donor,  and  if  the  donor  is \nincentivized to donate, does the donor receive a tax write-off of some kind? \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nWe had three-to-one match from the General Fund last Session when the bill \nwas introduced. This Session we took that out and added the language “to the \nextent that money is available.” In terms of being incentivized, there is not a \ntime  I  have  watched  television  and  not  seen  a  commercial  for  St.  Jude’s \nChildren’s Hospital or someone asking for money for abused animals. People \nwho see the worth  of this can and will donate,  especially in light  of what \nhappened in the pandemic. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI do not believe these funds are tax-deferred so should not be taxable when \nwithdrawn.  \n \nMR. JIMENEZ: \nThat is the case. There are some federal statutes governing IDAs. I will check \non this and get back to the Committee. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nAre the matching funds, which would be five-to-one, matched by donations \nwhere funds are available through gifts, grants and donations?  \n \nWhen a tenant moves from low-income housing, do they no longer have the \nopportunity to have matching funds added to the IDA? \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThe  vision  of  the  program  is  for  people  in  subsidized  housing,  living  in  a \nlow-wealth community who would like to purchase a home but do not have \naccess to the program and do not know how to save for the money. If they did \nknow,  it  would  be  counted  against  their  eligibility  either  for  Medicaid  or \nlow-income housing. This program is for people in that situation. Once they \nreceive  the  money  needed  for  a  down  payment  on  a  home  or  to  start  a \nbusiness, they are no longer eligible for Medicaid or low-income housing. This is \nthe purpose for offering classes on financial literacy, to help them get to a place \nwhere they can live their dream while understanding how to use money and not \nlet money use them. This will help lift people out of the situation they are in. \nWe want to help the situation so the destination will be better. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIf children are 12 years old and move out of the tenant or housing project when \n15 or 16 and they keep the account until they need the funds, are they no \nlonger eligible to receive the matching funds specifically designed for them in \ntheir IDA program? \n \nMR. JIMENEZ: \nSenator  Hardy,  you  had  mentioned  the  entity  to  manage  the  program.  In \nprograms such as savings programs or retirement savings, the details of the \nentity to manage the program are regulations that are promulgated through the \nboard. We want to ensure we have flexibility.  \n \nThe intention now is no General Fund dollars are to be used. However, it could \nbe  from  private  philanthropy  or  through  federal  dollars.  The  program  is \ninteresting in that it is flexible for recipients of Medicaid, low-income housing \nand foster youth. We might find a bucket of federal funding we could use for \none  of  those  populations  but  not  others.  If  we  find  funding  specifically  for \ntenants  of  low-income  housing,  we  could  partner  with  a  nonprofit  offering \nservices to those tenants and make sure we could rightsize the program to meet \nthose needs.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWhen people have been living in low-income housing and moved out, or have \nbeen on Medicaid and now they are not, do they go in and out of eligibility to \nparticipate? Once they are anchored in, can they continue to participate? \n \nMR. JIMENEZ: \nIn the circumstance you described, there may be a need for some regulatory \nclarification. The money saved and matched while a person was eligible for the \nprogram would follow that person. I am not sure if the person was no longer \nreceiving  Medicaid  or  living  in  subsidized  or  low-income  housing  the  match \ncould occur after that point. \n \nTREASURER CONINE: \nThere are comparable examples in some of our 529 College Savings Plans which \nhave matches based on income. That match goes away if the person or family \ngoes over an income line for a time but the underlying 521 Exempt Asset does \nnot. If the family went out of eligibility and then back in, they would again \nqualify for the match. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nSection  20  charges  the  State  Treasurer  to  solicit  funds  for  the  matching \npayments by a fiduciary institution. Section 25 states the fiduciary organization \nhas the sole authority and responsibility for the administration of the IDAs, and \nthe  responsibility  of  the  fiduciary  organization  extends  to  all  aspects of  the \nprogram including soliciting matching funds. Who does what? It appears the \nprogram, in section 25, is totally turned over to the fiduciary organization. What \nis the role of the State Treasurer at that point? \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nSection 25 states “subject to any regulations adopted by the State Treasurer”. \nYour question is one that will be considered when they are in the regulation \nwriting portion of this program. It is not that responsibility turns over but is \nsubject to any regulation adopted by the State Treasurer.  \n \nMR. JIMENEZ: \nIn other states, the nonprofit fiduciary does a lot of the leg work. You do bring \nup a good point on asset oversight and management. If that is something you \nwould like to see in section 25, we could clarify that to ensure the State is \nserving some sort of advisory or oversight rule. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nDo the funds deposited into the bank accounts specifically go to a financial \ninstitution? \n \nMR. JIMENEZ: \nYes. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nCan you give an example of the type of nonprofit that service these programs? \n \nMR. JIMENEZ: \nOur community nonprofits that provide a number of services could service the \nprogram. It is difficult now as we are not authorized to do that as a State, so \nwe do not have nonprofits that are currently doing this work. In other states, \nyou will see if there is a nonprofit that specifically provides services to newly \nmade citizens. If it could operate an IDA for the population it serves whether a \nhousing  coalition,  a  homelessness  prevention  group  or  an  eligible  nonprofit \nserving foster youth. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThe basic criteria is that the nonprofit status is in accordance with Internal \nRevenue Service 501(c)(3) regulations. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nNonprofits have a difficult time raising money now. What type of process is \nthere to ensure they have matching funds? What happens if they sign people up \nand they cannot raise the funds for a match? \n \nMR. JIMENEZ: \nThere is a section of the bill that requires the State Treasurer to determine, in \nconsultation with the board, who qualifies to be a fiduciary organization. When \nwe talk about matching funds as contemplated under this bill, they are limited \nto the availability of funding brought in through federal or grant funding. We \nwould have to do an analysis of how much funding we anticipate bringing in \nand scale the program appropriately to ensure it would not run out of matching \nfunds.  \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIn the bill, it is not the State Treasurer’s responsibility to raise the matching \nfunds, it is the responsibility of the fiduciary. If ten accounts are created and \nthey can only fund five based on the money they have raised, who is held \naccountable and what accounts get shorted? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSection 20 of the bill reads that it is the role of the Office of the State Treasurer \nto solicit and apply for gifts, grants or donations to the extent that sufficient \nfunds are obtained, establish the program and authorize a certain number of \naccounts based on the funds obtained. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nYes, however, section 25 gives the power or sole authority to the fiduciary \norganizations. The administration of the accounts and the responsibility of the \nfiduciary organization extends to all aspects of the program including, without \nlimitation, soliciting matching funds as shown in subsection 1, subparagraph (b). \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe  may  be  struggling  with  the  mechanics  of  how  this  would  work. \nUnderstanding regulatory processes will bring clarity, and it cannot contradict \nwhat is actually in the bill. Can this be addressed today? \n \nMR. JIMENEZ: \nI agree there is some conflicting language and it would make sense for us to \ncome  back  with  an  amendment  to  clarify  the  language  regarding  rules  and \nresponsibilities. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs your intent that the State Treasurer’s Office approves a specific number of \nslots and the fiduciary manages those slots? \n \nMR. JIMENEZ: \nCorrect. If it were the reverse, you could run into a situation where you may \nhave created too many accounts and not be able to find a potential match. The \nmatch is not set, it can vary from $1 to $5. It is not guaranteed that every \naccount created would get a $5 match. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe match is set based on a predetermined agreement between the account \nholder and fiduciary. The fiduciary does not get to vary how much it deposits \nonce a month if it is a fixed amount. \n \nMR. JIMENEZ: \nFor the long-term sustainability of the program, it would have to be a fixed \namount. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThe regulatory process, and all other processes associated with this, will be \ndone with the State Treasurer’s oversight. Part of the clarity we might achieve \nwith an amendment is to make sure we identify what those are and how it \nrelates to each section of the bill. The fiduciary does not start the process, it is \nthe State Treasurer who is the overseer or chair of the financial board, and the \nLieutenant  Governor,  or  their  designee,  is  the  vice  chair.  Nothing  happens \nwithout the approval of the State Treasurer. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nOn the list of items the account can be created for, does it have to be specific \ngoing in, or is it a general account that can be used for any of these purposes? \n \nMR. JIMENEZ: \nThe  bill  specifically  states  it  can  be  used  for  postsecondary  education,  job \ntraining, purchasing or renting a home, starting a business and various other \nuses. I have seen this done both ways, and this is something the board will \nhave  to  weigh  in  on.  One  way  is  similar  to  how  we  would  operate  an \nABLE savings account as long as it meets any of the qualifying expenses. In \nother states, the person must set a defined goal going in, such as saving for the \npurchase of a house or a car, and then that is what it would be used for. How \nthe language is drafted does not make a decision either way, but I have seen it \ndone both ways. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe way I read it, the initial agreement with the fiduciary had to be set up for a \nspecific purpose that included one of these purposes. A statement of intent \nabout what you are planning would be beneficial. In section 22, subsection 2, \nparagraph (m) referencing the payment of medical expenses; sometimes medical \nexpenses are not anticipated. We need clarity over that because the way it was \ndescribed,  you  would  use  part  of  the  program  for  financial  literacy  and \neducation to accomplish the goal of why you started the program, and then exit \nthe  program.  This  seems  to  be  more  of  a  rolling  account  which  serves  a \ndifferent purpose. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI am interested in your experience with these programs in other states. It would \nbe ideal if these accounts would not affect any existing benefits someone may \nbe receiving. For many of our benefits there is an asset test. I am curious as to \nwhether we know these do not impinge on the benefits someone may have. If \nsomeone  is  in  affordable  housing,  which  can  be  such  a  critical  linchpin  for \nlong-term success, the establishment of one of these accounts does not put the \nperson at risk for losing this benefit. How are we getting around that when \nmost of those rules are set by the federal government? \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThe bill states the entities that provide the services shall not count that against \nsomeone’s eligibility. It also states it is subject to federal regulations. If the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nfederal  government  says  you  cannot  have  more  than  $2,000  in  a  specific \naccount, we cannot go over and above that amount. We have been asked why \nthis amount is so low. We took into consideration what the regulations are now \nat  the  federal  level  and  tried  to  say  we  would  not  go  above  that  amount \nresulting in the $3,000 limit. I had considered $3,500 but need to make sure it \ndoes not get close to the federal government amount.  \n \nThe amount of other money raised will have to be predicated on making sure it \ndoes not cause anyone to lose benefits according to the federal government. \nThere are things the housing authority and the Nevada Rural Housing Authority \nneed to check on to ensure the amount does not go above their eligibility limit. \nThis is the vision, but we also know we have to walk in step with the federal \ngovernment.  \n \nI have been on a crusade talking to our federal delegation trying to explain to \nthem the federal system is not designed to help people move out of poverty. As \nlong as people cannot have a bank account with over and above a certain \namount of money or a car that is less than so many years old, you will always \nhave generation after generation experiencing poverty because they cannot save \nmoney. In many cases, even if they could save they do not know where to go \nto get the financial literacy they need.  \n \nBETH HANDLER, M.H.P. (Deputy Director, Programs, Department of Health and \nHuman Services): \nIn our agency analysis, the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services that \ndecides Medicaid eligibility found no impact and would be good to go with the \nlanguage as written. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWho gets chosen for how much money goes into these individual accounts? Is \nit equitable to everyone, or can the donor direct the funds to just foster care or \nsingle parents of children, or can an individual direct money to his or her own \naccount and have the donation matched? How is it directed to the individual? \n \nTREASURER CONINE: \nDepending on the source of the funds, it may go to a specific group. If you \nwere to get a grant to help support the well-being of individuals in foster care, it \nmay  be  specifically  for  that  segment  of  IDA  accounts.  If  we  got  a  federal \nCommunity Reinvestment Act grant from a bank, or an individual wanted to add \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nfunds,  or  as  we  do  with  anyone  wanting  to  fund  a  program,  the  State \nTreasurer’s Office works with the grantor on what is wanted to ensure we \nmake it equitable and managed appropriately. Those decisions would be made \non a board and grantor level. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThere must be some kind of understanding where the funds go, otherwise it \nbecomes arbitrary. \n \nTREASURER CONINE: \nThe source of the funds help to determine where it will go. You want to ensure \nthat it is equitable when the funds come in, especially those from gifts or grants \nas opposed to General Fund dollars. In terms of gifts and grants, the grantors \nshould have an opinion on where those funds go. If they are committed to the \nsupportive care for individuals in the foster care system, we want to ensure \ntheir dollars went to support those IDA accounts. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWhat you are describing could be a tax write-off for the grantor. \n \nTREASURER CONINE: \nThat is possible. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nCan an individual donate to his own savings account, and if so, get matching \ndollars into that account? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThat is the foundational concept. Every matching dollar is a match to a gift the \nowner of the account adds. Account holders do not get any matching donations \nunless they make a donations.  \n \nMR. CAIN: \nThe Nevada Bankers Association supports S.B. 188. I echo Senator Spearman’s \nremarks in stressing the importance of helping low-income Nevadans and other \nvulnerable  members  of  our  community  accumulate  assets,  become  more \nfinancially  literate  and  achieve  their  financial  goals.  Having  a  few  hundred \ndollars in your bank account can make all the difference in the world when the \nunexpected happens.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nMS. BORTOLIN: \nAt  Washoe  Legal  Services  and  Legal  Aid  Center  of  Southern  Nevada,  we \nprovide attorneys to children in foster care for the cases they are involved in. \nFrom that aspect and as an advocate for those children, the Nevada Coalition of \nLegal Service Providers supports S.B. 188. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThank you for considering what I believe will be a monumental step forward in \nhelping those who are in public or subsidized housing and children in the foster \ncare system.  \n \nThere is an African proverb that says, “It takes a whole village to raise a child.” \nI would add, “It takes a whole child to raise another village.” \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 188 and open the hearing on S.B. 205. \n \nSENATE  BILL  205:  Provides  regulatory  exemptions  for  certain  types  of \nresidential and commercial boilers. (BDR 40-839) \n \nSENATOR MOISES DENIS (Senatorial District No. 2): \nSenate  Bill  205  addresses  an  oversight  that  occurred  when  emergency \nregulations were adopted last year by the Division of Industrial Relations (DIR) \nof the Department of Business and Industry.  \n \nIn adopting regulations related to boilers, the Division exempted certain gas fire \nresidential  and  commercial  tank  water  heaters  but  unintentionally  failed  to \nexempt similar tankless water heaters. The result is that tankless water heaters \nare  now  subject  to  significantly  more  onerous  regulations  than  similar  tank \nheaters and are more stringent than necessary to ensure public safety. The goal \nof this bill is to seek parity in statutory regulation of tank and tankless water \nheaters so this type of regulatory error is not repeated. \n \nWe worked with the DIR and there is a proposed amendment (Exhibit B) to \nclarify the intent of the bill and address certain concerns raised by the Division. \n \nWARREN HARDY (Rinnai America Corporation): \nThis  bill  corrects  an  oversight  created  last  year,  as  noted  in  my  memo \n(Exhibit C). This issue is something we have spoken about with our competitors, \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nthe construction industry and others impacted by this regulatory oversight with \nbroad support. \n \nThe  proposed  amendment,  Exhibit  B,  would  replace  the  bill  as  a  whole.  In \nproposing this amendment, we are trying to create a level of parity. There was \nan  oversight  with  the  emergency  regulation  which  created  a  disparity  in \nattempting to exempt small commercial and residential water heaters.  \n \nWe are attempting to fix the oversight and go forward in legislation instead of a \nregulatory change. As the Legislative Session was right around the corner, we \nestimated it would take a year to a year and a half to promulgate a regulation to \ncorrect  this.  More  importantly,  we  thought  it  was  important  to  put  this  in \nstatute now that tankless water heaters are becoming more desirable and a \nbigger part of the industry. Tankless water heaters are safe, take up a lot less \nspace and easier to provide the redundancy so many people are looking for. We \nthought it best to have these two types of products brought on par in statute so \nif a regulation is promulgated, we do not make the same mistake. \n \nAfter the boiler explosion that occurred at the University of Nevada, Reno, the \nDIR appropriately promulgated regulations to increase safety requirements and \nstandards on the large boilers. In doing so, they recognized the need to exempt \nsmall water heaters and did so in the regulation. The regulation did not extend \nthe exemption to tanked water heaters.  \n \nThe  proposed  amendment,  Exhibit  B,  section  1,  subsection  1  defines  water \nheater as an individual controlled unit. The language was taken at the request of \nthe DIR. The three-pronged approach to be eligible for the exemption is listed in \nsubsection 1, paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), and mirrors the regulation. \n \nThe  DIR  would  like  to  regulate  the  in  series  installation  of  water  heaters. \nIn series water heaters are popular because they save energy and are far more \nefficient. Some gyms set up a series of five or six in series water heaters, and \nwhen  the  demand  is  low,  they  may  run  one  of  them.  When  the  demand \nincreases as more people use the facility, they will increase incrementally until \nthey  are  at  full  capacity.  When  you  use  a  tanked  water  heater,  you  are \nfunctioning at maximum capacity all the time. This means the gas is being used \nto heat the water in anticipation of full capacity.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nAn example of where these may be used in parallel or in a series is a restaurant \nthat  has  requirements  in  code  to  have  hot  water  available  at  all  times.  If \nrestaurants water heaters go out they are out of business, so they will set up \ntankless water heaters or tanks in parallel or in a series. In most cases, gas-fired \ntanked water heaters are set up in parallel to provide that redundancy.  \n \nSenate Bill 205 will correct the disparity in that these two types of technologies \nare treated differently and unfairly. If this is not corrected, and these additional \nregulatory  requirements  apply  to  tankless  water  heaters,  it  will  create  a \nsignificant disincentive for people to install these units because of the additional \nregulatory requirement.  \n \nThe DIR staff members indicated they were unsure they had the authority to \npromulgate a regulation on in series installations. We were asked if anything in \nthe bill would foreclose on their ability to adopt a regulation. In reality, the \nlanguage we are proposing would do the opposite and would direct the DIR to \npromulgate a regulation. They told us it may take a year to promulgate that \nregulation. What about safety in the interim? Massachusetts is the only state in \nthe Union that regulates in series installations.  \n \nAll these in series installations are accounted for in local safety regulations. All \nthe products we are talking about are constructed and designed contemplating \nin series installations. It is common and done across the Country. It should go \nthrough a regulatory process involving the industry in its entirety and not done \naccidentally by the adoption of an emergency regulation. \n \nJAMES YORK (Rinnai America Corporation): \nThis should be a rule-making process because there are nuances that need to be \naddressed which could include permitting based on a system or individual units. \nSay more than one unit installed that exceeds one of the three hurdles on a \nbuilding site becomes regulated, does that mean apartment buildings that have \nindividual  water  heaters  serving  individual  units  become  regulated,  since \ncurrently they are not? Ambiguity will need to be worked through during the \nregulatory process; many items not yet considered will come from the industry. \n \nMR. HARDY: \nWe  need  to  bring  tankless  water  heaters  on  par  with  tanked  heaters  for \npurposes of the statutes and regulations as they currently exist. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe bill is in response to the emergency regulation which is appropriate given \nthe devastating event at the University of Nevada, Reno campus given the scale \nof that explosion and the fact we did not have significant injuries or casualties is \nclose to a miracle.  \n \nThe intent of Senate Bill 205 is to make a correction for an exception and a \npiece of that exception left out was tankless water heaters. Is everything over \nand above that a request of the DIR? \n \nMR. HARDY: \nCorrect. The DIR accepted the language and the definition we had but wanted \nto add the word “single” and are “exempt” if you install a single tankless water \nheater. That puts us at a significant disadvantage and does nothing to fix our \nproblem. Inadvertently, the addition limits us significantly if it limits our ability to \ninstall these in series, which is a common and growing practice in the industry. \nIt is allowed by code and manufacturer. There was an attempt to prevent the \nserial installation of tankless water heaters in this legislation. If that were to \noccur, there would not be the same exemptions or prohibition against in series \ninstallations of tanked heaters that there is for tankless. \n \nNo one knows if or how many tanked water heaters are installed in series. The \nmanufacturers provide instructions on how to install them and they are regularly \ninstalled in parallel to provide redundancy.  \n \nCRAIG  MADOLE  (Nevada  Chapter  Associated  General  Contractors,  Nevada \nAssociation of Mechanical Contractors): \nThe emergency regulation adopted to clarify these smaller hot water heaters \ndoes not require inspection by the state boiler inspector and was pursued and \nadopted on our behalf. It has since been adopted as a permanent regulation. \nWhat was important to understand is that we never contemplated tankless hot \nwater heaters when we were working with the DIR, so this was an oversight on \nour part. We support S.B. 205 with the amendment. If additional regulations are \nrequired, we would work with the DIR to adopt appropriate regulations. This \nfrees up the boiler inspectors to inspect boilers instead of the small hot water \nheaters. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nJORDAN KRAAGNBUHL: \nI support S.B. 205 and the proposed amendment, Exhibit B. I am the Executive \nDirector for the Plumbing Heating and Cooling Contractors of Nevada. I have \nbeen  involved  in  code  writing  for  30  years  both  locally  and  nationally.  The \nUniform Plumbing Code, which is adopted across the state of Nevada, clearly \ndefines what a water heater and boiler are. The threshold of not exceeding \n120 gallons,  200,000  BTUs,  etc.,  gives  manufacturers,  designers  and \ncontractors  code  requirements  for  designing,  permitting  and  installation  and \ninspection. Local jurisdictions require permits and inspections for water heaters. \nBoilers are required to be permitted and inspected by the state. Senate Bill 205, \nas amended, would clarify issues regarding water heater and boiler installations, \npermitting and inspections. \n \nVICTORIA CARREON (Administrator, Division of Industrial Relations, Department of \nBusiness and Industry): \nOur agency is neutral on S.B. 205. The mechanical compliance section within \nthe DIR regulates the safety of boilers. Normally we do not think about boilers, \nbut when one has a problem as in the case of the University of Nevada, Reno, it \ncan be an issue. We take seriously the issue of regulating them and ensuring \nthey are safe for the public.  \n \nWe support providing parity between tankless and tanked water heaters. Water \nheaters with the specifications proposed to be exempted present a low-safety \nrisk and do not need to be permitted. This applies to both tanked and tankless \nwater heaters. However, we are concerned the proposed amendment, Exhibit B, \nwhich allows these water heaters to be installed in a series without a permit. In \nNevada,  there  are  numerous  installations  where  you  can  have  five  tankless \nwater heaters linked together to replace a one million BTU individual boiler. This \ncan be a good thing in that it is more energy efficient and less expensive. They \nshould  be  permitted  because  there  are  things  we  need  to  look  at  such  as \nemergency gas shutdown switches, emergency exits, fire rating of the room \nand room ventilation. When you have that much gas in a room, we feel it needs \nto be reviewed. We do regulate these installations that are in a series.  \n \nThe bill allows regulations to be created for water heaters installed in a series; \nhowever, there would be a gap in time when these installations would not be \nregulated.  It  is  important  to  note  they  are  currently  regulated.  This  is  our \nconcern. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nYou  stated  there  are  regulations  applying  to  multiple  in-line  tankless  water \nheaters. Do we have regulations that apply to multiple in-line traditional water \nheaters? \n \nMS. CARREON: \nToday there is nothing that states multiple installations are regulated just by \nvirtue of all of the waters being regulated. The various types of installations are \nall regulated. This new statute would exempt certain types and create a new \nexemption for those regulated in a series. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAre you saying the way the proposed amendment, Exhibit B, is drafted it would \nexempt  not  only  tankless  water  heaters  but  also  traditional  water  heaters \ninstalled in a series? \n \nMS. CARREON: \nYes. It would exempt those that are tanked; however, in Nevada we are not \naware of any multiple series tanked water heaters that are installed. It would be \nmore efficient to install a larger boiler. The in-line installation is an issue for the \ntankless water heaters. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWere it to happen the legislation as drafted would exempt it. \n \nMS. CARREON: \nYes. The legislation would exempt tanked water heaters by having tanked and \ntankless  water  heaters  exempted  from  in-line  installation,  but  only  tankless \nwater heaters are installed in a series. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThis will take some research by our legal team. It seems we have a difference of \nopinion from the representatives of the bill saying they are not regulated, only \nregulated in Massachusetts, and the DIR is stating they are currently regulated. \nClarity is needed to understand what is and is not currently regulated and how \nthe proposed amendment, Exhibit B, would affect that. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \nMR. HARDY: \nWe  have  written  testimony  in  support  of  this  legislation  from  Navien,  Inc., \n(Exhibit  D),  D  &  D  Plumbing,  Inc.  (Exhibit  E),  Air-Conditioning,  Heating,  & \nRefrigeration  Institute  (Exhibit  F),  Bradford  White  Corporation  (Exhibit  G), \nGardner Engineering (Exhibit H), RHP Mechanical Systems (Exhibit I) and J & J \nMechanical Incorporated (Exhibit J). \n \nWith regard to the timing of the regulation, the issue is whether the State \ninjects itself into this. These installations, across the board, are allowed and \npermitted  and  are  subject  to  local  building  codes  which  are  very  specific. \nManufacturers construct and design the tankless and tanked water heaters for \ninstallation in a series. \n \nThe question is, does this rise to the level of Nevada requiring an additional \nregulatory  burden  on  those  who  install  these  and  additional  expense  for \ncustomers who want to install them? This is where only Massachusetts has \nmade the decision that it rises to extra regulation beyond what is done in the \nlocal code. It is appropriate for Nevada to create the extra regulation on boilers. \nBut, do we need to take the time to do the inspections on those already covered \nin addition by local code? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs that part of the International Building Codes the jurisdictions are adopting \neach year where they are covered by local building codes? \n \nMR. HARDY: \nYes. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIt  would  be  helpful  to  have  testimony  from  local  government  building \ndepartments to have their perspective on whether they are comfortable their \nbuilding codes are addressing the issue you are addressing. If you could provide \nthat for us, please do. \n \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 205 and open the hearing on S.B. 211. \n \nSENATE  BILL  211:  Establishes  requirements  relating  to  testing  for  sexually \ntransmitted diseases. (BDR 40-563) \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \nSENATOR DALLAS HARRIS (Senatorial District No. 11): \nSenate Bill 211 is fairly simple but huge in its impact. Per [HIV.gov], one of the \nelements of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is prevention services. This aspect \nof the ACA for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention includes HIV \ntesting for everyone ages 15 to 65 and for people of other ages at increased \nrisk without additional cost sharing, such as co-pays and deductibles. In 2006, \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended all people \nages 13 to 64 be tested for HIV at least once in healthcare settings. However, \nthe uptake of that recommendation has not been optimal.  \n \nWhile HIV testing by healthcare providers is supported by the ACA and the \nCDC,  many  clients  and  patients  are  not  routinely  offered  this  test  by  their \nproviders. The goal of this legislation is to normalize HIV testing as part of a \nperson’s regular healthcare screening. The hope is that the public health and \nmedical providers might be able to identify folks living with HIV earlier, get them \nmedical  care  and  ideally  help  clients  and  patients  achieve  viral  suppression \nwhich can in turn reduce the number of new HIV infections in the community. \n \nThis bill also includes other sexually transmitted diseases (STD) for the same \nreason. If we have learned anything from Covid-19, it is you need to know your \nstatus. Knowing your status helps with the spread, especially for these types of \ncommunicable diseases. We endeavor to end the pandemic through initiatives \nlike Ending the HIV Epidemic, which is being promoted to end the HIV pandemic \nin the United States by the year 2030. The key strategies are to diagnose, treat, \nprevent and respond.  \n \nThis legislation is not new to Nevada. There are other states are taking similar \nsteps. \n \nCHERYL RADELOFF (Southern Nevada Health District): \nDuring my testimony, I will be reviewing and referring to the bill presentation \n(Exhibit K) on S.B. 211.  \n \nSlide 2 reviews points to consider with this legislation. Often you will see STDs \nand sexually transmitted infections (STI) interchangeably. My understanding is \nthat STIs are typically seen more in public health settings.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \nI  recently  completed  a  training  for  academic  detailing  where  we  use  the \ntechniques  pharmaceutical  representatives  use.  Public  health  agencies  work \nwith providers to give them support on how to complete sexual histories.  \n \nSlide 3 continues with additional points to consider. \n \nSlide 4 has a diagram relating to continuum of care. There is the notion that \ncontinuum of HIV care is not just for treatment but also for prevention. The goal \nis for 90 percent of people to know their status, 90 percent of people diagnosed \nwith HIV get into care and ideally 90 percent become virally suppressed. There \nis a campaign called “Undetectable=Untransmittable.” If a person has HIV, the \nlevels of HIV can get to a point of being undetectable. It is powerful in that we \nare seeing when people have these low viral loads, they will not transmit the \nvirus which will drop what we know as community viral load.  \n \nIf someone tests negative or nonreactive, we want to link the individual to \nprevention services. There has been some discussion and  additional  bills on \nthings such as pre-exposure prophylaxis which is comparable to the birth control \npill. You can take a pill with the idea that if you are exposed to HIV you will not \ncontract  the  disease.  Postexposure  prophylaxis  is  where  you  can  take \nmedication for a month with the idea that if you have been exposed to HIV and \nbegin taking this within 72 hours, you would not acquire HIV. Counseling and \nother preventative services are also available. Ongoing counseling, research and \ntesting are important. \n \nSlide 5 covers ending the HIV epidemic in the United States. These pillars can \nalso be applied to STIs. \n \nSlide 6 covers HIV in Nevada. Many people living with HIV do not know their \nstatus. \n \nSlide 7 covers what we are looking at in terms of people living with HIV in \n2019.  Acquired  immunodeficiency  syndrome  (AIDS)  is  now  known  as \nStage 3 HIV. The majority of people newly diagnosed with HIV were diagnosed \nin Clark County. We see numbers rising in Washoe and other counties. \n \nThere is some powerful legislation for getting information on genders assigned \nat  birth  to  people  who  have  chosen  to  identify  with  a  different  sexual \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 27 \n \norientation or gender identity. This information is captured when we do disease \ninvestigation. \n \nSlide 8 reviews Nevada’s HIV care continuum. \n \nSlides 9 and 10 review Nevada 2019 HIV Fast Facts on New HIV Diagnoses or \nNew Stage 3 AIDS Diagnoses. It is important to note, in terms of inpatient, \nthese are people diagnosed who were in the hospital. By the time people are in \nthe hospital and given a diagnosis of HIV, or stage 3 AIDS, these people can be \nvery sick. We need to make sure we can test people before this point using \nroutine testing. As soon as someone is diagnosed with HIV, we can ideally get \nthem into care and virally suppressed, keeping them healthy. \n \nSlide  11  covers  how  the  cost  of  STIs  is  from  CDC  direct  medical  cost \nestimates, and that $1.1 billion is associated directly with chlamydia, gonorrhea \nand syphilis. These costs do not take into account the indirect cost of, for \ninstance, infertility, which can be associated with gonorrhea and chlamydia, or \npelvic inflammatory disease, cervical cancer, ectopic pregnancy, and heart and \nblood vessel damage.  \n \nSlide 12 covers the state of STIs in Nevada for 2019. In preparing for this \npresentation, I did some research and was concerned that in 2015 we had \n8 cases of congenital syphilis and in 2016 we rose to 12 cases. We were at \n21 cases in 2017, 34 cases in 2018 and 41 cases in 2019. Those rates are \nexponentially of major concern to us. Unfortunately, with congenital syphilis we \nare not alone. We are also seeing such an increase across the United States. \n \nSlides 13, 14 and 15 are showing us the rankings for primary, secondary and \ncongenital syphilis. The lion’s share of cases for congenital syphilis is in Clark \nand Washoe Counties; this is something to be concerned about. \n \nSlide 16 reviews what this legislation will do. We have seen with Covid-19 that \nfrom  the  beginning  of  the  pandemic  in  March  2020,  the  number  of  places \npeople  can  access  testing  has  increased  exponentially.  I  was  trained  as  a \ndisease investigator, and many of us shifted our roles to address the pandemic. \nTo see the changes that have occurred within a year is incredible. \n \nMany STIs are silent. A study done by the CDC showed about 10 percent of \nmen  and  5  percent  to  30  percent  of  women  with  lab-confirmed  chlamydia \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 28 \n \ndeveloped no signs or symptoms of an STI. This says that 90 percent of men \nand about 70 percent of females did not have any signs or symptoms and might \nnot have been tested because they would not have presented to their providers, \nthe patients may not have known. \n \nThe goal is to stop the spread of HIV, STDs, STIs and other communicable \ndiseases as well as promote and fast-track Ending the HIV Epidemic. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nWe know in the 1970s and 1980s HIV and AIDS blossomed so because it was \nconsidered a disease only some people contracted. If you were not that “type” \nof person, you did not have to worry about contracting those diseases. Why is \nit rising so fast?  \n \nMS. RADELOFF: \nEarly in the HIV pandemic, the assumption was we saw this predominantly \namong certain communities. What has changed is that we are seeing it among \nsome of those same communities, but it is not only sexual transmission. We \ncannot forget about the spread of HIV through blood to blood contact by people \nusing injectable drugs. When we look at categories of people, the only way \npeople know will know their status is to be tested. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nDo you have a handle on the age groups affected? \n \nMS. RADELOFF: \nWe are seeing high rates in both HIV and STIs in people 13 to 24 years of age \nand are addressing efforts toward youth and young adults. The highest rates in \nNevada tend to be up to 24 years of age; ages 13 to 18 are showing the \nhighest rates. We see some high rates in ages 24 to 30 and lesser amounts in \nthe 50 and over age bracket. We continue to see newly infected people or \npeople living with HIV. You many have long-term survivors in these numbers, \npeople who are newly diagnosed and new infections. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER:   \nThe requirement is that the test has to be offered, and if feasible, done in an \nemergency or primary care setting. What are the various tests necessary to run \nthe gambit of what we are testing for, and what is the feedback loop time for \ntests? Is it a blood test that is done? \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 29 \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nIt is my understanding that primary care providers are covered and there are \nmany  people  who  use  urgent  care  facilities  as  primary  care  providers.  The \nphysicians in those facilities would be covered under the bill. I would be willing \nto look at a possible amendment if we feel that is needed. \n \nWhen it comes to asking for the test, you are correct. They just need to ask, \nand it can be done in-house, if offered there. If not, the facility or physician can \nassist  in  facilitating  testing,  which  may  include  going  to  a  facility  such  as \nLabcorp or Quest to have the test done.  \n \nThe  way  I  envision  this  working  is  not  particularly  to  cover  any  sexually \ntransmitted diseases but more the general panel of tests done for STIs. It is not \nmeant to create any additional testing for things we do not already test for. We \nwant  to  ensure  we  are  offering  tests  to  everyone  as  a  regular  course  of \npractice. \n \nMS. RADELOFF: \nBlood tests are typically associated with testing for HIV and syphilis. We have \nrapid tests for HIV so people can get results in as soon as 1 minute or up to \n20 minutes, and this can be done in-house. We are now advocating three-site \nSTD testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia in the site people may have been \nexposed. The information cannot be obtained through a blood test for these; it \nmust be site specific. \n \nI believe urgent care facilities are also covered under this legislation since many \npeople use urgent cares as their primary providers.  \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIs there a standard panel for STDs or one specific for the disease someone will \nbe tested for?  \n \nMS. RADELOFF: \nThe typical tests performed for an STD or STI panel would be HIV, syphilis, \ngonorrhea and chlamydia, which could be a physical inspection. The blood draw \nwould be through the arm or a finger stick. The home test for HIV is done as an \noral mucosa cheek swab, and that can take up to 20 minutes for results. The \ngonorrhea and chlamydia test could be a urine sample or site specific where \npeople might have been exposed. That would be part of the dialogue with the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 30 \n \nprovider while obtaining the sexual history to get an idea of where the individual \nmay have been exposed so the proper test is done.  \n \nIf people were engaged in an activity that could put them at risk and would not \ninvolve say a urine sample that was collected, you would miss the diagnosis. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nThis is meant to be a discussion between the patient and their physician. What \ntests are appropriate to one and when? We are not going to prescribe from the \nState level. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe concern might be that in an emergency room setting, it is not necessarily \nthe patient and the primary physician, so that conversation may be difficult. \n \nAre these tests covered under ACA preventative care coverage so there is no \ncharge to the patient, or are they billed to the patient if they are uninsured or \nunderinsured? \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nIt is my intention these services will be billed in the same way they are currently \nbilled. For some that may be through the ACA and for others billed through their \ninsurance provider with a possible co-pay. This bill would not affect how these \nare billed through your insurance or any other mechanism.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDoes section 1, subsection 4, paragraph (a) eliminate criminal penalties if this \nlaw is not followed? \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nYes. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWhat is your ideal vision for the roll-out plan? This includes physician, physician \nassistant, advanced practice registered nurse and midwife. If the patient in the \nemergency room has no relationship with the physician at that visit or another \nfederally qualified health care center, how do we get the word out to providers \nthis is something they are supposed to do? Are we able to provide, through the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 31 \n \npublic  health  systems,  some  education  or  information?  Are  we  hoping  the \nmedical association is going to help out with this? \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nI have the Health Districts for Washoe County and Southern Nevada working \nwith me on this and imagine they would be one conduit to get the information \nout. Generally, this is good medical practice to be asking for these tests.  \n \nANDRE WADE (Silver State Equality): \nI support S.B. 211. Ending the HIV epidemic is finding out one’s status through \ntesting. This bill would increase people’s knowledge of their status so they \nwould not transmit HIV unknowingly. When we normalize testing in a health \ncare environment throughout the system, it destigmatizes HIV. On a recent visit \nto my doctor, he was hesitant asking about HIV testing. When I asked why he \nwas hesitant, he said he did not want people to be taken off guard by asking. If \nhealthcare providers are required to ask about testing, it would make a world of \ndifference in Nevada where the rates of infection are high. \n \nBRADLEY MAYER (Southern Nevada Health District): \nThe Southern Nevada Health District supports S.B. 211. \n \nJOELLE GUTMAN DODSON (Washoe County Health District): \nThe Washoe County Health District supports S.B. 211. \n \nCARLA MICIANO (Southern Nevada Asian Pacific Islander Queer Society): \nThe Southern Nevada Asian Pacific Islander Queer Society supports S.B. 211 \nbecause it establishes requirements for HIV and STD testing. Current medical \npractices require a patient to initiate the conversation regarding their desire to \nobtain HIV and STD tests rather than the provider. This bill requires the provider \nto  ask  the  patients  if  they  would  like  to  be  tested,  allowing  for  greater \nidentification, removing the barrier to testing, improving treatment outcomes \nand  reducing  stigma  surrounding  the  issue.  We  know  HIV  and  STDs \ndisproportionately  affect  the  Asian  Pacific/Islander,  lesbian,  gay,  bisexual, \ntransgendered and queer communities. This bill would move Nevada in a better \ndirection to end the HIV epidemic. \n \nJOSEPH HECK, D.O. (Nevada Osteopathic Medical Association): \nThe Nevada Osteopathic Medical Association opposes to S.B. 211. While we \nwould encourage all primary care providers to be better disciplined in bringing up \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 32 \n \nthis conversation with their patients, we have significant concerns with the bill \nas drafted which is laid out in a letter provided (Exhibit L).  \n \nWhile most of the presentation given by Ms. Radeloff revolved around testing \nfor HIV, the bill is much more encompassing to include STDs of which there are \nmore than 20 with no requirement for any clinical correlation to the tests that \nare being ordered. Which tests should be ordered if there is only a blanket \nrequirement?  \n \nWhile  the  ACA  does  provide  for  required  services  to  be  covered  as \nrecommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force, it should be \nnoted that this is only true for A and B recommendations. For men, there is no \nrecommendation  for  gonorrhea  or  chlamydia;  therefore,  that  would  be  an \nout-of-pocket expense. For syphilis, there is recommendation A only in certain \ncategories of individuals who have other high-risk criteria.  \n \nThere cannot just be a blanket test for all STD or STIs be covered. In addition, \nhaving these done in an emergency room significantly increases cost since this \nis  the  most  expensive  place  to  receive  care  and  would  have  no  direct \nconnection to the potential presenting complaint of the patient. A 16-year-old \nfrom a high school football game coming in with a sprained ankle is going to get \nan X-ray. Is this the time you want to bring up a conversation about testing for \nSTDs?  \n \nWhile we applaud the efforts to increase diagnosis, prevention and treatment, \nthere are significant logistical concerns with the bill as drafted. \n \nDUANE  YOUNG  (Deputy  Administrator,  Division  of  Health  Care  Financing  and \nPolicy, Department of Health and Human Services): \nThe Division has placed a fiscal note based on increased utilization. We have \nspoken with Senator Harris and are working with the Division of Public and \nBehavioral Health and other partners to mitigate some of those costs. We feel \nthis is good policy and is in line with promotional efforts that the Division made \nin conjunction with the Division of Public and Behavioral Health to promote \nSTD testing through its fee-for-service and managed care programs. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nThis is not a bill that requires mandatory testing. It only requires the question be \nasked. What tests are performed will be a conversation between the doctor and \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 33 \n \nthe patient, as it should be. There is no requirement that someone be tested for \nevery STD, simply that the doctor ask would you like a test for STDs and HIV.  \nWe have seen what the numbers were in Ms. Radeloff’s presentation. By simply \nrequiring doctors to ask for these tests, we can make a dent in those numbers. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 211. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe remainder of page intentionally left blank; signature page to follow.   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 34 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSeeing no public comment, the meeting is adjourned at 6:28 p.m. \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nVickie Polzien, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 35 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nBegins \nExhibit \nBill   on  Witness / Entity  Description \nLetter \nPage \n  A  1    Agenda \nWarren Hardy / Rinnai \nS.B. 205  B  1  Proposed Amendment \nAmerica Corporation \nWarren Hardy / Rinnai \nS.B. 205  C  1  Support Memo \nAmerica Corporation \nKevin Pirotin / Navien, \nS.B. 205  D  1  Support Statement \nInc. \nWaylon Lowery / \nS.B. 205  E  1  Support Statement \nD and D Plumbing, Inc. \nAlison Maginot / Air-\nConditioning Heating \nS.B. 205  F  1  Support Statement \nand Refrigeration \nInstitute \nEric Truskoski / \nS.B. 205  G  1  Bradford White  Support Statement \nCorporation \nRobert Gardner / \nS.B. 205  H  1  Support Statement \nGardner Engineering \nMike Scolari and \nS.B. 205  I  1  Robert Sandoval / RHP  Support Statement \nMechanical Systems \nMargaret Cavin / J and \nS.B. 205  J  1  J Mechanical  Support Statement \nIncorporated \nCheryl Radeloff / \nWashoe County and \nS.B. 211  K  1  Bill Presentation \nSouthern Nevada \nHealth Districts \nNevada Osteopathic \nS.B. 211  L  1  Opposition Statement \nMedical Association \n ", "53": "\nSENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n \nEighty-first Session \nMarch 25, 2021 \n \n \nThe Senate Committee on Health and Human Services was called to order by \nChair Julia Ratti at 3:34 p.m. on Thursday, March 25, 2021, Online.

This just provides more flexibility to figure out \nwhat would be on them and what is best served on a label included with the \nproducts. The regulations we have now would not go away if this was passed. \nIt takes exactly what should be on there out of the statute and moves it to the \nBoard to continually be flexible as it promulgates regulations. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nAre you continuing to do the exact kind of labeling until the Board's regulatory \nprocess is in place, which is not a slow process? \n \nMR.

(BDR 38-705) \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nSENATOR JULIA RATTI (Senatorial District No. 13): \nSenate Bill 274 is one of my top priorities for this Legislative Session. It follows \nS.B. No. 293 of the 80th Session. This bills seeks to make sure when a child is \na victim of sexual exploitation for money and has been trafficked, the child will \nbe treated as a victim and then survivor in the child welfare system as opposed \nto being treated as a perpetrator in the juvenile justice system. When we looked \nat this same concept last Session, I was convinced if we said it is mandatory, \nno child can go into the juvenile justice system who has been trafficked in \nthis way. \n \nThere was not sufficient time to transition our systems from juvenile justice and \nchild welfare, and we would risk putting some children in danger. We passed \nS.B. No. 293 of the 80th Session to give the juvenile justice systems, legal aid, \npublic  defenders,  child  welfare  systems  and  nonprofits  time  to  have \nconversations about how we get there. We wanted to do it in a way that puts \nthe best interest of the child first with a trauma-informed approach to make sure \nthe child has the support he or she needs.  \n \nWe also gave the State money to hire a consultant to facilitate that process. \nThis allowed great conversations between the different agencies and institutions \nthat would interface with the child who has, unfortunately, been the victim of \nsuch a horrific crime. We also started to talk about what would be necessary for \nus to transform the systems, and that has resulted in S.B. 274. This bill starts \nto  build  out  some  of  the  structures  necessary  to  get  us  there.  I  have \ntwo subject matter experts here, Bailey Bortolin from the legal aid community, \nwho brought forward this bill concept and has been actively involved in the \nworking group since last Session, and I have Kathryn Roose from the Division of \nChild and Family Services (DCFS), who has helped to lead some of this work. \n \nKATHRYN ROOSE (Deputy Administrator, Division of Child and Family Services, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nI  am  honored  to  present  S.B.  274  which  revises  provisions  relating  to \ncommercially  sexually  exploited  children  (CSEC).  The  bill  has  three  major \ncomponents. First are regulations that allow for the establishment of receiving \ncenters. Second is a legal framework for involuntary commitment for the child \nto a receiving center. Last are provisions for DCFS to certify other programs for \nserving this population. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nThe conceptual amendment (Exhibit E) has been developed with stakeholders. \nKey changes include section 7 to locate the receiving center licensing authority \nin  Nevada  Revised  Statutes  (NRS) 424  while  maximizing  potential  federal \nrevenue to support receiving centers. Sections 19 through 27 make changes to \nthe emergency admission process while streamlining the process to create court \nefficiencies and remove requirements that may lead to barriers to services. The \n\"detain\"  language  will  be  replaced  with  \"placement,  assessment,  and \ntreatment\"  to  ensure  the  ability  to  maximize  potential  Medicaid  revenue. \nAdjustments to NRS 432C language reflect assessment instead of screening. \n \nI will walk you through the major concepts of the bill. Sections 10 through 13 \ndiscuss receiving centers as licensed secured facilities that operate 24 hours a \nday, 7 days a week to provide specialized inpatient and outpatient services to \nCSEC.  It  also  requires  DCFS  to  develop  licensing  requirements  and \ncorresponding regulations, and describes the services that shall be available to \nyouth in the receiving center. \n \nSection  14  describes  the  process  for  admission  into  the  receiving  center, \nincluding  emergency  admission,  court-ordered  admission  and  voluntary \nadmission. The second category of the bill provides the legal framework for \ninvoluntary placement. This changes the most substantially with the conceptual \namendment. \n \nSections 15 through 27 describe procedures governing emergency admissions \nand court-ordered admissions. This includes requirements to attempt to contact \nparents,  provides  for  retention  of  counsel  to  represent  the  child,  requires  a \nhearing following an emergency or court-order admission and requires a hearing \non court-ordered admissions every five days while the child is in the receiving \ncenter.  \n \nIt  is  important  to  note  that  the  regulations  around  the  receiving  center  are \npermissive. They do not require identified CSEC to be placed into a receiving \ncenter, they just lay out the framework for the model. \n \nSection 16 authorizes DCFS to require certification of other types of facilities or \norganizations other than receiving centers that provide services to CSEC. It also \nallows  DCFS  to  adopt  regulations  regarding  certification,  if  necessary,  and \napplication for the issuance or renewal of certificates and related activities. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nFinally, S.B. No. 293 of the 80th Session prohibits adjudication of a child who is \nalleged  to  have  violated  certain  laws  relating  to  prostitution  if  there  is \nreasonable cause to believe that the child is commercially sexually exploited. \nEffective July 1, 2022, the language in S.B. 274 in section 35, postpones that \ndate until July 1, 2023. Those are the main components of the bill. \n \nBAILEY BORTOLIN (Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers): \nThe final report (Exhibit F) from the working group at DCFS, Senate Bill 293 \nReport, was robust work. We looked at what other states are doing; however, \nthere are not a lot of models. This is an emerging area for states to develop \nservices; there is widespread agreement that this is the correct policy. This is \nthe shift we need to make for these children. We are all putting our heads \ntogether to figure out how we fiscally make this happen. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nI  want  to  provide  more  context  in  challenges  faced  with  this  particular \npopulation.  A  child  is  recovered  because  of  frequent  interactions  with  law \nenforcement and found to be a victim of a crime of sexual exploitation. Some of \nthose children have a stable home with parents who are ready and able to assist \nthem. We need to wrap that family with support and make sure children are \nsafe while we reconnect them to their parents, so those parents take over their \ncare and assume the lead role, determining if they need counseling. There is a \nshort period of time when that child may be under the influence of a pimp or \nothers who may encourage that child to run. \n \nThere is the critical time period when that child would end up in a juvenile \nfacility in most cases today. Rather than that happening, this receiving center \nconcept is a child welfare-centered space that would have a locked door, but \nthe child would be living in the child welfare system with the supports and \nservices that come along with that system. In other cases, there may be a \nquestion about the  ability for the  parents to assist a child.  There might be \nneglect, sometimes abuse, and that child would then transition into the child \nwelfare system anyway because this triggers a new set of processes and rules \nwithin the system with any child where there is a question of neglect or abuse. \nIn that case, the receiving center is a space to take care of that child while \ntransitioning  into,  perhaps,  the  foster  care  system,  treatment  placement  or \nwhatever is the next step. Not every child who is sexually exploited will have \nthe  same  path.  It  will  depend  upon  other  life  characteristics  to  determine \nwhether he or she continues in the child welfare system. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nIn all cases, this bill seeks to keep children out of the juvenile justice system \nbecause of a strong philosophical underpinning that they are victims and not \nperpetrators. They should not be treated as criminals, rather as victims so they \ncan become survivors and get the support they need. \n \nIt is disturbing that not a lot of good work is being done across the Country on \nthis issue. If any state gets this right, it is Nevada because of the many facets \nof  a  tourism-driven  economy,  special  events  we  draw  people  to  and  the \nunfortunate number of children trafficked into and throughout our State. If we \ncan lead the Nation in this space and show others how to do it, that is where \nwe need to go. It is not possible to build the whole thing in a short period of \ntime, but it is critically important for the children, and we are making steps in \nthe right direction. I have been pleased with the commitment of the nonprofits, \nand State and county agencies to do something quite challenging and to do \nright by these children. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nI am trying, in my practice, to be more intentional about language. Is there a \nreason why we chose the phrase \"receiving center\"? Is there the ability for \nlanguage that is more people-centered aside from a receiving center? \n \nMS. ROOSE: \nThe  term  \"receiving  center\"  was  discovered  by  the  S.B.  No.  293  of  the \n80th Session work group that spent the Interim Session working on reaching \nout  to  every  state  in  the  Nation  to  see  what  states  are  doing  with  this \npopulation and how we are best serving these children. The states of Georgia \nand Washington both have models for receiving centers. Georgia's center has \nbeen in place over a year, and Washington passed a bill to open two receiving \ncenters in July. The term has already been used in the Country. I have no \nparticular attachment to the term. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nI had the same thought you did about the term. Do any facilities now meet the \nqualification of a receiving center? \n \nMS. ROOSE: \nNo. County facilities could be more easily transformed into receiving centers, \nbut nothing exists as outlined in the bill to include being a secured facility with \nthe type of staffing required for a receiving center. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThat is the reason for the extension of the bill deadline. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIs it a vision that the receiving center will be a subset of a larger facility? \nSection 12, subsection 2, paragraph (d), looks like a subset of a larger structure \nor  organization.  Section  16,  says  DCFS  may  adopt  regulations  requiring \ncertification  of  a  facility  or  organization,  other  than  a  receiving  center,  if  it \nprovides these type of services. Would there be a new set of regulations for a \ncounseling group that provides mental health services, potentially? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nIt could be a specialized foster home. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe term organization rather than facility made me think it could be an LLC, a \ngroup of mental health counselors. I appreciate the bill. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nYou stated it could be a specialized foster home. It has to be secure and secure \nfrom escape and other people coming into the home? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nYes, if that was one of the models. If it serves the receiving center function, \nthere could be a portion or entire facility that did have the ability to be locked \nand keep people from either leaving or coming. We want to create the structure \nand  work  on  the  language  so  these  facilities  can  qualify  for  Medicaid  and \nfunding. The counties and nonprofit groups need to put their heads together, \nonce they see funding streams, about facilities and services that can be built. \nHowever, a locked facility with an ability to place and treat is part of the model. \n \nMS. BORTOLIN: \nThe receiving center model would be for the initial contact in some cases where \nappropriate.  We  still  want  to  comply  by  the  least  restrictive  environment \nnecessary.  A  comprehensive  model  to  provide  services  specific  to  this \npopulation would need to have multiple levels. Specialized foster care, in and of \nitself, would not be the locked part, but some youths in foster care may be \nrequire that setting. In that case we do not want to escalate. By the same \ntoken, someone in the initial contact who comes in through the receiving center \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nmay de-escalate as they receive services. It is about building a model that works \ncomprehensively throughout the system of care as the child's needs change. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nI  mixed  those  two  things  up.  The  receiving  center  is  separate  from  the \nspecialized foster care. I am retracting my former answer, so please follow what \nMs. Bortolin just stated. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe  goal  then  is  to  get  this  paid  for  and  Medicaid  eligible.  We  want  the \nreceiving center to have the ability to get federal money, is that correct? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nYes. The goal of the bill is to tie this component, the receiving center, to federal \nTitle IV-E foster care dollars. We are also trying to set up a system of care, but \nnot all of it is represented in this bill. The language of this bill is important so \nthat as the child moves out of the receiving center into other forms of care, \nthen Medicaid and Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) dollars can kick in. Title IV-E \nfederal funds are important if we are to shift from juvenile justice into child \nwelfare. \n \nMS. BORTOLIN: \nThe receiving center language is permissive; the goal is to get there. There is \nagreement with the policy, and counties want to get there. The language must \nbe flexible to allow them to build it in a way that works for them. There may be \npossible VOCA dollars and ways to integrate Medicaid dollars. Decision-making \nis with the county that ends up owning this receiving center process. \n \nJOHN  PIRO  (Chief  Deputy  Public  Defender,  Clark  County  Public  Defender's \nOffice): \nWe support S.B. 274. This is a solution-focused bill. We were in support of the \nbill from last Session where its aim was to help victims and provide services. It \nis our goal, both at Clark County and the Washoe County Public Defender's \nOffice, to stop a cycle of victimization. The intent of this bill does just that. We \nsupport this intent because it moves away from arresting child victims who \nhave been victims of horrendous crimes and detaining them as if they are the \ncriminals,  which  the  juvenile  justice  system  does  to  these  young  men  and \nwomen.  We  favor  and  support  moving  away  from  that  model  and  into  a \nsupportive  model.  We  will  continue  to  discuss  due  process  issues  with  the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nsponsor. We fully support moving away from criminalizing these young children \nwho  are  not  criminals  and  should  no  longer  be  treated  as  criminals  by  the \njuvenile justice system. \n \nSERENA EVANS (Nevada Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual Violence): \nWe support S.B. 274. Trafficked youth should not be treated like perpetrators. \nThey  need  to  be  treated  like  victim  survivors  rather  than  be  punished  and \ndetained  in  juvenile  justice  centers.  These  individuals  require  empathy  and \nresources, and we are in favor of adopting this new bill to provide the necessary \nsupport for these youth in this State. \n \nTESS OPFERMAN (Nevada Women's Lobby): \nWe support S.B. 274. Sexually exploited children must be viewed as victim \nsurvivors and be treated as such. The establishment of a receiving center is \ncritical to ensure these children are given appropriate treatment and protection \nto  get  them  away  from  the  human  trafficker  and  out  of  being  the  sexual \nexploitation victim. Some of the children in these situations may be addicted to \ndrugs, may have committed illegal offenses and may be under the power and \ncontrol  of  a  pimp.  These  children  may  or  may  not  have  stable  living \nenvironments outside of their situations. A receiving center will address the \nmany complicated situations presented to ensure excluded children are not sent \ninto the juvenile justice system but given the treatment and protection they \nneed.  This  bill  is  one  solution  to  a  multifaceted  issue,  and  we  urge  the \nCommittee's support. \n \nDASHUN JACKSON (Director, Children's Advocacy Alliance): \nWe  support  S.B.  274.  It  is  extremely  important  for  youth  who  have  been \nvictimized and exploited. This bill establishes youth are victims, not criminals, \nand we need to treat the abuse as such. \n \nJIM HOFFMAN (Nevada Attorneys for Criminal Justice): \nWe support S.B. 274. The bill introduced last Session was an important step \nforward, and this bill provides a strong framework for effectuating the goal, \nhelping kids who get caught up in bad situations. We have similar concerns to \nthose expressed by Mr. Piro. In particular, we are concerned about the provision \nthat would delay the implementation of S.B. No. 293  of the 80th Session, \nleaving victims to face continued criminal prosecution for another year. We are \nalso concerned about the bill's provision for charging parents for the use of the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nreceiving center, which also conflicts with a bill passed last Session to take fees \nout of the juvenile system. We are hopeful these issues can be addressed. \n \nBRIGID  DUFFY  (Director,  Juvenile  Division,  Clark  County  District \nAttorney's Office): \nWe support S.B. 274. We have been working with stakeholders to make sure \nwe have a strong bill to ensure children—who are actually victims of child sex \ntrafficking—are not treated as criminals. \n \nAMBER HOWELL (Director, Human Services Agency, Washoe County): \nWe are testifying in neutral on S.B. 274. Until today, we were not aware of the \namendment that changes language to allow us to maximize our Title IV-E funds. \nWe  believe  in  the  policy  and  change  in  the  model,  but  we  want  to  do  it \nsuccessfully and maximize federal funding to decrease as much of the general \nfund portion of the county as possible. We look forward to coming back in \nsupport once we work on the language. \n \nJOANNA JACOB (Clark County): \nWe are testifying in neutral on S.B. 274. We are working with the bill sponsors, \nthe State, child welfare agencies, nonprofits and many stakeholders on how to \nmeet the intent of the bill. We keep moving forward to develop a system of care \nfor our CSEC youth, understanding the importance of this issue. This bill in its \noriginal form would have had a significant fiscal impact to the county. We are \nworking to address those impacts with the amendments presented today. We \nhope  to  revise  the  fiscal  note  as  the  bill  works  through  the  process.  It  is \nimperative for Clark and Washoe Counties to maximize as much federal funding \nas we can to continue these services. As the safety net for our community, we \nmust  build  a  system  of  care  to  support  this  fundamental  shift  away  from \njuvenile justice to the child welfare setting. The child welfare setting is a totally \ndifferent  concept.  We  operate  in  the  best  interest  of  the  child  that  is \nfundamentally different from the juvenile justice setting, which is why it is such \na shift. \n \nThe system of care we want to build is one that may take us some time, \nconsidering  we  have  limited  resources  as  does  the  State.  That  is  why  we \nappreciate working toward this and the extension of time to build the correct \nsystem. We want it to be successful. We estimate that in southern Nevada, \n100 to 150 CSEC youth are identified by law enforcement and child welfare \nevery year. About half of those youth are coming through our child welfare \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nsetting. This number is quite likely higher. We are working on this and have \nreferrals and whole teams at Clark County that partner with juvenile justice and \nthe Las Vegas Metro Police Department to assess and provide services once we \nare contacted through a hotline under NRS 432C. \n \nWe appreciate the language in the conceptual amendment. We understand this \npopulation may need intensive services at times. In other states, the housing \nsupport for this population can cost up to $400 to $600 per day because of the \nintensive need for staffing and counseling. Clark County is entering the next \nbudget  year  with  an  estimated  structural  deficit  of  $29  million  in  our  child \nwelfare setting. We are facing further cuts in the State budget, and we must \ncontinue to deliver these critical services to our community. The new amended \nversion of the bill may not be without its costs, but we are committed to getting \nthis done.  \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nI want to express my gratitude to the professionals I am working with on this \nbill,  including  the  juvenile  justice  system,  child  welfare  and  nonprofits  who \nservice these youths who have had such a devastating experience. I do not \nwant to leave the impression that the individuals and professionals who work in \nthe juvenile justice system do not care as much about kids as those who work \nin the child welfare system. This bill is about the children being treated as \nvictims who can become survivors as opposed to being treated as criminals. I \nwant to be clear, this bill draws a line in the sand to say we are not going to \ncontinue to do this any longer. That line was July 1, 2022; the amendment \nproposes July 1, 2023, to give people more time to build a system. It enables \nreceiving  centers,  but  if  a  receiving  center  does  not  get  built,  that  line \nstill exists. \n \nWe want the child welfare system to step up and get the juvenile justice system \nto step back when it comes to the issues. After a few years of trying, we \ncannot quite figure out a way. Being 100 percent transparent, the bill reads that \nby this day, it will happen. A much better system can be built. I recognize \nNevada has a long way to go in children's mental health, and that will be true \nafter this bill passes. We probably will not have the systems of care we want to \nserve all youth, let alone these youth. I am no longer willing to say that because \nwe do not have that system it is okay for that child to be walking around with \nan ankle bracelet. That is the context of this bill. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 274. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will open the hearing on S.B. 96. \n \nSENATE  BILL  96:  Makes  various  changes  relating  to  services  provided  to \npersons with autism spectrum disorders. (BDR S-89) \n \nSENATOR JAMES OHRENSCHALL (Senatorial District No. 21): \nI am passionate about helping the autism community and will be presenting \nS.B. 96. With me today is Bailey Bortolin with the Coalition of Legal Service \nProviders  and  Julie  Ostrovsky  with  the  Nevada  Commission  on  Autism \nSpectrum Disorders. I will give some opening remarks and then Ms. Bortolin and \nCommissioner  Ostrovsky  will  present  the  bill.  Also  with  me  today  is \nAssemblywoman  Teresa  Benitez-Thompson,  Majority  Floor  Leader,  who  will \npresent an update on the Performance Audit, Delivery of Treatment Services for \nChildren with Autism 2020 (Exhibit G) and a friendly amendment (Exhibit H) to \nS.B. 96. \n \nIn 2019, I was here with many of the same people, presenting S.B. No. 174 of \nthe 80th Session, requesting this very same rate increase and an audit. This \nCommittee  supported  the  rate  increase  and  the  audit.  Unfortunately,  the \nmuch-needed Medicaid increase did not survive the 2019 Session due to a lack \nof  resources,  but  the  audit  did.  As  you  will  hear  from  Assemblywoman \nBenitez-Thompson, the Performance Audit, Exhibit G, strongly stated the need \nfor a Medicaid rate increase for registered behavior technicians (RBTs) providing \nautism applied behavioral analysis (ABA) interventions. In addition, the Audit \nexposed other challenges in the administration of some programs and found a \nfew discrepancies in reimbursements for ABA services. \n \nAs a result of this Audit, we have numbers to support this rate increase. We see \ntoo  many  children  being  left  behind  and  left  out  of  medically  necessary \ninterventions  due  to  a  shortage  of  providers  because  of  our  low  Medicaid \nreimbursement rates. Now we have the opportunity to do the right thing for this \nvulnerable population. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN TERESA BENITEZ-THOMPSON (Assembly District No. 27): \nI had the pleasure of serving as Vice Chair of the Audit Committee and am here \nin that capacity. Legislative Audit 22-04 was heard late in the year, past the \npoint where many bill draft requests had already been allocated. During the \nhearing, I told Senator Ohrenschall we are hearing the Audit your bill requested \nand finding good information. We are going to need a vehicle to continue this \nconversation on this bill. We need to talk about rates and get our rates figured \nout at the same time we are getting processes and systems worked out. He \nwas amenable to that, and I appreciate his bill which addresses concerns and \nissues within the Audit that make the most sense to continue with in statute. \n \nI will reference specific pieces from the conceptual amendment, Exhibit H, we \nare seeking to fix. The Division of Health Care Financing and Policy (DHCFP) \nshall biannually establish comparable market rates for the RBT, board certified \nassistant behavior analyst (BCaBA) and board certified behavior analyst (BCBA) \nlicensing types. \n \nThere are three types of licensing professionals who can do this work, and it \ndepends on their number of hours and training. The RBT requires a high school \ndiploma,  criminal  background  check,  40  hours  of  training  and  passing \ncompetency  assessments.  There  are  approximately  1,290  RBTs  licensed  in \nNevada.  The  other  rates  we  mentioned  are  the  BCaBA,  which  requires  a \nbachelor's degree with 180 hours in content area, principles, research methods, \nan additional 500 hours in intensive university practicum and 1,000 hours of \nsupervised independent field work. As of October 2020, there were 34 licensed \nin  the  State.  Lastly,  the  BCBA  requires  a  master's  degree,  750  hours  of \nintensive university practicum and 1,500 hours of supervised independent field \nwork. As of November 2020, there were 290 licensed in the State. \n \nPages 3 and 35 of the Audit found that Medicaid Services of the DHCFP is \npaying competitive rates compared to the market rate for two of those rates. \nThe one specific rate for the RBT was very much under the market rate. Private \ninsurers are averaging $62 per hour, and the Medicaid rate was $31 per hour, a \n$31 difference. The arguments we have been hearing and concerns from the \ncommunity are that because the RBT rate is so low and not competitive, we \ncannot get any of our children on Medicaid to receive these services. The Audit \nfound that was true. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nThe DHCFP shall establish reasonable limits to the number of service hours a \nprovider can bill in a 24-hour period and provide training on those rules. The \nAudit, pages 13 through 16, identifies issues concerning billing from private \nproviders. The number of hours being charged in a day or per child was not \nadding up. We need DHHS to define how many hours on the backend of its \nbilling system can be charged before a flag lets it know there is an issue. The \nDHHS either needs to communicate with the provider, or look at billing the \nprovider submits to ensure we do not have erroneous billing that continues to \npile up and create a backlog; DHCFP is making progress on that. \n \nThe Autism Treatment Assistance Program (ATAP) shall publish on its website \nspecific guidance on how to obtain a diagnosis and treatment, and maintain a \nlist of healthcare professionals qualified in performing the diagnosis of an autism \nspectrum disorder. The Audit was specific to the fact they struggled to find this \ninformation. Families need more resources to know what to do once they have a \ndiagnosis or how to get a qualified professional once they have a diagnosis.  \n \nThe Legislative Committee on Health Care shall receive from the DHCFP reports \non a number of different data. This is on page 17 of the Audit and page 61 of \nthe recommendations coming from the Audit. So much of the population getting \nservices are being handled through managed care organizations outside of the \nfee for service or where Medicaid can track them. On the backend system, the \nAudit found that the right data collection was not in place to understand what \nwas happening with this particular part of the population. We want DHCFP to \nreport on these items to the Legislative Committee on Health Care for greater \nunderstanding and transparency. We are a few months away from when DHCFP \ncan testify for this recommendation to be fully implemented from the Audit. \nOnce it is, the timing will be perfect as the Legislative Committee on Health \nCare begins in August.  \n \nWhen there is a waitlist for services, ATAP shall use risk assessment tools to \nassess and identify children with higher needs to ensure proper service delivery \nand triage to children who are the hardest to serve. Pages 25 and 26 of the \nAudit talk about the waitlist for children who are waiting for services. The wait \ntime is about 153 days before they get services; this is too long. We do not \nwant a waitlist, but in the meantime, we need a way for DHHS to assess \nchildren who need services immediately and get them into services quickly. The \nrisk assessment tools are being developed by ATAP, and we are hopeful they \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nwill  identify  those  children  who  simply  cannot  wait  and  promptly  get \nthem services. \n \nLastly, the ATAP program may add or unfreeze developmental specialists to \nallow them to fully implement Recommendation 10 from the Audit to supply \ncase managers. Page 66 of the Audit is the reference to this recommendation. \nThe families need staff who are designated to help guide them through the \nsystem when children get diagnosed. Unless we have that piece in place, we \nare not properly helping connect children with resources. We need that case \nmanagement piece for this to be an effective program. The positions are not \nbuilt  into  this  year's  budgets.  We  know  DHCFP  was  planning  for  them  in \nfour years.  This  Audit  puts  so  much  evidence  together,  we  cannot  wait \nfour years. If we can bring the staff on in this biennium, it makes sense to give \nthe time and effort to do this, and that is our goal. \n \nJULIE  OSTROVSKY  (Commissioner,  Nevada  Commission  on  Autism  Spectrum \nDisorders): \nWe support S.B. 96. It is the Commission's responsibility to monitor ATAP, \nMedicaid programs, early intervention services, as well as insurance, Medicaid \nrates and services for people with autism. I submitted a longer, more detailed \nwritten testimony (Exhibit I), but today I want to share a few key notes. We \nsupport this bill because of the large number of children on Medicaid who do \nnot  get  the  intervention  they  need  and  deserve.  We  also  recognize  the \nimportance of paying providers who serve the autism population. Businesses \ndeserve to make a sustainable wage to do business in Nevada. We have a \nproblem in our State. Children on Medicaid are unable to obtain ABA behavioral \nintervention services. \n \nIn Nevada, we have waitlists for children to be diagnosed and obtain services, \nand  painfully  low  Medicaid  rates  that  further  limit  access  to  life-changing \nservices. The Audit from January states that a shortage of ABA providers for \nchildren  with  Medicaid  coverage  is  worse  than  for  children  with  private \ninsurance since only about one-third of licensed ABA providers served Medicaid \nchildren in fiscal year 2020. If we ask providers today, the number would be \neven less. The Autism Legal Resource Center submitted charts (Exhibit J) that \nshow Nevada's low Medicaid reimbursement rate nationally and in the Western \nRegion. We are the lowest in the region. Delays in delivering services to children \nwith autism can have devastating consequences. The lack of Medicaid providers \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nworking with children in our State is unacceptable. A child can languish over a \nyear for a diagnosis and then is forced to wait for services equally as long. \n \nAmong the findings of the Audit is the $30.28 hourly rate paid by Medicaid is \nthe  same  rate  paid  by  ATAP  and  half  the  rate  private  insurers  pay.  Now \nMedicaid has been reduced by 6 percent retroactively as a result of A.B. No. 3 \nof  the  31st  Special  Session.  This  solidifies  our  standing  at  the  bottom  of \nMedicaid  reimbursements  across  the  Country.  This  rate  pays  for  services \nperformed by professional RBTs who are licensed, fingerprinted, trained, insured \nand more. This rate is well below the average $62 paid by insurance. The Audit \nconcludes that the rate disparity is a major barrier to these children receiving \nservices from our limited providers. Senate Bill 96 can help us solve the problem \nof access to services by increasing our Medicaid reimbursement rate to at least \n$48 per hour. \n \nWe have a chance this Session to do the right thing. We can fix this problem by \nincreasing our reimbursement rate to a competitive rate, thereby bringing in \nlocal providers and businesses from across the Country to provide services to \nour autism Medicaid population. This is not the first time we have asked for an \nincrease. We were here in 2015, 2017 and 2019. We did not get the rate \nincrease  but  this  informative,  helpful  Audit.  We  are  here  again  with  new \nsupporting documentation asking for the same increase. Parents are desperate \nand at a loss because no providers are available to help their children. We must \nimprove our access to services for children on Medicaid. Nevada is competing \nwith our neighboring states for talented, passionate, honest providers. \n \nAs of 11:00 a.m. this morning, there were 442 opinions in favor of S.B. 96. \nThe Legislative Audit makes it clear that it is good policy to increase the RBT \nrate and to address the barriers faced by children needing ABA services on \nMedicaid. We ask you to support and pass S.B. 96 out of this Committee so \ncosts can be further evaluated by the Senate Finance Committee. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIn  the  audit  process,  would  any  efficiencies  or  ways  from  some  of  the \nrecommendations free up resources that would put the State in a better position \nto invest in the rate structure? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN BENITEZ-THOMPSON: \nIn the Audit, we looked at the State expenditures and anticipated expenditures. \nPages 8 through 11 discuss expenditures related to this particular program. In \nthe  past  when  we  thought  about  the  costs  for  the  program,  DHCFP \noverestimated the number of children it anticipated would be served. There was \na big gap between projections and actual cases. The money being appropriated \ndid not always get used as quickly as it could have. Additional money being \nappropriated  did  not  end  up  where  we  hoped  it  would.  I  encourage  the \nCommittee to look at the numbers and charts with data from the past five years \non page 9 of the Audit. Good information in the Audit will help guide us to that \nbetter rate we can afford. \n \nSENATOR OHRENSCHALL: \nPage 20 of the Audit discusses S.B. No. 174 from the 80th Session and the \nfiscal note. Near the top of the page, I am quoting \"ATAP's waitlist caseload \nprojections  for  the  fiscal  note  appear  unreasonable  in  comparison  to  actual \n2020 numbers.\" There is some tightening up of those projections, which if more \naccurate  could  lead  to  more  children  getting  the  services  they  need. \nUnfortunately, they were not, according to this Audit. \n \nMS. BORTOLIN: \nIn past years, we put money into autism services that has gone in the wrong \nplace. It needs to be in this rate, which is what the Audit found. In the last \nbiennium, then-Governor Brian Sandoval put $42 million into autism services he \nbelieved would clear the waitlist, but because the rate was not changed, we did \nnot have enough providers for services. Tens of millions of those dollars went \nunspent and reverted back to the General Fund. This Audit proves the rate is the \nactual place that needs to be fixed. \n \nAs far as cost savings outside of this specific service, we are spending a lot of \nmoney as a State and community on this population because their needs are \ngoing unmet. It is important these children receive services at a young age \nimmediately, as soon as we can access them, and get a diagnosis to change \noutcomes. The later in life we connect them to those services, the harder it is to \nbe successful in that treatment. \n \nClark County's Eighth Judicial District has a Detention Alternative for Autistic \nYouth Court, a juvenile delinquency court with enough children to fill a specialty \ndocket. These children have autism that has manifested its behavioral issues \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nbecause they are unable to access services. It is great we have a legal system \nto rally around these children to get them the services they need; however, \ndoing it through the Judicial Branch is not appropriate or financially responsible. \nShifting the cost in this way will save us money across the board. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe never want to have a child on a waitlist in any situation. When that does \nhappen, the recommendation is to triage and identify which children should be \nat the top of the list. Are there tools? Are other states doing this? Do we have a \ngood  way  for  assessing  that?  Are  we  making  difficult  decisions,  ensuring \nchildren getting the services are those who need it most? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN BENITEZ-THOMPSON: \nThe Aging and Disability Services Division (ADSD) can speak to this more. Its \nwritten recommendation response in the Audit indicates the ADSD is working \non that tool and expects it to be used going forward. \n \nRIQUE  ROBB  (Deputy  Administrator,  Aging  and  Disability  Services  Division, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nI will turn this over to the Program Manager, Samantha Jayme, and she will \nexplain what we have done to meet that specific requirement of the Audit in \nregard to the assessment. \n \nSAMANTHA  JAYME  (Health  Program  Manager,  Aging  and  Disability  Services \nDivision, Department of Health and Human Services): \nWe have piloted this tool and expect the quality assurance team to do our \nchecks and balances, and ensure it makes sense. We are getting the children \ntriaged appropriately. We are submitting our follow-up to the Audit, and we \nhope to fully implement the appropriate list as of May 1. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIf we increase the rate and intervene early, will that increase rates somewhere \nelse,  increase  the  waitlist  and  document  the  savings  to  which  Ms.  Bortolin \nalluded to offset the increased rate? Do we recognize the reality if we treat \nmore, it is going to cost more. It may cost less, but I am not sure it is going to \noffset later expenses as much as the investment. I do not want to go down the \nroad of pretending it will, if it will not. I am not opposed to proceeding, but I do \nnot want people disappointed that we may not save as much as the optimistic \nprojection.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe will probably get a fiscal note for this bill that may address some of those \nissues, but the sponsor should speak to this. \n \nSENATOR OHRENSCHALL: \nThe  Audit  indicated  we  did  less  with  more  resources  that  were  not  spent \nappropriately. I am optimistic we can allot those resources as planned, and that \nit will lead to savings for the State. Children on Medicaid can get these services \nyounger and earlier. This has been one of the most thorough audits I have ever \nread,  and  the  recommendations  give  us  a  clear  path  of  how  to  fix  these \nproblems. I am optimistic it will lead to savings when we get those resources \nspent where they should be spent. \n \nCOMMISSIONER OSTROVSKY: \nI want to make clear that providers working with children who used Medicaid as \ntheir primary insurance are no longer taking Medicaid. These children are getting \nno intervention. It does not mean our State does not take care of them later in \nlife. We will be spending millions of dollars looking for group homes or trying to \ntake care of these children. Early intervention and access to that intervention is \nimportant, and we cannot offer that now. I know of four groups that dropped in \nDecember, and two of our largest providers that provide services nationwide no \nlonger take Medicaid in Nevada. We need to get the providers to get these \nchildren help. Early intervention means maybe they can learn to learn, go to \npublic school, lead productive lives and control dangerous behaviors so we do \nnot  need  an  autism  court.  That  is  where  this  becomes  key  and  incredibly \nimportant. \n \nSTEVEN COHEN: \nI support S.B. 96. \n \nYESENIA SERRATO GONZALES (Founder and Member, Azulblue United by Autism): \nI support S.B. 96. I come to you as an autistic mother of an amazing son who \nalso has autism. I have submitted my written testimony (Exhibit K). \n \nADAM HARRIS (Chief Operating Officer, Las Vegas Autism Center): \nWe support S.B. 96. We are a behavioral services agency in Las Vegas. We are \nhere to ensure eligible individuals with autism throughout the State gain access \nto services they have a right to by law. The main barrier to access is Medicaid \nfunding  for  ABA  therapy  does  not  support  the  growth  or  sustainability  for \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nbusinesses providing these services. We have supporting testimony (Exhibit L) \nand  financial  data  (Exhibit  M)  illustrating  rates  for  RBTs  and  BCBAs,  using \nmodels for four different rates. \n \nHAYLEY HUBER: \nI support S.B. 96. I am a mother of two children on the autism spectrum. I have \nsubmitted my written testimony (Exhibit N). \n \nLENISE KRYK, M.ED., BCBA, LBA (Director, The Lovass Center): \nWe support S.B. 96. I am proud of serving the autism community in Nevada for \nalmost 20 years. Last summer, I was appointed to the Nevada Commission on \nAutism Spectrum Disorders. I have provided written testimony (Exhibit O). \n  \nJANELLE SAUNDERS, BCBA, LBA: \nI support S.B. 96.  \n \nPAM BEREK: \nI support S.B. 96. I have a 19-year-old son with multiple disabilities, one of \nwhich was not diagnosed until later in his life. I have submitted my written \ntestimony and photographs (Exhibit P). \n \nJON PAUL SAUNDERS, M.Ed., BCBA, LBA: \nI support S.B. 96. I have provided written testimony (Exhibit Q). \n \nNANETTE EIDELBERG: \nI support S.B. 96. I thank Allen and Jan Crandy, former Chair of the Nevada \nCommission  on  Autism  Spectrum  Disorders,  who  advocated  for  autism \nprograms such as ATAP which helps improve the lives of children diagnosed \nwith autism, including my daughter. There was a time we did not know if she \nwould ever talk or be able to answer a question. My daughter is a 12-year-old, \nin the sixth grade, who was diagnosed with autism, labeled nonverbal, and had \nself-injurious behaviors. Nevada provided funding. From therapy through The \nLovass Center, she no longer throws tantrums but makes eye contact, reads, \nwrites, does math, is a model student in the classroom and has a better quality \nof life overall. \n \nWe could be in danger of losing our provider because of our low Medicaid rates. \nOur community has already lost providers and therapists, and puts children on \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \nlong waiting lists to receive ABA. Passing this bill gives our children a fighting \nchance of becoming self-sufficient and self-advocating adults. \n \nGWEN  DWIGGINS,  Ph.D.,  BCBA-D,  LBA  (Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Founder, \nAccelerated Learning Clinic): \nI  support  S.B.  96.  I  have  provided  services  for  over  25  years,  8 years  in \nNevada. I have submitted written testimony (Exhibit R). \n \nKENNETH  KILLINGSWORTH,  PH.D.,  BCBA  (Clinical  Director,  Helix  Behavioral \nServices): \nI  support  S.B.  96.  I  am  a  BCBA  who  owns  and  operates  Helix  Behavioral \nServices in Reno. I have submitted written testimony (Exhibit S). \n \nTERRA BASS: \nI  support  S.B.  96  and  have  submitted  written  testimony  (Exhibit  T).  After \ncountless  meetings  with  different  physicians,  I  was  told  my  two-year-old \ndaughter,  Quinn,  would  never  walk  without  assistance  and  would  need \nintensive  support.  She  was  diagnosed  with  Autism  Spectrum  Disorder  and \nstarted ABA. Applied behavior analysis helped her take her first steps, and she \nbegan running and making independent choices at three years old. Today, she is \nfour years old and finding her voice. Needless to say, she is defying the odds \nand making leaps and bounds through ABA. Quinn faces more challenges than \nmost children which is why this therapy is so crucial to her development. Early \ntreatment reduces the need for care later on in life. \n \nMy daughter and other autistic individuals should have the opportunity to reach \ntheir full potential just like everyone else. Medicaid rates do not allow my child \nto get the full support she needs. Due to this, she is falling further behind her \npeers  when  she  could  be  climbing.  Increasing  rates  for  ABA  will  increase \nqualified  providers,  allowing  greater  access  to  medically  necessary  services. \nThis bill is crucial to better the lives and meet the growing needs of autistic \nindividuals in Nevada. \n \nANDREW  MACKAY  (Executive  Director,  Nevada  Franchised  Auto  Dealers \nAssociation): \nWe support S.B. 96. This issue is near and dear to many of our members' \nhearts who dug deep in their pockets to support treatment of autism spectrum \ndisorders. This bill will allow more providers to accept Medicaid contracts, and \nmost importantly, increase access to services for children.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \nDESIRAE WINGERTER, BCBA: \nI am in support of S.B. 96. I am testifying as an advocate for those individuals \nwith  different  abilities  and  the  professionals  who  serve  them.  I  am  also  a \nrepresentative of Collaboration Center Foundation. I share my support for the \ncritical passage of this bill. At its current reimbursement rate, the lowest in the \nNation, the majority of ABA providers cannot sustain their businesses, and this \ntrickle-down effect results in increased waitlists, RBT turnover, lost jobs and, \nmost importantly, individuals with autism not receiving the services they need \nand  deserve.  It  is  time  for  Nevada  to  fully  support  our  most  vulnerable \npopulation. \n \nMARIA LOPEZ: \nI  support  S.B.  96.  I  am  a  parent  of  two  children  with  autism.  My  son  is \nnonverbal. My biggest fear is not having the ABA services we acquired when he \nwas  a  three-year-old.  I  cannot  express  the  pain  a  parent  suffers  when  you \nwatch  your  child  go  through  such  extreme,  violent  behavior  such  as  biting \nhimself and banging his head on hard surfaces. These are definite behaviors that \nneed  professional  care  and  support,  and  that  is  ABA.  There  was  testimony \nearlier that a child with similar behaviors did not receive early ABA. We would \nbe the alternative case. Since acquiring our ABA, we have not seen any of \nthose violent, self-harming behaviors. This life-saving and life-changing therapy \ntransforms children and increases their abilities. They have hope, and it gives a \nchance for families who have ABA services. I plead with you to pass this bill. \n \nALDEN GRANT: \nI support S.B. 96. At 26 months, I was diagnosed with severe autism, but \nthanks  to  an  early  and  intensive  ABA  treatment  program,  I  am  now  a \nfunctioning adult able to do normal things. \n \nJACQUELYN NADER: \nWe support S.B. 96. I am here to testify on behalf of Ellen Whittemore and \nsubmit a support statement from Chase Whittemore (Exhibit U), who could not \nbe here tonight. Some of you may know her as the Executive Vice President and \nGeneral Counsel for Wynn Resorts. Some of you may also know her for her \nparticipation and leadership as a board member for the Grant a Gift Autism \nFoundation, an organization that provides assessment and treatment funding for \nchildren, young adults and their families. Ellen's grandson has autism and has \ngreatly benefited from ABA. He has gone from completely nonverbal to now \npreparing for kindergarten this fall. The Whittemores are grateful and thankful \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \nfor  the  private  insurance  that  has  paid  for  his  extensive  treatment.  This \nimportant bill will allow children who are underinsured to receive the treatment \nthat has been so beneficial to Ellen's grandson. \n \nMICHELE TOMBARI: \nI support S.B. 96. I know that as a parent of a recovered child of autism, ABA \ntreatment needs to be accessible for all children in Nevada. I have submitted my \nwritten testimony (Exhibit V). \n \nSTELLA MONTILLO: \nI support S.B. 96. I am a mother of three children with autism. I used to live in \nMiami but moved to Nevada three years ago with the sole purpose of helping \nmy children because in Miami, there is not a lot of help for children with autism. \nI have provided my written testimony (Exhibit W). \n \nSARA MOORE, BCBA, LBA: \nI  support  S.B.  96.  I  have  a  family  member  who  came  to  Nevada  and  was \ndiagnosed  with  autism.  He  remained  on  a  waitlist  for  ABA  services  for \nfour years. Families should not have to wait that long for services in Nevada. \n \nSARAH ALSHAIKH: \nI support S.B. 96. I am a mental health therapist and mother to a three-year-old \nboy who has a rare genetic disorder and moderate autism. My hope is that with \nan increase in reimbursement rates, more providers will accept Medicaid. My \nfamily  is  fortunate  to  have  private  insurance,  but  those  with  only  Medicaid \nstruggle with waiting for a year or more on waitlists. Applied behavior analysis \ncan be the foundation for a myriad of skills. Many young children struggle with \neye contact, a critical skill that needs to develop early for social abilities and \nspeech. When a child is engaged in interacting, social cognitive skills increase. \nSocial cognitive skills in children can not only be the ability to learn but the \nability to adopt the perspective of others and engage in prosocial behaviors like \nempathy and cooperation. Eye contact is the foundation for a child to become a \nproductive member of society. Applied behavior analysis helps with that, and a \nchild should not have to wait a year or more for this kind of help. If more \nproviders accept Medicaid, more children will receive treatment. \n \nJENNIFER THOMAS, BCBA, LBA: \nI support S.B. 96. I work as a behavioral analyst in Fallon and serve an area of \nover 50,000 square miles. I travel from Gerlach to Tonopah and Dayton to \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 27 \n \nLovelock. Due to the rural population I see, over 90 percent of my clients are on \nMedicaid and, unfortunately, are not getting enough high quality services. This \nis because I cannot recruit or retain RBTs in the rural areas due primarily to \nreimbursement rates that are too low to compete with business locales such as \nTesla and others that offer higher pay than our reimbursement. \n \nThis is what we are offering families who have nowhere else to turn and need \nservices for their children. As a BCBA, Medicaid will give me six hours per \nweek, maximum, for one-on-one work with these clients. If I was to find RBTs, \nthese clients would get at least 30 hours per week, depending on their severity \nand treatment plans. I encourage you to think about the families in the rural \nareas, who do not have the ability to travel to large metropolitan areas such as \nLas Vegas or Reno, and ensure they can get the much-needed access to their \nservices. \n \nMICHELLE CANNING, BCBA, LBA (Owner, Crossroads Behavior Consultation): \nI support S.B. 96. I am requesting your support and sponsorship of this bill to \nincrease the Medicaid reimbursement rate for ABA service. I have submitted my \nwritten testimony (Exhibit X). \n \nCHRIS HOLCOMB, PH.D., BCBA-D: \nI support S.B. 96. I have been training behavior analysts for 20 years as well as \nspeech  language  pathologists.  Over  the  past  year,  we  trained  over \nten individuals as BCBAs, and half of them have left the State. We need to \nincrease the rates we pay these analysts, not only to keep them in Nevada but \nalso to attract new BCBAs to the State to help children who are in dire need of \nservices. We receive nearly ten calls per day from families looking for services \nthat we cannot provide due to the rates. Our average rate is $25 per hour, and \nwe range from $23 to $27 per hour. Please pass S.B. 96. \n \nDANNENE DRUMMOND, BCBA, LBA (Owner, Snowflakes ABA, LLC): \nI support S.B. 96. I am in the unique position of being a mother to a 19-year-old \nson with autism who is receiving Nevada Medicaid benefits, and I own an ABA \ncompany in Maryland. I have submitted my written testimony (Exhibit Y). \n \nSENATOR OHRENSCHALL: \nI have seen one of the callers, Alden Grant, grow up and how much the ABA \ntherapy has helped him. I saw him earn his Eagle Scout badge and become a \nsuccessful young adult. That is the kind of difference ABA therapy can make. If \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 28 \n \nthe  bill  does  move  forward  I  ask  the  Committee  to  consider  one  additional \namendment  to  add  Assemblywoman  Teresa  Benitez-Thompson  as  a  primary \nsponsor. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAre you anticipating any other amendments? \n \nSENATOR OHRENSCHALL: \nNo. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 96. I will open the hearing on S.B. 326. \n \nSENATE  BILL  326:  Revises  provisions  relating  to  providers  of  health  care. \n(BDR 54-614) \n \nSENATOR JOSEPH P. HARDY (Senatorial District No. 12): \nSenate Bill 326 is about telehealth. On April 1, 2020, the Governor declared a \nDeclaration  of  Emergency  Directive  11  due  to  the  Covid-19  pandemic.  The \nfocus  was  to  register  providers  from  other  states  to  come  to  Nevada  via \ntelehealth and take care of people who live in Nevada. Directive 11 waived \nlicensing requirements, including requirements relating to telehealth, for skilled \nmedical professionals. Out-of-state providers would register with the Board of \nMedical Examiners or other boards without a fee and perform telehealth from \ntheir location in another state or territory.  \n \nSection 8 starts with electronic forms to apply for the issuance or renewal of \nlicensing. The forms must not contain any language that could be interpreted to \ndiscourage or threaten applicants from applying for licensure. The forms must \ninclude a statement welcoming the applicant to this State. Section 9 mirrors the \nState Board of Osteopathic Medicine with the Board of Medical Examiners that \nlicenses  allopathic  professionals  so  NRS  633  mirrors  NRS  630.  We  also \nrecognize  people  who  are  applying  for  networks  with  insurance  carriers  to \npractice in Nevada. A form on the internet that physicians who are applying can \nfill out will advise acceptance or denial, and the reason why, which would be \nconfidential. One of the problems some may have is concerns if the applicant \nlied,  we  can  revoke  that  registration  because  he  or  she  is  not  licensed  in \nNevada. That, in essence, is the bill. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 29 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSection 4, subsection 3 states \"Registration issued pursuant to this section \nexpires 1 year after the date of issuance and is not renewable.\" Can they only \ndo this once and for a year? \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe theory is yes. If they are not going to come to Nevada, then we are done \nbecause we need them here. If they want to come here, they will apply and be \nlicensed. This registration is one and done as opposed to a license. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWill they be able to get their licenses within a year? \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThey may apply any time during that year. I am optimistic that if they want to \ncome, they can start that license procedure any time they want. They do not \nhave to wait until their registration runs out. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIf they start the very first day, are we confident that on the 365th day they will \nhave a license in hand? \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe Board of Medical Examiners is hearing us as we speak, and it is motivated \nto act more expeditiously with an online application so the form does not go \nback and forth repeatedly. I am optimistic they will to do that within a year. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWhat happens if the Board does not? \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe  applicant  loses  the  registration  but  can  still  participate  in  the  license \napplication, however long that takes. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nDoes anything in the bill allow those who go through the registration process to \ngo  through  an  abbreviated  licensing  process  given  we  do  not  have  all  the \ninformation  but  a  good  amount  of  it?  Would  they  have  to  go  through  the \nlicensing process as if we have never seen them before? \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 30 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThey would have to go through the licensing process. This does not preclude \nanything, it just makes it easier to apply. When they are coming from another \nstate and duly licensed with a clean record, then they already have done much \nof the work that puts them in a position to go through the licensing process. \nThese doctors also have the opportunity to look at the endorsement process and \nthrough  the  Federation  of  State  Medical  Boards,  they  will  have  some  other \ntools. For instance, the Air Force doctor I spoke with was quickly registered and \nlicensed in Nevada because these organizations are the ones that keep all the \nrecords and can get them to the Board of Medical Examiners quickly. When we \nstart talking to these doctors, I recommend we give them those hints of what \nthey can do to facilitate coming to Nevada on a permanent basis. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nAre other states doing something like this? \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWe heard from New York, which put a plea out for doctors and nurses to come \nto their state, and people went there. I am not sure of the exact process, but \nthey did not have time to apply for full licensure. Other states have opened their \nborders for opportunities to practice, but I do not know if any of them have \ndone it as quickly, wherein doctors are using the broad stroke, as Governor \nSteve Sisolak did for us. He literally opened doors to get doctors involved, and \nabout 1,400 doctors applied for the waiver. I do not know yet how many took \nadvantage of the telehealth registration, but it has become a place where we \ncan recruit. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nHow will this work when Nevada becomes a member of the Interstate Medical \nLicensure Compact? \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nNevada is already a member. It will make it easier for anyone to come, whether \nthey have the registration or not. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nHow many different provider types would fall under this bill? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 31 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIn the Board of Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine, \nyou have physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, perfusionists and \nrespiratory  therapists.  The  Governor  also  opened  it  up  for  behavioral  health \noccupations. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe bill says it is any provider of health care, it is not limited to physicians. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe Governor did a pretty broad stroke. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nSome  restrictions  in  the  registration  process  exclude  individuals  with  any \ndisciplinary measures levied against them and those held civilly or criminally \nliable for malpractice. Do you expect the Boards to investigate if any of that is \ntrue or is it just a statement of affirmation in the application and registration \nprocesses? \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIt is an affirmation. The difference is if our Board wanted to make one call to \ntheir board, it would be different than sending off for copies of their original \nclinical education rotations from the third and fourth year of medical school, \ninternship and on and on. Our Board can pick up the phone and ask about any \nadverse actions against that doctor. That would be one phone call instead of \nmany sheets of paper, copies and faxes going back and forth. A totally different \nsystem would take place when the doctor applies for a real license. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nDoes anything indicate people who want to practice remotely into Nevada via \ntelehealth would be interested in relocating? \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI am optimistic that may happen; if there is one provider, there may be more. \nAmong people who are in Idaho, Elko and border towns, someone is going to \nsay \"Why do I want to live in another state when I can live in Nevada.\" \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 32 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nTo follow up on Senator Kieckhefer's question and the border town concept, I \nam stuck on the one year. From a patient's perspective, if you are in one of \nthose border towns and it is helpful for you to have this as a patient, you have \ncreated a behavioral health relationship with a provider on telehealth for a year. \nThen that provider decides to not move to Nevada. Why would we want to \nsuspend that relationship? \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWe do not want to suspend that relationship. I am basing this on the Governor's \nemergency directive. If that emergency directive could be amended into this bill, \nI am amenable to that because he ends up with the bill anyway, and it could be \ndone. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe  emergency  directive  ends  at  some  point.  If  your  answer  is  you  are \namending it into this bill, then this ends at some point. Is this bill a reaction to \nan emergency? I am still struggling with why there is a one-year limit. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe Governor's directive was one year, and that is where it came from. If we \nwanted to do something else and go through the legislative process to change \nthat kind of opportunity, we could do that. I suspect he would be amenable. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWhen is the bill effective? \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIt is in the language of the bill. If not spelled out, it is October. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nPage 11 says it is upon passage for the approval of adopting any regulations \nand January 1, 2022, for anything else. This will buy us one year's worth of \ntelehealth  professionals.  Why  is  it  necessary  to  have  the  bill  require  no \nthreatening language? \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe State is at the bottom of the number of physicians. The Board of Medical \nExaminer's licensing application has negative language. We wanted to avoid \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 33 \n \nthat so we took more positive words from Arizona and Utah's applications and \nput that language in the bill because we want to invite people as opposed to \nscare people. No matter who it is, we are going to investigate them and make \nsure they qualify. I have a problem with negative versus positive language. \n \nDAVID DAZLICH (Southern Nevada Forum on Health Care): \nWe  support  S.B.  326.  It  is  a  priority  to  increase  access  to  telehealth  by \nstreamlining the licensing process for doctors within Nevada.  \n \nKEITH LEE (Board of Medical Examiners): \nWe are neutral for S.B. 326. The Board has filed a fiscal note with a detailed \nexplanation.  The  Board  has  several  questions  regarding  this  bill.  I  have \nsubmitted my written testimony (Exhibit Z). \n \nSUSAN FISHER (State Board of Osteopathic Medicine): \nWe are neutral for S.B. 326. We agree with the comments made by Mr. Lee on \nbehalf  of  the  Board  of  Medical  Examiners;  however,  we  have  a  few  other \npoints.  This  is  not  streamlining  the  licensing  process,  it  is  the  registration \nprocess. It is a free registration. We will still have to do the same background \nchecks and have staff time to call other states; those costs go on the backs of \nother licensees. We are a fee-based organization and receive no General Funds. \nIt is going to cost dollars to do this. We will have a fiscal note as well. \n \nThere  are  24  states  that  are  members  of  the  Interstate  Medical  Licensure \nCompact,  of  which  Nevada  is  a  member.  We  are  already  streamlined  for \nlicensing. Our Board meets monthly to review license applications quickly, and \nour process is online. We are charged with protecting the public and making \nsure the person is qualified to practice in Nevada and take care of Nevadans. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nCould our Legal Counsel speak to the caller's question about the remedy if \nregistration information is false? \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nSection 4, subsection 4, paragraph (c), states: \n \nA regulatory body may revoke a registration issued pursuant to this \nsection  or  impose  other  disciplinary  action  against  a  registrant \nunder the same circumstances and in accordance with the same \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 34 \n \nprocedure as applies to a person who is licensed or certified in this \nState.  \n \nWhatever the Board of Medical Examiners can do to a licensee who was found \nto have submitted false information, the Board can do to a registrant. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDoes anything in this bill either allow or prohibit the boards subject to this bill to \nwrite regulations that would address the other questions about fingerprints and \nverification? \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nSection 4, subsection 2, paragraphs (b) and (c) state: \"A regulatory body shall \nissue  a  registration  pursuant  to  subsection  1  upon  the  application  of  an \napplicant who: has not been disciplined or investigated by the corresponding \nregulatory  authority\"  and  \"has  not  been  held  civilly  or  criminally  liable  for \nmalpractice.\" They could potentially conduct a background check for the limited \npurpose of determining whether the applicant has been held criminally liable for \nmalpractice. Beyond that, they could not deny registration for any other reason \nnot specifically stated in section 4, subsection 2 of the bill. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI would appreciate understanding the broader group of healthcare professionals \nif you could provide us with a list of which professionals this applies to and \nwhich boards provide the licensing for those professionals. I understand the \ninclination to make the registration process free, but I am concerned about the \nsmaller boards. It sounds like we will have some fiscal notes coming forward. \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nThe  list  includes  any  provider  of  health  care  as  defined  in  NRS  629.031: \nphysician; physician's assistant; dentist; nurse; emergency medical personnel; \ndispensing  optician;  optometrist;  speech-language  pathologist;  audiologist; \npractitioner  of  respiratory  care;  physical  therapist;  occupational  therapist; \npodiatrist;  psychologist;  marriage  and  family  counselor;  clinical  professional \ncounselor;  music  therapist;  chiropractor;  athletic  trainer;  doctor  of  oriental \nmedicine;  medical  laboratory  director  or  technician;  pharmacist;  licensed \ndietician;  social  worker;  alcohol  and  drug  counselor;  and  problem  gambling \ncounselor. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 35 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nSection 3 refers to NRS 629.510 and NRS 629.515 which deal with telehealth. \nThese may be different than some of the other ones; however, I do not know \nwhich ones are not allowed to telehealth. Section 4, subsection 1, states the \ntelehealth provider has to be licensed or certified in another state, District of \nColumbia, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or a territory under the jurisdiction of \nthe U.S. Section 4, subsection 4, paragraph (c) may revoke the registration. It is \nmore stringent in its ability to do something of a negative consequence. \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nI would like to make one clarification. When I listed the providers of health care, \nthat  is  for  the  telehealth  registration.  If  they  cannot  provide  services  by \ntelehealth, the electronic registration only applies to the medical examiners and \nosteopathic medical examiners. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nMr. Robbins, I would appreciate if you could help us with a list of who can do \ntelehealth so we could get a handle on which boards this would impact. \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nYes, I will. \n \n \nRemainder of page intentionally left blank; signature page to follow.   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 36 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 326. There being no public testimony, I will \nadjourn the meeting at 8:12 p.m. \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nNorma Mallett, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE: _______________________________________ \n   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 37 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nExhibit  Begins \nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \nLetter  on Page \n  A  1    Agenda \nS.B. 146  B  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 154  C  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 168  D  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 274  E  1  Senator Julia Ratti  Conceptual Amendment \nBailey Bortolin / \nS.B. 274  F  1  Nevada Coalition of  Senate Bill 293 Report \nLegal Service Providers \nSenator James \nS.B. 96  G  1  Audit Report \nOhrenschall \nAssemblywoman \nS.B. 96  G  1  Teresa Benitez- Audit Report \nThompson \nSenator James \nS.B. 96  H  1  Conceptual Amendment \nOhrenschall \nAssemblywoman \nS.B. 96  H  1  Teresa Benitez- Conceptual Amendment \nThompson \nJulie Ostrovsky / \nNevada Commission on \nS.B. 96  I  1  Support Testimony \nAutism Spectrum \nDisorders \nJulie Ostrovsky / \nNevada Commission on \nS.B. 96  J  1  Presentation \nAutism Spectrum \nDisorders \nYesenia Serrato \nS.B. 96  K  1  Gonzales / Azulblue  Support Statement \nUnited by Autism \nAdam Harris / Las  Support Statement of Molly \nS.B. 96  L  1 \nVegas Autism Center  Halligan \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 38 \n \nAdam Harris / Las \nS.B. 96  M  1  Presentation \nVegas Autism Center \nS.B. 96  N  1  Hayley Huber  Support Statement \nLenise Kryk / The \nS.B. 96  O  1  Support Statement \nLovass Center \nS.B. 96  P  1  Pam Berek  Support Statement \nS.B. 96  Q  1  Jon Paul Saunders  Support Statement \nGwen Dwiggins / \nS.B. 96  R  1  Accelerated Learning  Support Statement  \nClinic \nKen Killingsworth / \nS.B. 96  S  1  Helix Behavioral  Support Statement \nServices \nS.B. 96  T  1  Terra Bass  Support Statement \nSupport Statement of Chase \nS.B. 96  U  1  Jacquelyn Nader \nWhittemore \nS.B. 96  V  1  Michele Tombari  Support Statement \nS.B. 96  W  1  Stella Montillo  Support Statement \nMichelle Canning / \nS.B. 96  X  1  Crossroads Behavior  Support Statement \nConsultation \nDannene Drummond / \nS.B. 96  Y  1  Support Statement \nSnowflakes ABA \nKeith Lee / Board of \nS.B. 326  Z  1  Neutral Statement \nMedical Examiners \n ", "54": "\nMINUTES OF THE  \nSENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n \nEighty-first Session \nMarch 30, 2021 \n \n \nThe Senate Committee on Health and Human Services was called to order by \nChair Julia Ratti at 3:42 p.m. on Tuesday, March 30, 2021, Online.

(BDR 40-955) \n \nSENATOR FABIAN DONATE (Senatorial District No. 10): \nI will read from my written remarks (Exhibit B). \n \nOLIVIA WHITELEY (Refugee Advocacy Lab): \nI will read from my written testimony (Exhibit C) as I review the presentation \n(Exhibit  D)  from  the  Refugee  Advocacy  Lab.  Also,  for  your  review,  are  the \nproposed amendment to S.B. 318 (Exhibit E), the Language Access Assessment \nand Planning Tool (Exhibit F) and the Department of Health and Human Services \nLanguage Access Policies (Exhibit G). \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe requirements of S.B 318 are for any and all languages. Are there thresholds \nfor the top ten languages spoken? I am wondering about the workload for the \nState  agencies  and  getting  this  done  if  we  are  targeting  the  pandemic  and \nemergency declarations in the first few sections of the bill. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nSENATOR DONATE: \nThe intention of S.B 318 is whatever is reasonable to help us navigate the \nCovid-19  pandemic.  There  are  many  languages  around  the  world  and  many \nspoken in Nevada. As we start to vaccinate more people, it will be harder to \nreach those who do not want to be vaccinated or are on the verge of deciding \nthis is what is best for them. For us to provide accurate information to those \nindividuals,  this  needs  to  be  done  in  a  manner  that  respects  their  native \nlanguage. \n \nMS. WHITELEY: \nAny requirement that an agency determines they must serve an individual with \nlimited English proficiency (LEP) is proportionate to the language of the clients \nthey serve. That determination begins with the agencies gathering data through \nthe Covid-19 language access plan provisions on what the languages are of the \nindividuals they serve. There is not a blanket mandate that all agencies must \nserve all languages, it is dependent on the needs of the clients of each individual \nagency. \n \nThe amended version of the bill sets the standard to be that an agency must \ntake reasonable steps to ensure meaningful access. That is a flexible standard \nthat agencies must follow and is consistent with what is required in federal law. \n \nThe Covid-19 provisions are dependent upon appropriation of federal funds. The \nreasonable  steps  an  agency  would  take  would  also  be  dependent  on  what \nfederal funding is allocated for these particular activities. Similarly, that would \nbe true with the language access plan provisions. The implementation questions \nof  those  plans  and  policies  will  not  be  discussed  until  the  2023 Legislative \nSession. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nDoes  section  8  of  the  bill  kick  in  two  years  after  the  termination  of  the \nGovernor’s Emergency Directive? \n \nMS. WHITELEY: \nSection  8  only  removes  the  requirement  that  revisions  of  agency  language \naccess plans must include an evaluation of how the agency addresses language \naccess needs during Covid-19. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nFor the first two years following the Governor’s termination of his Emergency \nDirective, the agencies are required to do a retrospective look at how they \nperformed during the pandemic, correct? \n \nMS. WHITELEY: \nThat is correct. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWhen the bill references the Division, it says this is an unfunded mandate on the \nlocal governments, not the State, so the local governments are going to be held \naccountable. Which Division are we looking at? \n \nMS. WHITELEY: \nSection 2 of the bill requires the Division of Public and Behavioral Health to \nimplement the Covid-19 related provisions. Sections 3 and 4 require local health \ndistricts or departments to implement those provisions. \n \nIn the proposed amendment, Exhibit E, section 3, subsection 6, and section 4, \nsubsection 6 state “This shall be implemented to the extent that funding is \navailable”. The intent is that those provisions only become operative if monies \nfrom the American Rescue Plan are allocated for these purposes. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nSo this does include the State as well as the Health District of the largest \ncounty. \n \nMS. WHITELEY: \nYes, it does. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe  Additional  Provision  portion  at  the  top  of  the  proposed  amendment, \nExhibit E, is not incorporated into one of the sections of the bill. What is the \nintent of that section? The statement, “State assisted programs” meaning all \nprograms that receive state funding is a lot. Is this specifically related to public \nhealth or does it include everything the State does? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nSENATOR DONATE: \nThe  intent  of  the  bill  is  divided  into  two  parts.  The  first  part  is  Covid-19 \noriented, and the second part is to revise the services we provide as a State and \nany needs and gaps. Also, to look at those gaps, see what we can improve, use \nthese two years to identify what the gaps are, and in a future session, and if \nrequests are warranted, make allocations to solve those disparities. \n \nMS. WHITELEY: \nThe  intent  of  the  additional  general  provision  is  to  provide  local  districts \nadditional  flexibility  in  implementation  of  the  Covid-19  provisions  and  give \nagencies  the  flexibility  in  the  implementation  of  the  language  access  plan \nprovisions. The standard to make reasonable effort, or to take reasonable steps \nto provide meaningful access, is the standard we are looking toward in order to \nallow agencies that flexibility. \n \nIn terms of the definitions of State assisted programs, this is modeled after the \nexisting federal requirement that any federally conducted or federally assisted \nprograms are required to assure language access from any subcontractors or \ngrantees. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIs this the language you have inserted into the different sections, or is it stand \nalone as a piece of the statute? \n \nMS. WHITELEY: \nIt is drafted to do both. First, as an additional general standard set for the \nagencies both in terms of the language access plan and Covid-19 provision. \nSecond, it is to be integrated throughout the language of the bill. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nTo Senator Kieckhefer’s point, will this apply to all State agencies that receive \nState funding? \n \nMS. WHITELEY: \nThe Covid-19 provisions will only apply to the Division of Public and Behavioral \nHealth and the local county health districts or departments. The requirement to \ndraft, not to implement, a language access plan will apply to all State agencies. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nCan you delineate which sections of the bill do or do not relate to Covid-19? \n \nMS. WHITELEY: \nSections  2,  3  and  4  are  Covid-19  related  and  section  7  is  related  to  the \nlanguage access plan drafting requirement. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe State assisted programs are only in sections 2, 3 and 4 for Covid-19? \n \nMS. WHITELEY: \nThe  State  assisted  requirement  would  fall  under  section  7  which  requires \nagencies to develop the language access plan. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nDoes the sentence relating to the language access plan drafting requirement \nbelong to section 7 of the bill? \n \nMS. WHITELEY: \nYes. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nCan you give an example of a state that has a good language access plan? \n \nMS. WHITELEY: \nThere are states that have introduced similar legislation as well as the Division \nof Child and Family Services. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIs this the exhibit on the legislative website, Exhibit G, from the Department of \nHealth and Human Services (DHHS)? \n \nMS. WHITELEY: \nYes. Pages 1 and 6 of the presentation set out the two policies from Division of \nChild and Family Services we think are the most developed and reflect the \ndirection of what we would like to see through this piece of legislation. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nMANUEL MEDEROS: \nAs the Language Access Specialist for the Northern Nevada International Center \nin Reno, I support S.B. 318 because it is critical that each Nevada agency is \nable to create their own language access plan. This plan will help State agencies \nmeet  the  language  needs  of  Nevadans  experiencing  significant  barriers  to \naccessing State services related to Covid-19 due to the lack of materials and \ninformation translated. \n \nThe  Covid-19  pandemic  has  disrupted  nearly  every  aspect  of  our  lives  and \nreached into almost every community in our  State. The ability to keep one \nanother safe and healthy depends on every Nevadan having access to credible \ninformation about how to prevent the spread of Covid-19, the types of support \nand services available, and how to comply with federal, State and local orders. \n \nWe know certain communities are disproportionally impacted by this pandemic. \nOne way we can shift that is by meeting our obligations to communicate in \nways acceptable, culturally and linguistically relevant. \n \nThe  Language  Bank  at  The  Northern  Nevada  International  Center  provides \n20 languages in person, 200 languages over the phone, and over 15 languages \nincluding American sign-language over video remote interpreting technology and \ndocumentation and translation in over 100 languages. All of these languages \nserve as just one example of the resources our State needs to stay culturally \nrelevant. Many State agencies do not have access to the diverse services the \nlanguage bank provides. Only Statewide planning and resources can expand \nlanguage access for all equitably. \n \nCovid-19 took my father’s life a few months ago. Many times, my father asked \nme to interpret for him as not all the doctors and nurses understood him and \nwere not able to communicate with him in his own language. We need S.B. 318 \nto ensure hundreds of communities can access life-saving information and care. \n \nDEBORAH SILVERA (Nevada Interpreters & Translators Association): \nThe  Nevada  Interpreters  &  Translators  Association  supports  S.B. 318.  As \nlanguage  access  professionals,  we  are  intimately  aware  of  the  need  for \nNevadans  with  LEP  to  have  access  to  all  information  regarding  government \nservices. This must include access to trained and qualified interpretation and \ntranslation  services  necessary  for  Nevadans  to  receive  accurate  and  vital \ninformation regarding government services. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nThe  use  of  machine  translation  aids  such  as  Google  Translate  can  lead  to \nunwanted  errors  in  conveying  the  intended  message.  This  can  range  from \ncomical to dangerous and serious communication. \n \nLikewise, the use of untrained bilingual persons to interpret for family members, \noften  minor  children,  is  not  only  dangerous  but  ethically  unsound. \nSenate Bill 318 supports this objective by requiring agencies to outline accurate \ncredentialing and oversight of translators as in additional requirements, training, \nincentive and recruiting initiatives to support interpreters and translators. \n \nTrained  and  qualified  language  access  services  are  more  critical  during  the \nCovid-19  crisis  where  a  lack  of  accurate  information  can  not  only  lead  to \nunwanted individual health consequences, but can have a catastrophic effect on \nthe community at large. All aspects of the public health effort to deal with \nCovid-19  require  an  informed  public  which  ranges  from  testing  to  masking, \nimmunizations and contract tracing. Senate Bill 318 requirements for additional \nCovid-19  language  resources  will  help  ensure  all  Nevadans  receive  accurate \ninformation about Covid-19 and will build trust between a populous that is often \nsuspicious of public health agencies and have suffered disproportionately from \nthe effects of the pandemic. \n \nCHLOE HSIA (Asian Community Development Council): \nThe  Asian  Community  Development  Council  supports  S.B. 318.  We  are  a \ncommunity  organization  serving  the  fastest  growing  community  in  Nevada, \nproviding  the  community  with  critical  resources  and  services  including  open \nenrollment navigators and our food bank, among others. Language access is a \ncrucial  part  of  our  work,  and  we  see  personally  the  gap  that  exists  in \ncommunicating critical public health information to the community. \n \nDuring  this  time  last  year,  we  translated  Covid-19  response  materials  in \nTagalog, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese and Thai. There is a lot of misinformation \non messaging sites, and providing expanded language access for everyone helps \nwith health equity. \n \nBUSHRA DOS SANTOS (Catholic Charities of Southern Nevada): \nThe Catholic Charities of Southern Nevada support S.B. 318. We are recognized \nas the State office for refugees. Through this program, we resettle hundreds of \nrefugees each year from around the world who have fled their homes due to \nwar  and  persecution.  In  2020,  we  served  over  1,200  refugee  clients.  Our \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nclients  speak  many  languages  including  Arabic,  Farsi,  Dari,  Swahili, \nKinyerwanda and many others. Although our office provides robust services and \nadequate interpretation to our refugee clients, S.B. 318 is vital in ensuring all \nrefugees  and  LEP  individuals  can  access  essential  services  across  all \ngovernment agencies. \n \nThe Covid-19 pandemic has amplified many challenges our refugees have in \naccessing these essential services. With a lack of adequate interpretation and \nlimited  office  availability  of  government  services  due  to  the  pandemic,  our \nrefugees have struggled with filing unemployment claims after being laid off, \nobtaining social security cards and applying for public assistance. In addition, \nthe lack of Covid-19 information available in the languages our refugee clients \nspeak, make it difficult to have equitable access to the same information their \nEnglish speaking counterparts have, barring them from accessing appropriate \ncare. \n \nStatewide planning and resources are necessary to enhance language access for \nnot only our refugee clients but all residents equitably. Senate Bill 318 is the \nfirst step in the process of identifying where the gaps in language services are \nand how they can be addressed to meet the growing needs of our population \nthat is becoming increasingly diverse. \n \nGILLIAN BLOCK (Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers): \nThe Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers supports S.B. 318. The legal \naid providers in Nevada frequently serve with LEP, and generally identifying and \naddressing language access gaps is extremely important. Language barriers that \nalready  exist  have  become  even  steeper  since  the  onset  of  the  pandemic. \nCovid-19 has made it clear that many areas for language access are critical. The \nhealth information necessary for people to keep themselves and their families \nsafe and prevent community spread has been rapidly evolving. \n \nAll Nevadans, regardless of language or national origins, should be able to learn \nabout and access this information and the vital services for which they are \neligible.  Improving  language  access  to  people  seeking  health  information, \nunderstanding public health recommendations, accessing testing, treatment and \nvaccine information is extremely important. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nBRADLEY MAYER (Southern Nevada Health District): \nThe Southern Nevada Health District is neutral on S.B. 318. We had expressed \nconcerns with how the bill was originally drafted. The proposed amendment, \nExhibit E, is more permissive and is contingent upon funding being available to \nexecute these new responsibilities. We will work with the sponsor to ensure the \nlanguage does not create an unfunded mandate should the funding fluctuate or \nnot be permanent. \n \nJOELLE GUTMAN DODSON (Washoe County Health District): \nThe  Washoe  County  Health  District  is  neutral  on  S.B. 318,  and  I  echo  the \ncomments from Mr. Mayer with the Southern Nevada Health District. \n \nSENATOR DONATE: \nI will read from my closing comments, Exhibit B. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 318 and open the hearing on S.B. 340. \n \nSENATE  BILL  340:  Revises  provision  relating  to  the  wages  and  working \nconditions of certain employees. (BDR 53-573) \n \nSENATOR DINA NEAL (Senatorial District No. 4): \nThe story of the home health care worker is compelling. A home health care \nworker took care of my father and was responsible for bathing him and placing \nhim in his pajamas. I was brought into a world where I understood the life of the \nsick  and  the  elderly.  We  were  in  a  different  position  than  most  when  we \ncontracted for services. Because of the pandemic, my daughter and I worked \nvirtually,  so  we  were  not  faced  with  having  to  physically  be  at  work  and \nmanage the care of a loved one. This is the reality for other families who do not \nhave the capacity to work remotely. \n \nThese home health care workers matter because they have become a part of a \ntiny  society  that  forms  when  people  exist  under  one  roof.  Our  ingress  and \negress revolves around the sick, and it is important these workers receive the \nproper training, transportation, reimbursement and other things listed in the bill. \nTaking care of the sick is something you will never imagine until you experience \nit and have to contract for services for an individual to come into your home \nthat  will  allow  you  the  two  or  four  hours  a  day  you  need  to  pick  up  a \nprescription or simply eat. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nOur focus was on one person. The two hours we contracted for a home health \ncare worker allowed us the time to schedule doctors’ appointments and the time \nto take care of the duties that worker could not do. \n \nFor the sick and elderly, the medicine reminders we think about today must \nremain  on  a  schedule,  and  this  medication  cannot  be  missed;  it  must  be \nconsistent. Our home health care worker was integral in helping us remember \nwhen  those  medications  were  needed  and  at  what  time  they  were  to  be \nadministered. \n \nGRACE  VERGARA-MACTAL,  (Executive Director,  Service  Employees  International \nUnion): \nI will read from my written testimony (Exhibit H) in support of S.B. 340. \n \nVANESSA TORTI (Senior Home Care Coordinator, Service Employees International \nUnion): \nI will read from my written testimony (Exhibit I) in support of S.B. 340 and the \nproposed amendment (Exhibit J). \n \nFARREN EPSTEIN: \nI will read from my written testimony (Exhibit K) in support of S.B. 340. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe State is one of the  more significant payers  of personal care assistants \nthrough our Medicaid and Home and Community Based Care waiver programs. \nWhat is interesting about S.B 340 is that everything is required by the Director \nof DHHS to perform investigations and make recommendations on pay. That \nsame individual needs to be conscientious about the State’s budget. It seems \nthat whoever is put in charge will be in a position of being the steward of the \npersonal care assistants in their professional situation. At the same time, they \nwill be the steward of the budget that might be the cause for the personal care \nassistant situation not being the best. Is it intentional that everyone engaged in \ndecisions is at the same table, or do you see any challenges in terms of the \nstructure? \n \nMS. TORTI: \nIn recognizing the tension of the situation, the unique thing we are trying to do \nis bring in voices that historically have not had a seat at the policy table. They \nneed  to  bring  the  perspective  of  the  employers  of  the  caregivers  and  the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nconsumers who have not been able to have an equal footing in speaking to the \nstructure of the Medicaid programs. It is particularly the people on the front line \nwho are doing the work and are getting these services every day that know \nmore about what needs to be done to fix home care in Nevada. It is time to \nlisten to them and make them a part of the solution. \n \nThe State’s oversight of this industry is disbursed over several State agencies. \nThey include Medicaid and Health Care Quality and Compliance as the licensing \nentity over personal care agencies. The Labor Commissioner is over general \nemployment. We need to bring in a multitude of voices and opinions in order to \ncome up with the right solutions for this workforce. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDo you see this more as a stakeholder engagement board or a labor relations \nboard? \n \nSENATOR NEAL: \nIt is set up to be both. One of the goals was to have a labor relations board \nbecause  of  the  wage  component,  which  is  why  they  wanted  the \nLabor Commissioner to be a part of it. We wanted to make sure if there was a \nwage issue, the Labor Commissioner would have authority. \n \nThe same concept was being considered for DHHS. Trying to find the home \nbest suited initially started off as a home under the Labor Commission, but \nseemed  it  was  better  suited  to  be  under  DHHS.  I  would  not  say  S.B  340 \nprovides a traditional board, but it is trying to manifest all the goals the Service \nEmployees International Union wanted by creating a blended task board. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWhat tipped the scales to having authorization given to DHHS as opposed to the \nLabor Commission? \n \nSENATOR NEAL: \nThe things to be done were better suited in terms of expertise for DHHS versus \nthe  Labor  Commission.  The  Labor  Commission  focuses  on  wages  and \nenforcement of failure to pay wages. It is better for DHHS to get involved with \nregard to the larger issues of employment standards for home care, training and \nsystemic impact around home care employees. Many of those provisions are in \nsections 16 and 17 of the bill. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nHave other states done similar things, and if so, what are the results? \n \nMS. TORTI: \nI can point out the states that have wage board-enabling statutes. They are not \nspecific to home care but have been used for other industries. They are Arizona, \nCalifornia, Colorado, New Jersey and New York. I am not able to speak to the \ndetails of those boards. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAre they wage board specific leaning toward the labor relations board concept \nrather than the stakeholder engagement concept? \n \nMs. TORTI: \nYes. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIs it common practice for wage boards to create differentiated minimum wages \nfor different types of employees in each state? \n \nMS. TORTI: \nThat  has  happened  under  the  wage  boards,  speaking  more  specifically  to \npractice in the home care industry. It is a practice within Medicaid in other \nstates to set specific wage and compensation standards for this industry. It is \ncommon practice to set what percentage of the Medicaid reimbursement rate \ncan be retained by the agency or what percent of the rate has to be passed on \nto a home health care worker in the form of compensation. Other states have \nset a specific minimum wage for home care workers. This has all been under \nthe guidance and approval of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n(CMS). \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe  proposal  before  us  would  set  a  minimum  wage  outside  of  Medicaid \nreimbursement.  It  would  be  inclusive  of  Medicaid  reimbursement  but  not \nexclusive to it, so it would be a minimum wage across the board for this job \nclassification, regardless of whether they work for a Medicaid client or not. \n \nMS. TORTI: \nThis would be specific to only publicly funded home care. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWhere in the bill is this stated? \n \nMS. TORTI: \nThe workforce is defined in section 5, subsection 1, paragraph (a). A home care \nemployee is a person who provides: “personal care services through a home \ncare program as an employee of a home care employer that is an agency to \nprovide personal care services in the home”. \n \nSection 8, subsection 1 states the: “’Home care program’ means a program \nestablished by a state agency or local government which provides in the home \npersonal care services…” \n \nThis section details the Medicaid State plan programs as examples of publicly \nfunded home care. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWhy is this a better way to state it than to say agencies must give 85 percent \nof their reimbursement rates to employees? \n \nMS. TORTI: \nIt  would  be  up  to  the  wage  board  to  decide  if  that  is  the  route  of  the \nrecommendation  around  compensation  for  home  care  workers.  It  does  not \nspecifically say a recommendation has to be around the minimum wage; it could \nbe a wage pass through as you described. \n \nTESS OPFERMAN (Nevada Women’s Lobby): \nThe  Nevada  Women’s  Lobby  supports  S.B. 340.  This  bill  will  help  families, \nseniors, women and people of color. Of the roughly 13,000 home care workers \nin Nevada, more than three-quarter are female, and over one-quarter are women \nof color. These workers make a median wage of $11 an hour, and a median \nincome of $15,500 per year. This leads to a high turnover rate in the home care \nindustry. Caring, qualified workers are leaving the profession at a rapid pace. \n \nWe  have  an  entire  workforce  trained  to  care  for  our  aging  parents  and \ngrandparents, allowing our family members to stay in their homes and get the \nservices they need. We have to pay a living wage. These workers must have \nestablished  training  regulations  and  receive  fair  pay  and  benefits. \nSenate Bill 340  is  a  key  solution  and  will  help  protect  these  workers.  This \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nmeans that those caring for our family members are well trained, experienced \nand invested in their jobs. \n \nPRISCILLA  MALONEY  (American  Federation  of  State,  County  and  Municipal \nEmployees): \nThe American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees support \nS.B. 340. We echo the comments of Ms. Opferman on behalf of the Nevada \nWomen’s Lobby. \n \nERMA HENDERSON: \nI support S.B. 340 as a home care worker in Las Vegas. During the pandemic, I \nworked without proper personal protective equipment and was afraid of being \ninfected and afraid I would bring Covid-19 home to my husband.  \n \nThis bill will help ensure home care workers are protected when facing future \nviruses or another public health crisis. With S.B. 340, we can make sure all \nhome care workers have the medical necessities to be safe. We urge you to \npass this bill so home care workers are adequately paid and receive the benefits \nthat are long overdue. Please respect us, protect us and pay us. \n \nTERRI LAIRD (Retired Public Employees of Nevada): \nRetired  Public  Employees  of  Nevada  support  S.B. 340.  As  we  age,  we \nsometimes need to receive specialized care, whether within the home where we \nare most comfortable or in a special care facility or hospital when necessary. \nWhen possible, care within our own homes is the preferable alternative and \nhighly qualified home care professional caregivers are essential to make that \npossible. The last year has pointed out the dangerous conditions that sometimes \npresent themselves in larger nursing home-type facilities where viruses can run \nrampant.  This  makes  in-home  care  more  preferable  when  possible. \nSenate Bill 340 seeks to create the home care workforce board needed in terms \nof working conditions for those that take care of seniors, the disabled and those \nunable to take care of themselves. \n \nDAWN RALENKOTTER: \nI support S.B. 340. I have been a home care worker for ten years. The low \nwage for home care workers in Nevada is $11.07 per hour. Most of us are \nstruggling to pay high out-of-pocket cost with the low wages we are paid. We \nare getting too few hours to give our clients the care they need. Senate Bill 340 \nwill help fix this problem. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nThe recertification training that I paid $40 for is not offered on a day that I can \nattend the class. I advised my client and employer about the need for a back-up \ncaregiver and was advised they would attempt to cover my client. I was signed \nup for the training but did not have anyone to cover my client. The training was \nnot what I expected, and I would like to know what that $40 paid for. This \noften happens with home care workers. My employer also wanted me to pay for \nfingerprints that had previously been paid for. I had to advocate for myself, \nletting my employer know they should be responsible for this cost. Every home \ncare worker cannot advocate for themselves to hold employers accountable. \nAgencies need more oversight, and as caregivers, we need a voice as frontline \nworkers. \n \nCAROL MATRONE: \nI  support  S.B. 340  for  myself  and  on  behalf  of  my  daughter  Maria  who  is \nchallenged and needs maximum care for her activities of daily living. She first \nreceived personal care services in 2000 after orthopedic surgery. She resides in \nan intensive supported living arrangement. She had 24/7 care from personal \ncare aids and direct support professionals through a subcontractor of Desert \nRegional Medical Center. I have been her unpaid caregiver for the last 30 years. \nI retired in 2020 from State service and dreamed of what retirement could be. \n \nIn  November,  we  both  had  four  Covid-19  tests.  We  had  near  misses  from \npersonal  care  attendants  who  traveled  to  numerous  clients  throughout  their \nworkday. When this occurred, the agencies would pull all providers from our \nhome, and I was the last care provider standing. At that time, I decided to \nbecome a paid caregiver. I cover four regular shifts as well as extra shifts when \nthere are no available personal care assistants. I am doing this physically taxing \njob at 63 years of age and my retirement is not a reality at this time. \n \nI am speaking on behalf of the hundreds of personal care attendants who have \nfiltered through my daughter’s life since 2000. These providers often travel to \n3 to 4 clients a day, all over the city, often working 10 to 14 hours a day to \nmake a living that can support them and their families, barely making ends \nmeet. Low pay, long hours, no travel stipends, inadequate training and no sick \nor paid time off plague these workers. They do not do this for the money, they \ndo  it  from  their  heart  and  soul  for  our  vulnerable  Nevadans.  Retention  and \nrecruitment  of  this  workforce  is  paramount  for  our  vulnerable  citizens  who \nreceive the most complex care. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nIn the future, you may need a caregiver, be a caregiver or hire a caregiver, and \nyour  loved  ones,  or  yourself,  deserve  one  who  is  respected,  protected  and \nearning a decent living wage. \n \nTYREE LOVE: \nI support S.B. 340. I have been a caregiver for 12 years, and I am proud of \nwhat I do. I want to provide a high quality of care to my clients so they can \nstay safely in their homes rather than going to a nursing home. This is what \nthey deserve, but it is hard to make a living at this profession. Even though \nhelping  senior  citizens  and  people  with  disabilities  has  never  been  more \nimportant during this pandemic, most of my clients do not receive adequate \nhours from the State to receive the level of care they deserve. \n \nIt is frustrating for me as a caregiver because I cannot deliver the quality of care \nI know my clients deserve. I have to drive all over the city to provide a couple of \nhours of care for one client and then rush to one after another. Senate Bill 340 \nwould  help  us  improve  the  quality  of  care  for  all  home  care  clients  and \n13,000 home care workers. It will provide workers and clients a seat at the \ntable and a voice to express their concerns about the service clients need. \n \nTRACEY RICHARDS: \nI support S.B. 340. I have been in the caregiving field for over 15 years. As a \nhome care worker, I am responsible for everything our clients cannot do for \nthemselves. Many of our clients no longer have family or friends to help them, \nso they depend on us for everyday tasks. This includes bathing, feeding, using \nthe bathroom, purchasing their groceries and cleaning around the house. My \nclients  are  getting  a  limited  number  of  hours  of  care  each  week.  What  is \nworrisome is that some of our clients do not always get the hours of care they \ndeserve. Unfortunately, in my experience it is the black clients experiencing \nthose  few  hours  of  care.  We  know  Black  people  face  inequalities  in  the \nhealthcare system in this Country. Covid-19 has affected the black communities \nmore than others. We cannot allow that to continue and repeat these injustices \nin the home care industry. Home care workers such as myself and my clients \nneed our voices heard and a seat at the table. \n \nIt is also a hardship for caregivers to pay for our fingerprints, tuberculosis tests, \nimmunizations, certification training, CPR and first aid training just to start a job. \nI recently began working at a new agency and did not have the $65 for the \nfingerprints that I just had done for my previous employer. This impacted me \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nand kept me from caring for my client. Passing S.B. 340 will allow us to work \nwith home care personal care agencies and the State to develop solutions to the \nserious inequalities many of us experience as home care workers and our clients \nface in their homes. \n \nROZETTA LOVE: \nI support S.B. 340. I have been a home care worker for 11 years. We do this \nwork because we care deeply about our clients and our community. We do not \nexpect to get rich doing it, but we deserve to be treated fairly, and our clients \ndeserve quality care. About half of home care workers cannot make a living \ndoing this job. It is my hope that we can create good quality jobs with livable \nwages so that the next generation of home care workers can proudly take care \nof our loved ones in need of care. \n \nCHERYL KNIGHT: \nI support S.B. 340. Our system for caregivers and clients who need them is \nbroken. This bill will provide those of us who are involved in the caregiving field \na seat at the table to decide how to best manage the funds provided to the \nState for both clients and caregivers. It seems the State would rather pay for a \nhospital stay or put a client in a nursing home instead of paying a decent wage \nto a caregiver to provide care in the client’s home. Many clients need more \nhours  to  be  taken  care  of  properly.  Clients  and  caregivers  need  personal \nprotective equipment provided to them at no cost to protect them. \n \nAs a caregiver, I can tell you that every client is different and broad sweeping \nrules about who gets what does not work. To be considered a front-line worker, \ncaregivers need personal protective equipment, and training and education that \nis not at their own expense. There are those who burn out quickly because the \npay is too low and half the workforce leaves the job within a year. When we \npay so little, do not provide proper training, equipment and sick time, we prove \nas a State we do not value and respect these workers. People who are caring \nfor others’ personal needs deserve to be paid better. \n \nNevada needs people who are involved in this work to be a part of the process \nin making decisions on how to spend the allocated funds for our State. Without \nthat, we have poorly run offices, underpaid workers, clients without enough \ncare and consideration; the list is long. We need to fix the broken system, give \nthe clients the hours they need for proper care and pay the workers a decent \nwage. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nIRMA NUNEZ: \nI support S.B. 340. I have been a home care worker for 12 years working for \n3 agencies and caring for 7 patients. I am a diabetic, have personal health care \nissues and need to be under a doctor’s care, which is costly. Five months ago, I \nhad a medical issue and went to the emergency room. The bill was expensive. I \nprovide care for others, but my job does not provide the benefit of caring for \nmyself. Home care workers work all day and night to ensure the health of their \nclients. We would like our health taken care of as well. During the Covid-19 \npandemic, we risked our lives to do our jobs. Senate Bill 340 will create the \nBoard that will investigate whether home care providers have access to quality, \naffordable health care. \n \nSHAWN SLATTER (Right at Home Care; Personal Care Association of Nevada): \nI own and operate Right at Home Care, Las Vegas, one of the larger personal \ncare agencies in Las Vegas, and oppose S.B. 340. I have been the provider and \nemployer of choice for the last five consecutive years. Should the Committee \nnot be aware, our industry is already regulated by the DHHS under regulation in \nthe Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 449 that depicts and calls regulation into \nwhat we are supposed to be training and not training for. \n \nMany of the speakers in support of S.B. 340 have spoken of various trainings \nand things they have paid for. In Nevada, it is illegal for any agency to require \nanyone to pay for their own training. Every agency is required to provide said \ntraining. Fingerprinting, health backgrounds, physician statements, and two-part \ntuberculosis tests are State-mandated by the Legislature that these employees \nmust have in order to perform work in this industry. We do not have the budget \nto  pay  for  these  items.  We  are  all  in  favor  of  increasing  wages  which \noften times is depicted by what Medicaid reimbursement rates are. Again, those \nare set by the Legislators. We understand there are bad apples in the industry. \nWe have been working as an association with DHHS, as well as the Office of \nLabor Commissioner, to get those agencies to act accordingly and follow the \nlabor laws. As an owner/operator, the leading provider and employer of choice, \nwe do everything we can to take care of our personal care attendants. \n \nThere  is  also  a  letter  of  opposition  provided  by  Advanced  Personal  Care \nSolutions (Exhibit L). \n \nCONNIE MCMULLEN (Personal Care Association of Nevada): \nI have submitted written testimony in opposition to S.B. 340 (Exhibit M). \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nBETH HANDLER, M.P.H. (Deputy Director, Programs, Department of Health and \nHumans Services): \nThe DHHS acknowledges the intent of S.B. 340 to assure equity, living wage \nand advance rights for home care providers. The Covid-19 pandemic magnified \nthe  need  for  home  care  employment  standards  and  addressing  inequities. \nFive states have existing statutes under their labor code enabling the creation of \nworkforce boards, also referred to as wage boards. Portions of the authority of \nlabor and wage standards in this bill would be new to DHHS authority, and a \nfiscal note will be required to create this type of infrastructure. \n \nSENATOR NEAL: \nThis bill is about creating an industry standard so there is a place and a voice for \nthe issues to be heard. Right now, there is no voice; there is no place outside of \nthe employer. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 340 and open the hearing on S.B. 309. \n \nSENATE BILL 309: Establishes a reinvestment advisory committee in certain \nlarger counties. (BDR 38-956) \n \nSENATOR DINA NEAL (Senatorial District No. 4): \nSenate Bill 309 has a unique origin. Assembly Bill No. 73 of the 80th Session \nwas  a  bill  that  came  from  the  City  of  Las  Vegas  which  mandated  local \ngovernments come together to find solutions for homelessness, and as a result \nwe have S.B. 309. \n \nJOANNA JACOB: (Clark County): \nThe working group for A.B. No. 73 of the 80th Session met approximately \n12 times  during  the  biennium,  and  we  came  up  with  recommendations  to \naddress homelessness. We also identified our needs, funding gaps and solutions \nwe can use as a road and policy map going forward. Some items, such as \nfunding which is a crucial component in Nevada, will have to wait in order to \nunderstand the challenges the Covid-19 pandemic posed on distinct local and \ngovernment budgets. \n \nThe working group identified our system capacity to address homelessness as \npart  of  our  efforts.  We  have  worked  on  a  regional  basis  to  address \nhomelessness. By the local government participating in that group, we have \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \ncollectively  spent  $55  million  committed  community-wide  to  address \nhomelessness across our service continuum. One of the things we identified as \nthe single largest barrier to the expansion of affordable housing and services in \nour region was funding. In housing alone in one year, $46 million to $55 million \nwould be needed to address homelessness if we were to house our homeless \npopulation. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, we are seeing an increase in \nnewly homeless individuals and families. \n \nThe  working  group  took  steps  to  address  homelessness  and  broke  it  into \nsix areas. One area that is working well is the regional oversight framework \nSenator  Dina  Neal  put  forward  in  A.B.  No. 73  of  the  80th  Session.  One \ngovernment working alone cannot address this on their own. We know we have \nsignificant  needs  in  housing,  behavioral  health,  services  and  intensive  case \nmanagement, coordination of data, prevention and intervention, and affordable \nhousing and development incentives which make up the remaining categories. \n \nThe Senate Bill 309 working group built off one of those strategies, which is the \nregional  oversight  idea.  Each  member  of  the  working  group  made  joint \nrecommendations, specifically taking advantage to leverage public and private \npartnerships to help us find solutions at the local and state government levels. \n \nExamples of where this has worked and is underway in southern Nevada speak \nto what we are proposing in S.B. 309. We have managed care vendors who \nserve people mostly at risk for housing and need support. They often partner \nwith local government to help with funding. In Arizona, as part of a community \nreinvestment  initiative  proposed  in  this  Committee,  one  managed  care \norganization (MCO) partnered with a local nonprofit to provide funding for a \n500 unit supportive housing unit. They partnered with the local government to \nhelp build it and mix the funding. The MCO will provide case management and \nhousing support for the people enrolled in their programs. \n \nWe have a program like that in southern Nevada. It started with a partnership \nbetween Clark County and Health Plan of Nevada and has since extended to all \nthree MCOs called Hospital to Home, a rapid rehousing program for medically \nfragile  and  literally  homeless  households.  We  use  our  U.S.  Department  of \nHousing and Urban Development funding at the county level and partner with \nthe MCOs to provide case management for their members in partnership with \nthe nonprofit, Help of Southern Nevada. It has been successful, and to date, we \nhave served 139 members through this program. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nWe looked at some of the things that are working in a way to continue this \ncollaboration. The State has been researching ways to address how to maximize \nMedicaid solutions to reduce the rate of the uninsured and tackle some of the \nsocial determinates of health that act as barriers to accessing health care. Also \nfinding  ways  to  maximize  community  reinvestment  dollars  was  a \nrecommendation made to the State in a report done by Princeton University \npublished in 2000. \n \nSenate Bill 309 will allow a forum for collaboration between the State, counties, \nlocal governments, nonprofits and the managed care vendors selected in the \nforthcoming request for proposal (RFP), to identify opportunities and gaps we \nhave in our existing service delivery continuum. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWill it be a requirement that managed care organizations make an investment \nback into the community? \n \nCODY L. PHINNEY M.P.H. (Deputy  Administrator,  Division  of  Health  Care \nFinancing and Policy, Department of Health and Human Services): \nOur managed care RFP published on March 17, requires in the scope of work \nany vendors participating in our contract start January 2022 and participate in \nthe  community  reinvestment  fund  as  a  portion  of  their  pre-tax  profits.  This \nwould be distributed by a plan the vendors would develop, and the State would \napprove. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWhat portion of their pre-tax profits? \n \nMS. PHINNEY: \nThe current scope of work is 3 percent of their pre-tax profits. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThis would be Nevada-based? \n \nMS. PHINNEY: \nFor this program, yes. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nAre  there  other  industries  that  participate  in  this  fund?  Managed  care \norganizations are not the root cause of homelessness. We have contracts with \nother types of vendors such as hospitals and physicians; why MCOs? \n \nMS. PHINNEY: \nThis  is  a  program  that  has  been  implemented  in  other  states,  and  the \nmechanism  is  allowable  under  the  managed  care  guidelines  from  the  CMS. \nOther types of vendors you mentioned would not fall into those managed care \nguidelines. That is the Medicaid aspect. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nActuarially set, the per-member, per-month numbers are done absent of this \ncalculation.  Does  this  increase  show  how  much  we  pay  on  a  per-member, \nper-month level for states? \n \nMS. PHINNEY: \nAre you asking if this impacts the capitation rate? \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nYes. \n \nMS. PHINNEY: \nIt  is  my  understanding  that  it  could.  We  are  in  the  process  of  setting  the \ncapitation  rates  for  2022.  I  can  confirm  this  with  other  states  that  have \nimplemented such a plan. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nWhy just Clark County if we are doing a Statewide bid on MCOs? Would the \nsame structure apply to Washoe and rural Counties? \n \nSENATOR NEAL: \nSenate Bill 309 had focused on the south, including Mesquite and Boulder City. \nBecause A.B. No. 73 of the 80th Session was brought by the south, there was \na conversation that Washoe County does not have an interest in being a part of \nthis structure; it was not a direct exclusion. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \nMS. JACOB: \nThe recommendation and the genesis for the working group committee came \nout of conversations among the regions in the south. We felt since we are \nfacing such a tremendous need in southern Nevada, not to belabor the point, \nthis report shows we have a significant gap. We felt we needed more people at \nthe  table  to  help  address  the  gap.  The  bill  is  written  permissively.  In  the \namendment  we  worked  on  giving  the  Director  of  DHHS  more  discretion  to \nappoint non-voting members that could build upon the Committee. \n \nMS. PHINNEY: \nOur RFP will be for Washoe and Clark Counties. It is possible it could expand, \nbut it does not address the rural counties at this time. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will need someone from Washoe County to follow up with me on this to \nunderstand why they would not want funding for services. \n \nIt was stated the bill was written permissively. Would the bill as written allow \nfor a similar structure set up in Washoe County? \n \nMS. JACOB: \nThe language could be easily modified if needed; maybe permissive was not the \ncorrect term. There is some room for changes.  \n \nI  do  not  represent  Washoe  County  and  cannot  speak  for  them.  I  will  have \nsomeone follow up on your funding question. \n \nKEVIN SCHILLER (Clark County): \nI agree with what Ms. Jacob stated. We had a meeting yesterday about the \nimplications of addiction, behavioral health, medical access and all of the pieces \nsignificant  in  terms  of  making  the  dollar  go  farther.  When  you  look  at  the \nAffordable Care Act (ACA) and the things that have changed, it is an alignment \nissue that from the days of County funding, social service and medical access. \nThere  are  diverse  community  barriers  to  the  medical  front  door.  These \npartnerships exist and continue to evolve. We want to ensure we are aligning \nour service array with the ACA’s array, create increased access and efficiency \nof  funding.  It  is  about  making  the  dollar  go  farther  where  we  have  the \nopportunity. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \nIf a client is in the hospital, they are paying ten times what they would pay for a \nprovision of services we are providing in a program such as the Hospital to \nHome program, which is a win for the MCOs. For reinvestment purposes, we \nwant  to  make  sure  that  when  the  MCOs  reinvest,  we  can  align  with  their \nbenefit in terms of what works for us. \n \nIn a crisis where  we have a  lot of one-shot funding coming,  we are in an \nopportunistic time. At the ground level, we are where we must be in order to \ncreate that front door and access point with our large partners. The State is our \nlargest partner, and we have mastered that. This is the wave of the future in \nterms of how we increase services levels. \n \nOn the managed care side, they have contracts and are accountable to those \ncontracts, and our clients are their clients. This is the other piece in terms of \nwhere the gaps are and how the county funds a gap. Where we put our dollars \nto fund a gap is not necessarily covered in an MCO plan, but can create a \nservice  array  for  that  hard  to  reach  addicted  client  that  may  be  in  west \nLas Vegas or in a rural area. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThere are specific services that MCOs provide that qualify toward meeting a \ncertain threshold, and the MCO’s are required to provide a report. They get to \ndictate how they spend their money. If the effort is to try to direct how they \nspend their money why are they not on the advisory committee? Do MCOs \nrequire a contract for community reinvestment? \n \nMS. PHINNEY: \nThey do not. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nDoes the contract lay out the specific categories that qualify towards meeting \nthat threshold?  \n \nMS. PHINNEY: \nThere are particular items in the current RFP that are specific. The vendors are \nrequired to provide a State-approved plan. If they provide a plan that does not \nadequately  meet  the  advice  of  this  Committee,  we  would  be  asking  for  a \nredrafted plan. This is a process we go through with the MCOs on a regular \nbasis. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 27 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWhat is the estimated dollar figure you expect to be contributed through the \ncommunity reinvestment piece of the contract? \n \nMS. PHINNEY: \nI do not have that figure, but I will get it for the Committee. \n \nMS. JACOB: \nThe intent is not to dictate that an MCO sit on an opportunity; that is why we \nwrote it as recommendations. We wrote it two ways. The bill states the local \ngovernments  will  be  reporting  to  the  MCOs  because  they  have  a  plan \nrequirement  to  deliver  to  the  State.  The  reports  that  will  be  required  are \nimportant for transparency for both the counties and the MCOs. You will see \nwhere  we  might  be  able  to  create  these  partnerships  and  know  what  is \nhappening  in  the  collaborations  between  the  State,  local  government  and \nmanaged care. This is why, in the proposed amendment (Exhibit N) we have the \nreporting going to both the Director of the DHHS and the Legislature through \nthe annual report. \n \nJARED LUKE (City of Las Vegas): \nThe  City  of  Las  Vegas  supports  S.B. 309.  We  appreciate  collaborating  and \nproviding input to this group and look forward to developing creative measures \nto help those in need. \n \nKELLY CROMPTON (City of Las Vegas): \nThe City of Las Vegas supports S.B. 309. I echo the remarks from our municipal \ncolleague from Clark County. \n \nDAVID CHERRY (City of Henderson): \nThe City of Henderson supports S.B. 309. The City of Henderson was an active \nparticipant in the A.B. No. 73 of the 80th Session working group which sought \nto  create  a  regional  focus  on  the  issue  of  homelessness.  The  Committee \nenvisioned S.B. 309 would present another opportunity to continue this focus \nand address other issues related to reinvesting funds in our community. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 309 and open the hearing on S.B. 305. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 28 \n \nSENATE  BILL  305:  Makes  various  changes  relating  to  access  to  organ \ntransplants for persons with disabilities. (BDR 40-40) \n \nSENATOR SCOTT HAMMOND: (Senatorial District No. 18): \nSenate Bill 305 prohibits certain providers of medical or related services from \ntaking  certain  actions  related  to  organ  transplant  solely  on  the  basis  of  a \nperson’s disability. \n \nIt authorizes a person aggrieved by the failure of such providers to comply with \ncertain requirements to institute a civil action for injunctive or other appropriate \nrelief. \n \nIt prohibits an insurer from taking certain actions related to an organ transplant \nbecause the insured is a person with a disability. It prevents a provider of health \ncare services from not placing a person with a disability on a transplant list, or \nplacing a patient low on the transplant list because of their disability. \n \nSenate Bill 305 does not take away a physician’s ability to diagnose a patient \nand determine whether or not the patient is eligible or a good fit for a particular \norgan transplant. \n \nWe are attempting to ensure people with disabilities, whether intellectual or \ncognitive, are not denied an organ transplant because of their disability. \n \nRACHAEL CHESIN (Caleb’s Law): \nCaleb’s Law supports S.B. 305. Caleb’s Law is an Act relating to health care \nand  the  organ  transplant  services  for  people  with  dishabilles  described  by \nSenator Hammond.  My  presentation  (Exhibit  O)  will  provide  information  on \nCaleb’s Law. \n \nI was born and raised in Las Vegas, and I am the Community Engagement \nDirector  of  the  nonprofit,  The  Just  One  Project.  My  son  Caleb  is  a  happy, \nhealthy 22-month-old, and has Trisomy 21, Down syndrome, which means he \nhas an extra copy of the 21st chromosome. \n \nI recently heard a story about a little girl, not yet a year old, living with her \nfamily in Ohio and in need of a heart transplant. Her parents were told she was \nnot eligible for a heart transplant, not because of her illness, but because she \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 29 \n \nhad Down syndrome. The doctors determined that since she had an intellectual \ndisability, her life was not worth saving because of an extra chromosome. \n \nWhen I heard this story, I believed it had to be an anomaly, some type of \ndoctors acting outside of standards of care. I heard many stories of others being \ndenied organ transplants due to their disabilities. A young boy with autism, a \nsmall  girl  denied  a  kidney,  a  5-month-old  boy  denied  a  heart  due  to  a \nchromosomal disorder similar to Down syndrome. \n \nI realized that if my son Caleb, who is healthy with no medical concerns to \nspeak  of  other  than  being  born  prematurely,  needed  an  organ  tomorrow,  it \nwould be because of an accident or trauma. It would have nothing to do with \nhis diagnosis of Down syndrome. Yet, studies show 85 percent of pediatric \ntransplant  centers  would  take  Caleb’s  intellectual  disability  into  account. \nInformation shows 71 percent of heart programs indicate even mild or moderate \ncognitive impairment is enough to disqualify him from the organ transplant list. \nTransplant centers usually consider intellectual diagnosis’s when deciding the \neligibility  of  transplantation.  Fifty-two  percent  of  people  with  intellectual \ndiagnosis receive a referral for a specialist evaluation, and 33 percent of those \n52 percent referred are never evaluated. \n \nIn February 2019, the University of North Carolina (UNC) was forced to resolve \nan investigation by the United States Department of Health and Human Services \nafter denying someone a heart transplant because of a learning disability. When \ntheir actions were challenged, UNC immediately reversed course with the United \nStates Department of Health and Human Services issuing this statement from \nDirector Roger Severino of the Office of Civil Rights; “Every life is precious and \nno  one  should  be  blocked  from  access  to  an  organ  transplant  because  of \nstereotypes about persons with disabilities. It is also against the law”. \n \nThis is an important point and the reason I am here today to support the ban of \norgan transplant discrimination in Nevada. We are not asking the State to do \nanything new or to reinvent the wheel. Discrimination in medical services is \nalready  illegal  under  the  federal  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  (ADA).  The \nproblem  is  enforcement.  There  is  no  way  for  you  or  I  to  enforce  the  ADA \nbecause it has no mechanism for enforcement. That leaves the State on our \nown to not just prove that discrimination but to give people an effective way to \nchallenge discrimination when and where it happens. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 30 \n \nThis is where Caleb’s Law comes in. Caleb’s Law clarifies doctors, hospitals, \ntransplant centers and other health care providers are prohibited from denying \naccess  to  necessary  organ  transplants  solely  on  the  basis  of  a  qualified \nindividual’s disability. It requires health care providers who are evaluating the \nlikelihood of transplant success consider the full range of support available to \nhelp a person with a disability manage their post-operative care. It also includes \na  fast-track  procedure  for  challenging  discrimination  and  ensures  people  in \nurgent need of an organ transplant can obtain timely resolutions to their claim. \n \nI have reached out to doctors across the State who head up multiple transplant \ncenters  throughout  the  Country.  I  also  contacted  the  American  Heart \nAssociation, the Children’s Heart Center Nevada and Opportunity Village and \nhave not heard one word of opposition to this bill. The response seems to be \none of understanding. Senate Bill 305 represents a significant step forward in \nthe protection of people with disabilities in Nevada. \n \nFifteen States have passed laws similar to this and another 13 have similar bills \npending in 2021. In almost every instance, those bills were proposed because \nsomeone  with  a  disability  was  in  a  desperate  and  immediate  need  of  a \nlife-saving transplant and was facing unfair discrimination. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nAre people with disabilities able to donate an organ? \n \nMS. CHESIN: \nThis bill is specific to those needing an organ transplant. \n \nDAN MUSGROVE (Nevada Donor Network): \nA person with a disability can donate an organ. Typically, the caregiver of the \nperson with a disability can authorize someone who is disabled to give the gift \nof life through organ donation. \n \nNevada Donor Network supports S.B. 305. Based on the population size we \nserve,  the  Nevada  Donor  Network  has  the  distinction  of  being  the  most \nproductive and successful organ procurement organization in the world. This is \nprimarily because of how inclusive we are as an organization. Sadly, 20 people \ndie each day in the United States waiting for the gift of life which never comes \nbecause of the shortage of organs available for transplantation. Among those \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 31 \n \nwho parish every day, are the most vulnerable citizens who must be assured an \nequal chance at life and health, regardless of what disability they may have. \n \nBRITTNEY PERKINS: \nI support S.B. 305. I am a resident of Henderson, Nevada. I am an attorney, and \nthe proud mother of a disabled daughter who at 4 months old had open heart \nsurgery to repair a hole in her heart. She has the additional 21st chromosome \nwhich led to her mild cognitive delay or perpetual happiness. Because of her \ngenetic make-up, if her heart repair had been unsuccessful, she could have been \ndenied a heart transplant due to this genetic condition that has no bearing on \nthe functionality of that transplant. \n \nNo parent should have to sit through that situation while their child is having \nsurgery and financially shoulder the burden that should the procedure not be \neffective and their child require an organ transplant, they might not get one \nbecause their child wears the title of disabled. These individuals are somehow \ndeemed less worthy of these life-saving measures. Times have changed and \nsociety  has  evolved.  My  daughter  is  entitled  to  the  benefits  of  the  equal \nprotection clause and enforcement of the ADA. \n \nThere is no place left in this State for organ transplant discrimination. We often \nthink a law is just a law until your child’s life depends on it, and it takes on a \nnew meaning. My child’s life is worth living and saving. \n \nCANDACE WONG: \nI support S.B. 305. I am a registered nurse and have a five-year-old daughter \nwho was born with Trisomy 21, Down syndrome. She communicates with her \npeers through an all-inclusive program, loves to rock climb, ride her bike and \nscooter and is active in every activity we partake in as a family. She is also \nactive in the community, cleaning up trails at Mt. Charleston, Red Rock and in \nthe Henderson area. Along with her twin sister and a friend of the family, we \ncollect  food  and  donations  for  Three  Square  and  do  walks  throughout  the \ncommunity to help multiple organizations in the area raise awareness. \n \nAt five years of age, she has made an impact along with her fellow peers at \nschool and in the community. She is entitled to the same benefits as her twin \nsister who does not have Trisomy 21. Both of them were born premature at \n29 weeks  and  weighed  less  than  3  pounds.  My  daughter  was  born  with \nduodenal atresia, had surgery, and a 5 percent chance of survival through the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 32 \n \nneonatal  intensive  care  unit.  She  is  here  today,  surviving  and  leading  all \nPre-K standards just like her peers. \n \nEvery individual has different medical concerns and conditions, but each one \nshould be evaluated prior to denying or accessing transplantation. A person with \na disability such as Down syndrome can and has donated an organ as long as \npermission is given. They also vote and work. We have resources available to \nassist people with disabilities to be a part of the community. This is not a time \nwhen people with disabilities are forgotten or institutionalized. They are here \nand will continue to be a part of our community. \n \nDUANE  YOUNG  (Deputy  Administrator,  Division  of  Health  Care  Financing  and \nPolicy, Department of Health and Human Services): \nThe Division of Health Care Financing and Policy is neutral to S.B. 305 and \nbelieves this is good public health policy; however, the Division does request a \nfriendly amendment. The language states the provisions in S.B. 305 must go \ninto the State plan. This is our contract with CMS, and this language would be \nbest  in  our  Medicaid  Services  Manual  holding  all  providers  and  partners  of \nMedicaid accountable to the language in the bill. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe  Committee’s  legal  counsel  has  provided  an  answer  to  the  question  of \npeople with disabilities donating an organ. Based on NRS 451.556, people with \na disability can donate under the same circumstances as anyone else. \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nI am amenable to the amendment proposed by Mr. Young. It fits in with what \nwe are trying to accomplish; we want to ensure it is in the right place. \n \nMy legislative assistant provided me with an article from January 2020 quoting: \n \n“Every second counts when a sick child needs an organ transplant.  \nBut parents of people with disabilities may need years to get their \nchildren on the list. \n \nPeople with disabilities can be organ donors. They can give all their \norgans; there’s no law against it. But if someone with a disability \nneeds an organ transplant, that fact alone can get them removed \nfrom the list.” \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 33 \n \nIn a time when we are trying to equal things out, S.B. 305 seeks to do just that, \nbringing equality to the disabled community. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 305 and open the hearing on S.B. 329. \n \nSENATE  BILL  329:  Revises  provisions  relating  to  competition  in  health  care \nmarkets. (BDR 40-998) \n \nSENATOR ROBERTA LANGE (Senatorial District No. 7): \nI will read from my written remarks (Exhibit P) as I present S.B. 329 and discuss \nthe conceptual amendment (Exhibit Q). \n \nSTACIE SASSO (Executive Director, Health Services Coalition): \nThe  Health  Services  Coalition  represents  25  employer  and  union-sponsored \nhealth plans in southern Nevada, including MGM, Boyd Gaming, firefighters, \npolice  and  numerous  self-funded  union  plans,  including  culinary,  electrical \nworkers, plumbers and various other groups. The Coalition’s main focus is to \nbring affordable quality health care to our estimated 300,000 clients in southern \nNevada. \n \nBOBBETTE BOND (Director of Public Policy, Culinary Health Fund): \nWe  are  a  nonprofit  fund  that  provides  comprehensive  benefits  to \n125,000 people in Las Vegas. We have two pharmacies and a large primary \ncare  center  that  had  40,000  visits  the  year  before  the  Covid-19  pandemic \nstarted.  We  are  a  piece  of  the  healthcare  market,  and  our  focus  is  on \nhigh-quality affordable health care and how to get there. We are aggressive \nabout trying to be effective stewards of both private and public money for \nNevada. \n \nAs Senator Lange outlined, there is an increasing consolidation in the healthcare \nindustry, healthcare hospital systems buying other system and private equity \nbuying up doctor groups. Experts expect that trend to continue with Covid-19 \nbecause  of  its  impact  on  the  healthcare  industry.  I  have  a  presentation \n(Exhibit R) outlining some of these impacts. \n \nWe know consolidation is happening in Nevada, and our markets are already \nimpacted. We do not yet have any line of sight into the impact of consolidation \nand its impact in Nevada. Price is a primary factor behind the United States high \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 34 \n \nhealth  care  costs  compared  to  other  nations,  and  consolidation  and  lack  of \ncompetition is a critical factor in health care prices. \n \nPrices in health care have increased must faster than inflation. Hospital prices in \nthe United States have increased at a staggering pace over the last 20 years \noutstripping college tuition, wages and housing. According to CMS, hospital \nprices rose three times the rate of inflation between 1960 and 2016. \n \nIf prices did the same thing in the food market, we would pay $57 for a crate of \noranges, $65 for a dozen eggs and $160 for a gallon of milk. \n \nThere are two kinds of industry consolidation. The first is horizontal. This is \nwhen one facility buys another like facility and are in the same place in the \nhealthcare  market.  That  is  often  a  hospital  to  hospital  merger.  Studies \nrepeatedly  show  this  kind  of  consolidation  results  in  higher  prices  without \nimproving quality, which is what we are interested in. Academically, researchers \nfound post-merger hospital prices increased 20 percent to 44 percent, and they \nwere  not  associated  with  improved  quality.  It  was  modestly  worse  patient \nquality and patient experience. \n \nThe second industry consolidation is vertical. This is when one industry higher \nin the health care chain purchases or absorbs one lower on the chain, and when \na large physician group purchases a specialty group. A recent study shows over \na 4-year period, a 32 percent to 47 percent increase in prices with no quality \nimprovement  occurs  when  hospitals  or  physician  groups  merge.  In  the  last \n5 years, there has been $10 billion worth of consolidation private equity money \nalone coming into the healthcare market buying medical practices. We know \nthis is happening and have personal experiences we see in contracts, but we do \nnot have any line of sight policywise to see the system in Nevada, and that is \nwhy S.B. 329 was brought forward. \n \nThe private equity playbook in most industries is to leverage the debit to buy the \ncompany,  cut  costs  and  sell  at  a  profit  within  three  to  five  years  at  an \nannualized rate of return between 20 percent and 30 percent. It is not like \nbuying  cars.  We  are  talking  about  people’s  health  and  lives,  and  when  it \nbecomes a monetary transaction, we are losing the things health care needs to \nhave. State and federal authority exists to prevent competition and unfair stock \npractices  that  hurt  competition,  but  health  care  deals  fall  below  the  radar, \nespecially in Nevada. It takes a high level of an integrated merger in order for us \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 35 \n \nto be aware of it. Increasingly, states are looking at other ways to get their \narms around understanding what is going on with competition and try to protect \nthe healthcare market to keep it healthy and competitive. \n \nMAYA HOLMES (Culinary Health Fund): \nSenate Bill 329 will ensure Nevada has accessible data on what is happening in \nour healthcare markets to protect health care competition. This information is \ncritical for the State, policymakers, patients, payers and other stakeholders in \norder to understand consolidation in our healthcare market and guide decisions \nthat  protect  competition  and  patient  choice.  It  will  also  ensure  we  address \nmarket players who are trying to use their market power to drive up prices and \nthwart competition based on price and quality. \n \nThis bill proposes prohibiting anticompetitive contracting practices hospitals and \nhealth care providers with market dominance can demand because payers have \nto have them in their markets. \n \nThere were recent settlements in two major anti-trust lawsuits; one in California \ninvolving  the  Sutter  Health  system  and  another  in  North  Carolina.  These \nsettlements ended many of the anticompetitive contracting practices. However, \nthe settlements did not set legal precedence, and they only apply to the health \nsystem involved in the lawsuits which were major multi-year lawsuits. \n \nAnticompetitive  contracting  practices  like  all-or-nothing,  anti-steering  and \nanti-tiering prevent health plans from directing or incentivizing patients toward \nlower-cost, higher-quality care. These provisions prevent other hospitals from \nbenefiting if they offer better deals or higher quality. They stop patients and \nhealth plans from shopping for and getting the best deal. \n \nWe  are  working  with  Senator  Lange  on  some  of  the  language  involving \nself-funded  plans,  but  that  work  will  not  change  the  substance  of  the \nconceptual  amendment,  Exhibit  Q,  and  how  we  are  proposing  it  will  affect \nS.B. 329. \n \nAs  a  result  of  the  conceptual  amendment,  Exhibit  Q,  the  bill  will  have \ntwo primary provisions. First, the bill will require reporting on health care deals \ninvolving hospitals and physician groups 60 days after they have occurred. It \nwould require basic summary information to be reported. That information is \nlisted in the bill. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 36 \n \nA portion of the bill requires DHHS to post the information contained in the \nnotices  on  an  internet  website  maintained  by  DHHS  which  is  important  for \ntransparency. Connecticut has done this for several years. The DHHS would \nalso prepare an annual report with the summary information regarding market \ntransactions and concentration in health care based on those notices. \n \nSecond, the bill’s other major provision would make specific anticompetitive \ncontract provisions unfair trade practices, and those prohibited provisions would \nbe  void  and  severable.  The  specific  contract  provisions  between  hospitals, \nhealth systems, providers and health plans would be prohibited as an unfair \ntrade  practice  and  are  anti-tiering  and  anti-steering  clauses.  These  clauses \nessentially require health plans to place all health system hospitals in the most \nfavorable  tier  with  the  lowest  cost-sharing  regardless  of  the  rates  they  are \ncharging or their quality. \n \nThe  other  anticompetitive  provision  prohibited  would  be  all-or-nothing \ncontracting. Some health systems demand an insurer include all the systems \nfacilities in their network. This would be regardless of whether a plan needs the \nfacilities for their members if it drives up health care costs or is a lower-quality \nfacility. \n \nKATHERINE GUDIKSEN (Senior Health Policy Researcher, The Source on Healthcare \nPrice and Competition): \nThere  are  seven  other  states  considering  similar  bills  this  Session  to  ban \nparticular contract terms, anti-sharing, anti-steering or all-or-nothing contracting \nas shown in my presentation (Exhibit S). This creates unfair trade practices and \nthese seven states ban them in those contracts. The federal government also \nconsidered  similar  language  last  Session,  but  it  did  not  make  it  through \nCongress at the end of the Session. The Lower Health Care Costs Act of 2019 \nwould have banned these provisions for all plans. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nNarrow  networks  seem  to  be  anticompetitive.  A  physician  cannot  enter  a \ncontract that has certain provisions that restrain the ability of an insured to \ncontract with other providers of health care. Is this going to create more of a \nnarrow network but not allow a narrow network to happen? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 37 \n \nMS. GUDIKSEN: \nSenate Bill 329 would allow insurers to develop narrow networks so this would \nbe another option. Many of the large health systems require their inclusion in a \nnetwork, so it is hard for insurers to steer patients toward higher value, higher \nquality care. This bill would prevent that. It does not prevent insurers from \ncreating narrow networks or physicians from entering narrow networks. \n \nMS. BOND: \nIt also does not encourage them. It is not about narrow networks. What we are \ntrying  to  do  is  make  sure  patients  have  the  ability  to  use  their  copays, \ndeductibles and their part of the health care costs to go to the facility that has \nthe best quality. It is the opposite of what you are suggesting. We have large \nnetworks and want to keep all the current doctors and hospitals under contract. \nPatients  need  to  have  the  ability  with  their  own  dollars  to  go  within  that \nnetwork to the place they can receive the best quality and not be prohibited by \na contract to do that. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nIn Nevada, the Attorney General has plenary powers to pursue deceptive and \nunfair  practices.  Can  you  explain  why  those  powers  are  not  sufficient  to \naddress this type of anticompetitive behavior? \n \nMS. BOND:  \nThere is another bill this Session to try to deal with some of this, but what we \nhave  heard  from  the  Office  of  the  Attorney  General  is  they  are  not  in  the \nbusiness of making any of this information public. For public policy reasons and \nto understand the ecosystem and the market, we need it to be public. They only \nhandle issues at a high dollar threshold, similar to United Healthcare merging \nwith Sierra Health Services which received a lot of action a decade ago from the \nOffice of the Attorney General. Where you have one hospital buying another \nhospital or private equity in the market buying in small chunks, the Office of the \nAttorney General is not involved. \n \nMS. HOLMES: \nThe other piece is that some of the contracts are opaque so people do not know \nthey are confidential or what is contained in those contracts. This bill is making \nit explicitly clear that these are prohibited transactions under the Unfair Trade \nPractices Act. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 38 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIn the conceptual amendment, Exhibit Q, section 7, paragraph iii, what does it \nmean to place all members of a health care provider in the same tier of a tiered \nnetwork plan? \n \nMS. GUDIKSEN: \nWhen  insurers  want  to  use  tiered  networks,  they  often  divide  a  range  of \nproviders into different tiers with different cost-sharing; for example, the highest \nvalue or quality. They put the highest quality providers in one tier with the \nlowest cost-sharing so there would be some incentive for patients to choose \nthem. Some large health systems with a hospital, Magnetic resonance imaging \n(MRI) clinic and a lab contractually require all of these services to be placed on \nthe highest value tier even if they would not meet the quality or cost standards \non their own. This would allow an insurer to divide providers based on quality to \nthe different tiers or whatever standards they have for placing providers in tiers. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWould providers place multiple or different doctors within the same practice in \ndifferent tiers? \n \nMS. GUDIKSEN: \nTypically they would not. The one state that has this in law is Massachusetts, \nand  they  clearly  have  restrictions  on  how  the  tiers  are  divided  which  are \ntypically by facility. For example, a group practice would be in one tier, but the \nhospital itself would be in another. The MRI and out-patient clinics might be in a \nseparate tier. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWe have a for-profit healthcare system. The group practices and hospitals have \nbusiness  negotiations  and  contracts  that  take  place  between  two  private \nentities. For a provider to ask to be put into a specific tier would be a deceptive \ntrade practice. Is that where we want to go? \n \nMS. BOND: \nWe do not want to prevent our members from being able to have health care \nmove towards high quality and high value because a contract is required and \nbecause the provider has the monopoly level control over the market. There is a \nrequirement to serve the members you are contracted with but not let that be \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 39 \n \nprohibitive from having incentives where they are able to use other providers. \nThere are contracts that do not allow this. \n \nMS. HOLMES: \nMarket  players  are  using  their  market  dominance,  which  is  their  monopoly \npayer, preventing other providers and facilities from being able to compete on \nthe basis of price and quality. The dominant provider is saying they can be in \nthe same tier even though they charge more and have lower quality. They base \nthat on the fact that they are so large they have to be in that network and can \ndemand that. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nDoes section 8 of the bill void the currently existing contract? \n \nMS. BOND: \nNot  the  contract,  just  that  section  of  the  contract  that  is  the  monopoly \nlanguage. The rest of the contract stands. \n \nRUSTY MCALLISTER  (Nevada  State  American  Federation  of  Labor  Congress  of \nIndustrial Organization): \nThe  Nevada  State  American  Federation  of  Labor  Congress  of  Industrial \nOrganization supports S.B. 329. We believe the recording notifications regarding \nbuy-outs and mergers are essential to our members’ health plans. There have \nbeen many changes in the last five years. Mergers and buy-outs are becoming \nmore of a regular practice, and private equity has found this is a great market to \njump into. There are two emergency room groups in southern Nevada that are \nnow owned by private equity groups. One of these groups tried to terminate the \ncontract, or run out a contract of emergency rooms, simply so they could raise \nthe rates. These notifications will help us to better advise our members, and \ncontrol the cost of the limited amount of dollars we have. \n \nWe are supportive of the language that keeps providers of health care from \nhaving contracts that limit our members and plans from seeking out the best \nand most cost effective treatments that are important to them. The language in \nthese contracts creates a monopoly scenario, and that is not good use of our \nlimited health care dollars. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 40 \n \nJUSTON LARSEN: \nI am a Culinary Union member and have had asthma most of my life. I want to \nbe  an  informed  and  empowered  patient  and  need  the  information  to  better \nadvocate for myself. I trust my culinary health fund to ensure I am going to get \nthe best quality of care at the lowest price. I would like my culinary health fund \nadvocate to provide advice on where it would be best for me to go that is safe, \nwith a good medical professional and clinic that has the lowest co-pay amount. \nRight now, due to anti-steering and anti-tiering language in hospital contracts, \nmy health fund is not able to give me the complete information I need and \ndeserve.  That  is  not  right.  Removing  anticompetitive  clauses  from  hospital \ncontracts will allow my health fund to provide the complete information I need \nto meet my health needs. \n \nJAMES SULLIVAN (Culinary Health Union): \nThe Culinary Health Union supports S.B. 329 because health care affordability, \nquality  and  access  are  critical  concerns  for  culinary  union  members. \nConsolidation in the healthcare industry drives up prices but not the quality of \nour health care. Senate Bill 329 will take important steps to help understand \nhow consolidation impacts our healthcare markets. It will stop anticompetitive \ncontracting practices that prevent patients, employers and plans from shopping \nfor and getting the best deals. \n \nJAMES WADHAMS (Nevada Hospital Association): \nThe  Nevada  Hospital  Association  opposes  S.B. 329.  The  Nevada  Hospital \nAssociation  members  have  not  had  a  chance  to  review  the  conceptual \namendment, Exhibit Q. Although we are in opposition, we have committed to \ncontinue to work with Senator Lange and any other stakeholders on this bill. \n \nGEORGE ROSS (HCA Healthcare): \nAs  the  bill  is  drafted,  and  with  the  conceptual  amendment,  Exhibit  Q, \nHCA Healthcare  opposes  S.B. 329.  This  bill  would  necessitate  separate \ncontracts for each hospital, ambulatory surgery center and urgent care center. \nWe have carefully developed a system of care over many years with protocols \nand IT systems critical to organizing and coordinating care to get the right, most \neffective treatment for a person at the right time. \n \nThis bill, as written, with the amendment, Exhibit Q, would fragment care at the \nrisk of duplication of services, destruct relationships, end value-based contracts \nand most likely raise costs. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 41 \n \nHospitals under an HCA contract with physician groups, such as emergency \nroom groups, are not exclusive contracts. These physician groups are free to \ncontract with any group they choose. \n \nOne can argue the only limits on an individual patient shopping for the best deal \nand  doctors  are  the  terms  of  his  individual  insurance  plan,  his  or  her \nout-of-network penalties, coinsurance and copays. The limitation is the narrow \nnetworks, not the providers or the hospitals. \n \nKATIE RYAN (Dignity Health - St. Rose Dominican): \nDignity Health - St. Rose Dominican opposes the original version of S.B. 329 \nand  the  conceptual  amendment,  Exhibit  Q,  for  the  reasons  cited  by  my \ncolleagues. This bill is duplicative of A.B. 47 which we have been working on \nwith the Office of the Attorney General on reporting of health care transactions. \n \nAssembly  Bill  47:  Revises  provisions  relating  to  unfair  trade  practices. \n(BDR 52-425) \n \nAlso, the contracting restrictions piece of both the original version of the bill and \nthe conceptual amendment, Exhibit Q, is problematic. It will make navigating \nhealth care coverage more difficult for patients while creating access to care \nand quality issues by interrupting the continuity of care. \n \nCHRIS BOSSE (Renown Health): \nRenown  Health  opposes  S.B.  329  as  drafted  and  the  conceptual  language \nprovided which we have had for less than 24 hours and have not been able to \ndetermine all impacts of the bill. \n \nAs an integrated delivery system, Renown Health provides value to its patients \nand  those  employer  groups  and  payers  we  contract  with  by  being  able  to \nprovide high quality care in the most cost effective setting, including the past \nyear during the Covid-19 pandemic in the patient’s home when appropriate. \nExcluding components of the delivery system we offer diminishes our ability to \nmeet patient’s needs. By connecting the components of the healthcare delivery \nsystem, we are able to coordinate care, hold components of the delivery system \naccountable to outcomes and improve communication between the levels of \ncare and the patient. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 42 \n \nSenate Bill 329 undermines components that nationally CMS has encouraged \nhealthcare  delivery  systems  to  build  through  establishing  accountable  care \norganizations  which  have  demonstrated  the  ability  to  improve  quality  and \nprovide the most cost effective care. \n \nSection 8 of the bill and the most recent amended language voids elements of \nexisting  contracts  where  rates  have  been  established  based  on  the  entire \nframework of a current contract. This places a significant hardship on hospitals \nand healthcare delivery systems in Nevada who provide a discount based on a \npredicted number of patients. This will likely result in an unprecedented volume \nof contract renegotiations where prices will have to go up to sustain services in \nan environment of significant uncompensated costs related to government and \nuninsured cared provided. \n \nDAN MUSGROVE (Valley Health System): \nValley Health System opposes S.B. 329. I echo the comments of my colleagues \nfrom  HCA  as  well  as  Renown.  The  Valley  Health  System  is  eight  hospitals \nStatewide,  soon  to  be  nine.  It  is  that  system  of  care  that  prevents \nfragmentation  and  delivers  better  care  at  a  better  cost  to  both  our  insured \npartners as well as our patients. \n \nMARGOT  CHAPPEL  (Deputy  Administrator,  Regulatory  and  Planning  Services, \nDivision  of  Public  and  Behavioral  Health,  Department  of  Health  and \nHuman Services): \nWe have reviewed the bill and there is some fiscal impact we wanted to report. \nWe will need to add staff because of the language in section 1 of the bill that \nidentifies  proposed  statute  language  where  offices  would  be  responsible  for \nsetting up the website, collecting the data and analyzing and reporting the data. \n \nJARON HILDEBRAND (Nevada State Medical Association): \nThe Nevada State Medical Association is in the neutral position on S.B. 329. \nFirst and foremost, we consider ourselves as a patient advocacy organization. \nWe received the amendment, Exhibit Q, late yesterday, and we are waiting on \nfeedback  from  our  membership.  Generally,  we  favor  transparency  and  fully \nshare the concerns of the bill sponsor regarding increasing the cost of health \ncare. Many of our practices have been crushed during the Covid-19 pandemic, \nand we know the residual effects from this have yet to be seen in our small \npractices across the State. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 43 \n \nWe have some concerns with the reporting sections at the beginning of the bill. \nMost transactions are not a concern, and it cannot be emphasized enough the \nAttorney General already has the ability to intervene when there is a reason for \nconcern. Increasing the thresholds for individual providers to a percentage of \nspecialty markets and specifying a material change, should trigger the recording \nand would reduce our concerns. Including small joint ventures and management \ncontracts, would be overwhelming and would not meet the intent of recordings. \n \nWe  are  still  reviewing  the  second  half  of  this  bill  and  are  working  to  fully \nunderstand  the  anti-steering  and  anti-tiering  provisions  that  will  affect  the \nmarket. We support competition in the market and believe patients should have \naccess to high-quality care. We do not want to take any contracting tools away \nfrom our small providers when negotiating with large corporations. \n \nSUSAN FISHER (Nevada State Society of Anesthesiologists): \nThe  Nevada  State  Society  of  Anesthesiologists  is  neutral  on  S.B. 329  with \nconcerns for the same reasons expressed by Mr. Hildebrand. We fail to see how \nthe bill will help with patient-physician relationships. We would like a better \nunderstanding of if the physician reports to one insurer what another insurer \npays them for similar services, how this will help the patient or the provider. We \nare  still  analyzing  the  conceptual  amendment,  Exhibit  Q,  and  how  this  bill \ninteracts with the Attorney General’s bill that is of a similar nature. \n \nJESSICA FERRATO (Association for Comprehensive Energy Psychology): \nThe  Association  for  Comprehensive  Energy  Psychology  (ACEP)  is  neutral  on \nS.B. 329. Health care transparency is a priority for ACEP. We are reviewing the \nchanges  from  the  conceptual  amendment,  Exhibit  Q,  and  look  forward  to \ncontinuing to work with the sponsors. \n \nLINDSAY KNOX (Nevada Orthopaedic Society): \nThe Nevada Orthopaedic Society is neutral on S.B. 329. We have not had time \nto review the conceptual amendment, Exhibit Q, and echo the comments made \nby Mr. Hildebrand and Ms. Fisher. \n \nTOM CLARK (Nevada Association of Health Plans): \nThe Nevada Association of Health Plans is the private insurance carrier that \nmakes  up  19  percent  of  the  market  in  Nevada,  and  we  are  in  the  neutral \nposition on S.B. 329. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 44 \n \nThe  work  we  have  done  with  the  sponsor  has  produced  the  conceptual \namendment, Exhibit Q, giving private carriers the comfort level that allows us to \nbe in the neutral position. \n \nSENATOR LANGE: \nThis bill is about consolidation and transparency. We will continue to work with \nthe stakeholder in an attempt to resolve the issues brought up today. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRemainder of page intentionally left blank, signature page to follow.   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 45 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 329.

(BDR 40-220) \n \nSENATOR DALLAS HARRIS (Senatorial District No. 11): \nIt  is  my  honor  to  present  S.B.  275.  With  me  today  is  former  State \nSenator David Parks,  Andre  Wade  from  Silver  State  Equality  and \nNathan Cisneros  from  the  Williams  Institute.  Senate  Bill  275  will  modernize \nNevada's laws on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by treating HIV as all \nother communicable diseases are treated. In doing so, Nevada will remove from \nstatute  all  discriminatory  laws  unfairly  targeting  people  because  of  their \nHIV status. These laws were not rooted in science but in fear and have had \nsignificant negative public health consequences for Nevada for decades. \n \nSenate Bill 275 is the culmination of many years of thoughtful discussion and \nhard work led by former Senator Dave Parks. I have asked him to join me to \nprovide  you  a  historical  overview  of  how  we  got  to  this  important  hearing \ntoday.  \n \nDAVID PARKS: \nAs a former Nevada Senator, I was successful in getting S.B. No. 284 of the \n80th Session passed, which created the Advisory Task Force on HIV Exposure \nModernization. A report (Exhibit B) the Task Force delivered to the Legislature \ncontained many recommendations now in S.B. 275 to examine statutes related \nto the criminalization of HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) \nand  make  recommendations  for  their  revision.  These  statutes  taken  under \nreview grew out of recommendations from an advisory task force created by \nformer Governor Richard Bryan 35 years ago in 1986. Over the 30 years the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \ntask force was in place, I was a member of that Task Force. During the early \nyears  of  the  HIV  infection  and  AIDS  epidemic,  states  including  Nevada \nimplemented HIV-specific criminal exposure laws. These laws imposed criminal \npenalties on people knowing their condition of living with HIV, who potentially \nexposed  others.  In  1990,  the  Ryan  White  Comprehensive  AIDS  Resources \nEmergency Act provided states with funding for HIV/AIDS treatment and care. It \nrequired every state receiving funds to certify its criminal laws were adequate to \nprosecute any HIV individual who knowingly exposed another person to HIV. In \nour legal system, criminalization of potential HIV exposure is largely a matter of \nstate law and not federal legislation. An analysis by the Centers for Disease \nControl  and  Prevention  (CDC)  and  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  found \n67 laws enacted in 33 states explicitly focused on persons living with HIV. The \nmajority  of  these  laws  were  passed  before  antiretroviral  therapies  were \ndeveloped  that  reduced  HIV  transmission  risk  to  zero.  It  is  possible  to  be \nHIV positive and have no detectable presence of the virus. \n \nAs a person who helped develop Nevada's HIV/AIDS statutes and regulations in \nthe late 1980s and early 1990s, this is an issue I have wrestled with the last \nfour Legislative Sessions. Over the years, we found that criminalization laws do \nnot support evidence-based public health practices reaching those who are at \nhigh risk for HIV and AIDS. Data indicated people who are at high risk for \nHIV exposure  are  deterred  from  testing  which  facilitates  HIV  care  and \nprevention  methods  that  will  stop  the  transmission  of  HIV.  They  are  being \ncharged with life-altering felony charges, prosecuted for living with HIV, not \ndisclosing their status and affecting both testing and care. \n \nWith the passage of S.B. No. 284 of the 80th Session, a coalition of social \nservice and healthcare professionals from across the State and Nation worked \ndiligently to address this issue and develop recommendations for consideration \nby the Legislature. The work accomplished by the Task Force was beyond my \nwildest  expectation.  It  is  long  past  time  for  Nevada  to  modernize  these \nHIV laws. \n \nANDRE WADE (Silver State Equality; Chair, Advisory Task Force on HIV Exposure \nModernization): \nI  am  State  Director  for  Silver  State  Equality,  a  Nevada-based  Statewide \nLGBTQ civil rights organization which brings the voices of LGBTQ people and \nallies  to  the  institutions  of  power  in  Nevada  and  across  the  United  States \nstriving  to  create  a  world  that  is  healthy,  just  and  fully  equal  for  all \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nLGBTQ+ people. I am also the Chair of the Nevada HIV Modernization Coalition \nand speak on behalf of both groups with our support statement (Exhibit C). For \ndecades, we have had laws (Exhibit D) which are ineffective and discriminatory. \nThey do more harm than good. Efforts are underway to end the HIV epidemic, \nin  part  by  developing  Statewide  and  local  plans  to  address  people  getting \ntested, seeking care and staying in care. These plans include modernizing laws \n(Exhibit E) that otherwise criminalize legal behavior or increase penalties for \ncriminal behavior based on a person's HIV status. These laws stigmatize people \nliving with HIV and go against public health efforts to end the HIV epidemic. \nThese laws have been put in place by specifically calling out HIV when other \nclinical diseases are not. \n \nThe issue is to simply treat HIV like any other clinical disease. I have submitted \na statement of support (Exhibit F). This effort is also supported by the CDC, the \nNational Institutes of Health, American Medical Association and the U.S. Office \nof Infectious Disease and HIV/Aids Policy. Human immunodeficiency virus is a \npublic health issue not a criminal one; our laws should reflect that. \n \nNATHAN CISNEROS (HIV Criminalization Analyst, Williams Institute, School of Law, \nUniversity of California, Los Angeles): \nThe Task Force asked us to analyze data on individuals who came into contact \nwith the Nevada criminal justice system through HIV-related crimes. We have \nconducted seminal analysis in other states, and I will present initial findings. We \ncounted 37 people who were arrested for HIV-related crimes in Nevada. We \ncounted  76  individual  HIV-related  charges  across  67  arrest  cycles.  This  is \nbroadly in line with the per capita rate we have seen in other states and is \ndozens more than we observe in either press reports or public court documents. \n \nAbout two-thirds of those individual arrest charges are for sex work-related \ncharges for solicitation or engaging in prostitution after a positive HIV test. The \nother  one-third  is  for  intentional  transmission  of  HIV,  either  intentional \ntransmission  attempted  or  conspiracy.  We  see  no  evidence  that  arrests  are \ndecreasing  over  time.  For  example,  we  observed  20  arrests  for  solicitation \ncharges before 2013. We saw 29 arrests for solicitation charges after 2013 in a \nrising trend for transmission or attempted transmission arrests. \n \nIndividuals  arrested  in  other  states  revealed  HIV  crimes  disproportionately \nimpact people of color. Over half of those arrested for HIV crimes in Nevada are \nBlack;  however,  Black  Nevadans  make  up  just  9  percent  of  the  State's \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \npopulation and 27 percent of Nevada's population of people living with HIV. \nSimilar  to  other  states,  HIV  crimes  disproportionately  impact  women. \nSixteen percent  of  people  living  with  HIV  in  Nevada  are  women.  Almost \none-third of those arrested for HIV crimes are women. \n \nRegarding outcomes, we saw that 30 percent of all charges resulted in a guilty \noutcome either at trial or the individual pled guilty. There is a racial imbalance in \nthese guilty outcomes. The overwhelming majority of those found guilty for sex \nwork-related crimes are Black. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nIn the conceptual amendment (Exhibit G), sections 1, 2 and 5 require orders \nissued by State and local health authorities requiring a person to undergo a \nmedical examination to verify the presence of a communicable disease or order \nisolation, quarantine or treatment. Due to the presence of exposure to such a \ndisease, to also state the reasons the action prescribed by the order are the \nleast  restrictive  course  necessary  to  prevent,  suppress  or  control  the \ncommunicable disease. \n \nSection  4  language  proposed  to  be  added  to  Nevada  Revised  Statutes \n(NRS) 441A.040 in the original bill was stricken by the conceptual amendment. \nSection 3 sets forth legislative findings that the spread of communicable disease \nis best addressed through public health measures, not criminalization. Section 6, \nsubsection 4 provides an exemption for creating an affirmative defense to a \ncharge under NRS 441A.180. Section 6 also states how to determine whether a \nperson acted intentionally. \n \nSection 24 repeals a provision of law making it a Category B felony for a person \nwho has tested positive for HIV to intentionally, knowingly or willfully engage in \nconduct in a manner intended to or likely to transmit the disease. It refers you \nback to section 6 where a person would instead be guilty of a misdemeanor. \nSection 7 revises conditions under which a court may order a person be tested \nfor communicable disease. Section 7 requires a court to determine whether it is \nnecessary to test the other person to determine the appropriate treatment for a \nfirst responder, county coroner or medical examiner. \n \nSection 11 deals with alleged victims or witnesses to a crime that alleged the \ncrime involved sexual penetration of the victim's body. The health authority \nmust  offer  to  test  the  person  for  sexually  transmitted  diseases.  Section 17 \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nrequires the Legislative Counsel to ensure people living with HIV are referred to \nin the Nevada Revised Statutes using language commonly viewed as respectful \nand sentence structure that refers to the person before referring to his or her \ndisorder. Section 18 provides the policy of the State is that such persons are \nreferred to in a similar manner in the Nevada Administrative Code (NAC). \n \nSections  8,  9,  11  through  14,  16  and  19  through  21  revise  terminology \nreferring to HIV, other communicable diseases and related issues. Section 24 \nrepeals laws that require a person arrested for prostitution or solicitation for \nprostitution and each offender in the custody of Department of Corrections be \ntested  for  HIV.  We  have  repealed  the  provision  of  law  which  makes  it  a \nCategory B felony to engage in prostitution after testing positive for HIV. We \nalso  repealed  the  section  that  requires  the  Director  of  the  Department  of \nCorrections to establish an educational program related to HIV for inmates and \nemployees of the Department. Sections 10 and 15 make conforming changes to \nremove  references  to  the  repealed  sections.  Section  22  reestablishes  the \nAdvisory Task Force on HIV Exposure Modernization for the 2021-2022 Interim \nSession which was originally created by S.B. No. 284 of the 80th Legislative \nSession. This bill is comprehensive and seeks to modernize our HIV laws across \nthe board. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIf a person knows he or she is HIV positive and has sex or shares a needle with \nsomeone, is that individual now guilty of a misdemeanor and not a felony? \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nIt would depend. The sharing of a needle is a consensual choice. If the other \nperson knows that person has HIV and chooses that behavior, whether it is sex \nor sharing a needle, then that person would not be guilty of the misdemeanor \neither—HIV is the only communicable disease where a felony would have been \nattached. Hopefully, this will change after passage of this bill. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe person who knows he or she has HIV and has sex with somebody is now \npotentially guilty of a misdemeanor, not a felony? \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nYes.  An  affirmative  defense  is  fairly  important;  if  those  relations  were \nconsensual, the person would not be guilty of the misdemeanor. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWhen you say consensual, do you mean consensual as in not rape, or do you \nmean, \"I am positive for HIV, and is it okay if I have sex with you?\" Is that \nwhat you mean by consensual? \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nYes, the latter. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nDoes  the  CDC  have  any  role  in  describing  this  affirmative  transmission \nfrequency or the science? Has the CDC weighed in on this? \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nAs far as the affirmative defense, the CDC does not play a role in that. We \npulled the affirmative defense from NRS. It already was in place for the felony \nwe are repealing, so we are moving that same language underneath this new \nsection. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nHas the CDC weighed in on the transmissibility risks of those interactions? \n \nMR. WADE: \nThe CDC has weighed in on active transmission, and recent research shows the \nrisk of HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is low, even if people are \nnot using condoms or taking medications that reduce risk. The CDC estimates \nthat the per act risk of transmission varies from close to zero percent to a \nmaximum average of 1.38 percent, depending on the type of intercourse. The \nactual rate of transmission is low.  \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nRegarding  the  definition  of  communicable  disease,  is  the  coronavirus  a \ncommunicable disease? \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nYes. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nChanges in section 2 include requiring people to isolate or quarantine for an \nexposure when they have been in an infectious state to prevent, suppress or \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \ncontrol  the  contagious  or  infectious  disease.  That  seems  counterintuitive  to \neverything we have done for the past year in terms of social distancing and \nisolation. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nCertainly all these laws predate coronavirus and were applied to coronavirus, \nbut these are more along tuberculosis and any other number of conditions. This \nbill actually does change the definition for all communicable diseases, not just \nHIV/AIDS. \n \nTORY JOHNSON (HIV/AIDS Program Director, Division of Public and Behavioral \nHealth, Department of Health and Human Services): \nI can only speak to HIV as that is my expert subject matter. Although I do work \nin public health, I am not well versed in Covid-19. I can get information, speak \nto my colleagues and get back to you. \n \nKYRA MORGAN (Chief Biostatistician, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nCovid-19 is a communicable disease. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWe need to explore changes related to the power of local health districts in \ngetting people to isolate under broader global pandemic-type conditions. When it \ncomes to section 7, it relates to testing of first responders and public health \nofficers who believe they have been exposed. This seems to make a significant \nchange that would require them to have had a negative test before. It does not \nsay when or if there was specific knowledge that the person who potentially \nexposed someone was infected. Can you explain that section, and what are we \ntrying to accomplish? \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nCertainly. This section was developed in consultation with the Clark County Fire \nDepartment. You are looking at compromise language we put together with \nfirst responders.  We  do  not  want  to  subject  people  to  unnecessary  testing, \nalthough we want to ensure our first responders are kept safe when they have \nbeen potentially exposed. This language accomplishes those dual goals. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nUnder this language, what is the process if police officers are in a confrontation \nand  have  bodily  fluids  exposed  to  them?  Under  what  conditions  are  they \nallowed to test? What is the incubation period for contracting communicable \ndiseases and how long after exposure would an individual start testing positive? \nCan medical interventions be used in that interim time to suppress or prevent \ninfection? \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nThe only test is to determine an appropriate treatment for the first responder, \nthen the testing could happen in conjunction with coming into contact with \nhuman blood or bodily fluids. \n \nMR. WADE: \nFor the record and to dispel some myths, there is no documented evidence of \ntransmission of HIV through biting, spitting, scratching or bodily fluids. This is \nsomething  the  Association  of  Prosecuting  Attorneys  has  researched  and \nendorsed in general HIV policy. We have to be clear that a lot of these thoughts \nabout how HIV is transmitted are incorrect. When we craft these laws, we need \nto  ensure  it  does  not  provide  misinformation  out  of  step  with  science  and \nstigmatizing. The way it is described here, it would not transmit HIV. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThis bill is about all communicable diseases, and I have been told for a year that \nI cannot breathe on people. We are trying to eliminate stigma and criminalization \nrelated to HIV, but a communicable disease is a broad term in that implications \ndownstream need to be considered. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nSection 7 has the provision stating you have to come in contact with human \nblood  or  bodily  fluids,  so  this  would  not  address  someone  breathing  on  a \nfirst responder. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWhat was the process for working with the health districts to ensure they are \ncomfortable with this bill? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nThe HIV Modernization Task Force had health district experts at the table from \nthe  beginning  to  develop  this  legislation.  There  was  plenty  of  discussion \nbetween HIV advocates and the health districts to get to the legislation you see \nbefore you. For that reason, the bill is a bit broader than just the sections that \nonly call out HIV. Both Washoe County Health District and Southern Nevada \nHealth District were important partners in getting to the bill we have today. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWe heard earlier from Mr. Cisneros about the arrest statistics related to the \ncriminalization provisions we are trying to eliminate. Are there any documented \ncases  of  infection  related  to  those  arrests  or  transmission  related  to  those \narrests? \n \nMR. CISNEROS: \nThe data we have from the Department of Public Safety is arrest information; \nwe do not have any public health data. \n \nQUENTIN SAVWOIR (Deputy Director, Make It Work Nevada; Member, Advisory \nTask Force on HIV Exposure Modernization): \nWe support S.B. 275. We are long past due for modernizing our State laws on \nHIV. Such laws are rooted in stigma and uncertainties around the virus that are \nno  longer  uncertain.  Furthermore,  laws  disproportionately  impact  Black \ncommunities and communities of color that are more likely living with HIV. This \nbody passed S.C.R. No. 1 of the 32nd Special Session declaring racism a public \nhealth crisis. This measure had bipartisan support in both chambers and is in \nalignment with the intentions of this Senate concurrent resolution. We can begin \nto curb the criminalization of Black and Latino communities living with HIV by \npassing S.B. 275. \n \nRO GIL: \nI  support  S.B.  275.  I  am  a  social  work  student  and  former  housing  case \nmanager  for  people  living  with  HIV.  This  bill  would  modernize  Nevada's \nHIV-related laws that perpetuate stigma against people living with HIV. I have \nseen the impact of stigma and discrimination on people living with HIV or AIDS. \nTo name a few, clients have endured loss of hope, feelings of worthlessness, \naddiction, isolation, depression and loss of income or livelihood. People exposed \nto societal stigma often undertake internalized stigma. Internal life stigma is the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nprocess in which people believe the negative messaging or stereotypes about \nthemselves, which can possibly harm them or others. \n \nSome outcomes and its effects include not getting tested for HIV because of \nthe  negative  consequences  with  knowing  one  has  HIV.  Modernization  is \nnecessary because these laws are failing to stop the spread of HIV, as Nevada \nis ranked eighteenth in the Nation for the number of diagnosed cases. These \nlaws continue to negatively impact Nevada residents and families. \n \nDAWN CHRISTENSEN (Nevada Resort Association): \nWe support S.B. 275. Nevada's resort industry has a long-standing commitment \nto  corporate  social  responsibility  (CSR)  programs  and  initiatives  and  has  a \nhistory of leadership in this space. The key pillars of most CSR programs are \nphilanthropy, environmental sustainability, diversity, equity and inclusion, which \nwork in tandem to strengthen our community and create better outcomes for \npeople and the planet. \n \nMore  than  two  years  ago,  the  Nevada  Resort  Association  created  its \nCSR coalition aimed at harnessing our members' individual CSR efforts through \na  collective  impact  model  of  collaboration  and  shared  goals  to  address  our \ncommunities'  challenges  and  make  a  greater  impact.  Diversity,  equity  and \ninclusion have become a priority for the coalition as we worked on increasing \naccess,  opportunity  and  equity  for  all.  Nevada  law  unfairly  targets  people \nbecause of their HIV status and disproportionately impacts certain communities \nmore likely living with HIV. Senate Bill 275 seeks to change that by modernizing \nour outdated laws that treat HIV differently from every other communicable \ndisease. \n \nKIMI COLE: \nI  support  S.B.  275.  This  is  an  opportunity  to  accurately  and  effectively \nrecognize scientific understanding of HIV and pass legislation to improve public \nhealth, while sparing taxpayers the unnecessary burden of paying for onerous \nand  ineffective  prosecutions.  Laws  have  done  nothing  to  mitigate  issues \noriginally  and  erroneously  intended  to  protect  society  that  accomplished  the \nopposite.  Outdated  laws  criminalize  an  affliction,  not  actions  that  cause \nintentional  harm  to  others.  Understanding  of  HIV  long  ago  passed  original, \narchaic and inaccurate perceptions of an affliction effectively monitored and \ntreated for long-term quality of life. It is time to correct this situation and move \non. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nJASMIN MARGARITA TOBON: \nI support S.B. 275. I am an organizer with Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada. \nNevada laws treat the HIV epidemic as a criminal offense rather than a public \nhealth crisis. With science and knowledge, we know better, and this is our \nopportunity to do better. Criminalization is not the answer and never was, but      \nscience  is.  Despite  advances  in  HIV  care  and  science,  Nevada's \nHIV criminalization laws are still based on decades-old science. Criminalization \ndiscourages  testing,  treatment  and  disclosure  resulting  in  stigma  and \npreventable deaths. Whether it is the horribly mismanaged AIDS epidemic in the \n1990s  or  the  coronavirus  pandemic,  Black,  Indigenous  and  People  of  Color \n(BIPOC) and LGBTQ individuals suffer the most and have led the movement for \njustice for their communities. This bill is an act of long-overdue justice and \naligns with the needs of Nevadans. \n \nJOHN PIRO (Deputy Public Defender, Clark County Public Defender's Office): \nWe support S.B. 275. This bill modernizes our laws to remove some of the \noutdated and discriminatory laws passed during a time when we as a society \nused HIV to stigmatize and discriminate against our LGBTQ community. Instead \nof dealing with HIV, which is a public health issue, Nevada's criminal code has \nbeen used as an ineffective hammer to solve problems the criminal code was \nnever designed to solve. As Maya Angelou instructed us \"do the best you can \nuntil you know better, and then when you know better, do better.\" We now \nknow better, and it is time to do better and modernize our laws. \n \nJADA HICKS (Supervising Attorney, The Center for HIV Law and Policy): \nWe support S.B. 275. There are 32 states that have HIV-specific laws that \nimpose  criminal  liabilities.  These  laws  impose  either  misdemeanor  or  felony \npunishment and explicitly target HIV. Results are found in criminal codes or \npublic  health  codes,  and  some  of  these  laws  define  criminal  offenses  for \nexposing others to HIV. Others outline harsher penalties for people living with \nHIV for acts already considered criminal. \n \nCriminalization of HIV is fueled primarily by the inaccurate belief that HIV is \neasily transmitted and fatal, neither of which is true. These laws conflict with \npublic health goals that laws have no impact on risky behavior or on the number \nof new HIV diagnoses. Learning about one's HIV status discourages individuals \nbecause they must know about their HIV status to face prosecution. It drags \nlaw enforcement into what is essentially a public health issue without training \non how these diseases are transmitted, prevented and treated. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nResearch shows most prosecutions target Black men and women, sex workers \nfor solicitation and those who suffer from mental illness. Government policies \nand outdated understanding of disease transmission also enshrined stigma at \nodds with public health campaigns and campaigns to end the epidemic. Many in \nlaw enforcement are not only supporting but leading the charge to approach \nHIV from a public health perspective instead of through the criminal justice legal \nsystem. \n \nALEX CAMBEROS (Battle Born Progress): \nWe support S.B. 275. We are a nonpartisan organization in Nevada to ensure \nfairness  and  equal  opportunity  to  succeed  for  all  Nevadans.  Nevada  laws \nregarding  criminalization  are  outdated,  ineffective  and  discriminatory.  I  have \nsubmitted my written testimony (Exhibit H). \n \nWESLEY JUHL (American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada): \nWe support S.B. 275. We support the work to take harmful stigma out of our \nState  laws.  I  say  ditto  to  the  other  policy  remarks.  As  a  queer  man,  my \nexperience has been that discussions about HIV and AIDS are far too often \ntangled up in homophobia and transphobia, and my sense is the same is true \nwith  Nevada's  criminalization  scheme.  When  looking  at  the  groups  most \nvulnerable to contracting HIV, it is clear this epidemic is also tangled up with \nracial and economic issues. Some of the first volunteer work I did in my early \n20s was HIV prevention outreach with the Center for HIV Law and Policy, and \nwe  always  said  get  tested  and  know  your  status.  The  sad  truth  is  that \ncriminalization  of  HIV  serves  as  a  major  obstacle  to  these  important  public \nhealth messages. \n \nKENDRA BERTSCHY (Deputy Public Defender, Washoe County Public Defender's \nOffice): \nWe support S.B. 275. I agree with the callers before me. This bill will allow \nindividuals with medical issues to be outside of the criminal justice system. I \nhave  had  a  handful  of  clients  who  indicated  they  became  involved  in  the \ncriminal justice system because of the stigma associated with their disease that \nled them to use alcohol and substances. This bill will help all Nevadans. \n \nCAITLIN GWIN (Sex Worker Alliance of Nevada): \nWe support S.B. 275. This bill will improve the health and safety of those who \nengage in sex work. The pattern of criminalization only makes it more likely that \nindividuals will continue in this work and make it harder for them to leave the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nindustry if they so desire. Criminal records make it harder to get traditional \nemployment. Expenses incurred throughout arrest and incarceration make these \npeople more financially vulnerable and more likely to engage in sex work. \n \nEMILY DRISCOLL (National Lawyers Guild, Las Vegas Chapter): \nWe support S.B. 275. Human immunodeficiency virus is the only disease that \ncriminalizes people just for having the disease. Nevada law does not protect \npeople but puts Nevadans at risk for transmission. It creates a disincentive to \npeople from getting HIV tests because knowing their status means they are \nmore likely to receive felony charges. Nevada laws governing HIV have put \nvulnerable Nevadans at risk for criminalization and unnecessary disease spread. \nThese  laws  disproportionately  affect  members  of  the  gay  community, \ntransgender  people  and  street-based  sex  workers,  all  of  whom  are \ndisproportionately impacted. \n \nIf this bill gets passed, Nevadans could safely seek treatment and testing for \nHIV and remain  nontransmittable without having to worry about the stigma \nsurrounding the virus. Existing laws come from fear and homophobic campaigns \nthat aim to harm people who did not fit the framework of an acceptable citizen. \nThese laws mainly affect BIPOC, gay, transgender and poor people. \n \nCONNIE SHEARER (The Nevada HIV Modernization Coalition): \nWe support S.B. 275. I am a 25-year survivor of HIV and one of the founding \ncochairs for the Nevada HIV Modernization Coalition. We should all care about \nreforming the outdated HIV criminalization laws in Nevada. Significant advances \nhave been made in our scientific understanding of HIV and medical interventions \navailable to treat it. Our laws should reflect this progress and not criminalize \nbehavior that poses no risk of transmission. The laws are preventing people \nfrom getting tested out of fear of being criminalized and getting into treatment \nthat we now know prevents the spread of HIV. \n \nThe daily treatment I receive is called antiretroviral therapy. I am what is known \nas virally suppressed which means the virus inside my body is unable to be \ntransmitted to someone with whom I am having a sexual relationship. There are \ncountless more like me who were exposed and acquired HIV but have not found \nout their status. That means they are untested, not in treatment, too afraid to \nget tested and possibly told by a doctor their symptoms are not HIV because \nthey are not in a high-risk group or because they do not have equitable access \nto treatment. We are not going to criminalize a public health issue away. Many \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \npeople who are not living with HIV do not understand it is not just the charges \nthat ruin people's lives. The stigmatizing language used by the media, public and \nthis  legislative  body  continues  to  perpetuate  outdated  myths  and  opinions. \nLanguage in this bill commits to modernizing outdated laws. \n \nJOANNA JACOB (Clark County): \nWe  are  neutral  on  S.B.  275.  I  have  been  working  with  Clark  County  Fire \nDepartment on this bill, specifically section 7. We are in support of the rest of \nthe bill, the stated testimony today and the goals of the Task Force. On behalf \nof the Clark County Firefighters and the unions who are testifying, the concerns \nwith section 7 are that it would pose a barrier, and we consider that a public \nhealth issue when we have first responders responding to an emergency and \ncome in contact with the public. If they are exposed to a communicable disease, \nwe must err on the side of safety for our employees and get them tested as \nsoon as possible to find out if they were exposed. We are continuing to work on \nthe language. However, we have concerns it is shifting the burden of proof in a \npublic health statute, and this is not a criminal statute. This is our concern \nbecause it applies to all communicable diseases. \n \nBRADLEY MAYER (Southern Nevada Health District): \nWe  are  neutral  on  S.B.  275.  We  will  continue  to  work  on  amendments \nespecially  related  to  the  communicable  disease  discussion  in  addition  to \nsections 7 and 11. \n \nALISA HOWARD (Owner, Minority Health Consultants): \nWe support S.B. 275. As a former HIV Ryan White Program Director and now \nthe  owner  of  Minority  Health  Consultants,  I  am  saddened  that  outdated, \nineffective and discriminatory Nevada laws that criminalize HIV are still here. \nThe CDC and State data show us HIV is the most dangerous, infectious disease \naside from Covid-19 which threatens the lives of minorities to include African \nAmericans, Latinx and LGBTQ communities that have the highest amounts of \nmorbidity and mortality. \n \nTODD INGALSBEE (Professional Fire Fighters of Nevada): \nWe  are  neutral  on  S.B.  275.  I  would  like  to  ditto  the  comments  made  by \nClark County regarding section 7. We support the bill and everything it does. \nWe just want to make sure our members are protected, tested—whether an \nintentional or accidental exposure—promptly for any communicable disease so \nwe are not spreading the disease and medicated to prevent us from getting the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \ndisease. We are neutral for now; however, we look forward to working together \nso we can all agree and get this bill passed. \n \nJENNIFER HOWELL (Sexual Health Program Coordinator, Washoe County Health \nDistrict): \nWe are neutral on S.B. 275. I also serve on the Governor's Advisory Task Force \non HIV Exposure Modernization and cochair the Northern Nevada HIV Prevention \nPlanning  Group.  Washoe  County  supports  the  modernization  of  HIV-related \nstatutes to match the extraordinary advances in HIV care and prevention. These \nefforts are needed to end the HIV epidemic, which is within our grasp. \n \nWashoe County Health District suggested amendments reflecting the collective \nfeedback of our public health partners, Southern Nevada Health District and \nongoing community discussion. Moving HIV into the public health realm and \naddressing it the same as other communicable diseases assists public health \nwith intervening in proven ways by expanding access, building trust within the \ncommunity  and  using  evidence-based  interventions  in  achieving  healthier \noutcomes. Yet, we have legislation allowing us to address and intervene in an \nexpeditious  manner  given  the  diverse  communicable  diseases  covered  in \nNRS 441A and NAC Chapter 441A. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nI am committed to working with Clark County Firefighters as well as our health \ndistrict partners to make sure we get this right. This has been a labor of love, \nand we are almost there. Although my name is on the bill, what you see is a \nproduct of decades of work by former Senator Parks. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe will now close the hearing on S.B. 275 and open the hearing on S.B. 379. \n \nSENATE  BILL  379:  Provides  for  the  collection  of  certain  data  concerning \nproviders of health care. (BDR 40-457) \n \nSENATOR JOSEPH P. HARDY (Senatorial District No. 12): \nI am presenting S.B. 379 on behalf of the Legislative Committee on Health Care. \nA group of stakeholders who came to the Interim Committee and heard its \nreport said we should do something. This resulted in the health workforce data \ncollection through the licensure renewal process. This bill talks about having a \nway to find who is doing what, where, when and how in the field of health \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \ncare. Upon the renewal of a license, certificate or registration as a provider of \nhealth  care,  we  are  asking  to  have  a  short,  confidential  survey  completed \nvoluntarily.  This  bill  will  probably  have  some  friendly  amendments. \nDr. John Packham will walk us through the process by which we would identify \npeople. The key in the bill is using language to attract more persons, including \nmembers of unrepresented groups, and improve health outcomes.   \n \nJOHN PACKHAM, M.D. (Associate Dean, Office of Statewide Initiatives, University \nof Nevada, Reno, School of Medicine): \nThe heart of this bill is to utilize licensure renewal for health providers in Nevada \nto capture better, more accurate and complete data on where they practice, the \nextent to which they represent or reflect the populations they serve and to \ninform public policy in Nevada. As a State, we are leaving money on the table \nwhen we do not accurately establish and maintain health professional shortage \narea  designations,  which  funnel  into  State  and  federal  reimbursement  for \nprofessionals serving in medically underserved areas. Licensure renewal provides \nthat mechanism to collect data better than we do now. This bill is not simply \nabout data collection. It will improve access to care, attract and keep health \nprofessionals in our State. I have submitted a written report (Exhibit I). \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThis bill is positive going forward to attract health professionals to come to \nNevada and stay here, looking and sounding like the people they serve. We have \nspecial groups of people who need care, and we have not been good at doing \nthis.  Many  times  in  the  bipolar  community,  we  need  to  get  people \nimmunizations, screenings and care, and develop a trust factor. This survey can \nhelp us determine who we need to recruit and how to keep them in our State. \nOne of the issues that comes up deals with confidentiality. We are working on \nlanguage,  along  with  our  stakeholders,  to  ensure  people  are  not  identified \nindividually by the survey results. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIs the data collection voluntary on the part of the providers and done through a \nweb portal directed straight to the Department of Health and Human Services \n(DHHS) and not the actual licensing boards via the amendment? \n \nDR. PACKHAM: \nThe idea is to use the licensure renewal. If physicians or nurses are renewing \ntheir licenses online, a link would take them to the DHHS website where they \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nwould complete the survey, return to their licensure renewal and submit it. The \nquestions would be voluntary. I would never want to do anything to stand in the \nway of an individual getting relicensed. We do not want to be a barrier. The idea \nwould  be  to  ask  questions  eight  to  ten  minutes  long  every  two years.  The \nquestions asked would tell us where the individuals practice, if they work in a \nhealth professional shortage area and so forth. There are ways to streamline \nquestions  to  make  the  survey  less  of  a  burden.  There  are  also  ways  to \nstreamline  the  survey  to  avoid  answering  the  same  questions  in  two  or \nfour years from now. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nI was concerned about the survey asking how many hours per week a doctor \nworks and whether he or she is planning to retire anytime in the next five years. \nWould these questions discourage individuals from filling out the survey? \n \nDR. PACKHAM: \nI am wary of questions compelling someone to not complete the survey, be it on \nretirement plans, race, ethnicity or the like. Respondents would be given the \noption to not reply with the hope they would complete the other questions. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe  are  referring  to  an  amendment,  and  it  would  be  helpful  to  have  clarity \nbecause multiple amendments were submitted, including from the Chiropractic \nPhysicians' Board of Nevada (Exhibit J), State Board of Osteopathic Medicine \n(Exhibit K) and the Board of Medical Examiners (Exhibit L). \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI anticipate they are all interested in the same things, and we will come to \ncommon language. \n \nJARON HILDEBRAND (Nevada State Medical Association): \nWe support S.B. 379. We believe in having more robust workforce data that will \nprovide us a solid roadmap to solve our provider shortage issue in this State. \n \nMR. MAYER:  \nSouthern Nevada Health District supports S.B. 379. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nNANCY BOWEN (Nevada Primary Care Association): \nWe support S.B. 379. I represent the State's community health centers which \nserve geographically isolated and traditionally underserved communities. In rural \nareas, they are often the only health care available, in urban areas, they serve \nMedicaid patients and uninsured who have no other access to services. I have \nsubmitted my written testimony (Exhibit M).  \n \nJOELLE GUTMAN DODSON (Washoe County Health District): \nWe  are  in  support  of  S.B.  379.  This  bill  is  good  for  public  health  and  for \nNevada. \n \nCODY  PHINNEY  (Deputy  Administrator,  Division  of  Health  Care  Financing  and \nPolicy, Department of Health and Human Services): \nWe are neutral on S.B. 379. The Department of Health and Human Services is \nconvinced this bill would allow the availability of this data to be beneficial to the \nprimary  care  office  and  its  efforts  toward  those  designations  for  health \nprofessional shortage areas. We are certain this data and the ability to analyze it \nwould allow us to get health professional services from people who look and \nsound like residents in those areas in a much better way than we can at this \ntime. We have the Office of Analytics on board to help with any concerns about \ndata privacy and on standby to help with any amendment. \n \nDAN MUSGROVE (Chiropractic Physicians' Board of Nevada): \nWe are neutral on S.B. 379. Everyone is interested in the confidentiality of this \ninformation which should not flow through the individual professional boards. \nOur amendment, Exhibit J, states the data should go directly to the Director of \nDHHS. Whatever portal the Director creates, we could easily figure out a way to \nverify that applicants or members of our boards have registered. It takes the \nboards out of the middle and provides further protection for confidential data. \n \nJOAN HALL (Nevada Rural Hospital Partners Foundation): \nWe support S.B. 379. This bill supports workforces we have been working on \nfor many years. This data will help underserved areas and have more accurate \ninformation about practice locations impacting service to people. \n \nSUSAN FISHER (State Board of Osteopathic Medicine): \nWe are neutral on S.B. 379. Our Board has not met in an open meeting to take \na formal position on this bill. We proposed an amendment, Exhibit K, as did the \nBoard  of  Medical  Examiners  whom  you  will  hear  from.  We  do  not  want \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nconfidential  information  given  to  us  because  it  could  cause  a  question  if  a \nprovider is denied a license because of something in his or her background or \ncriminal behavior. The proposed amendment would have the data go directly to \nDHHS, whether through a link on our website directly to DHHS or otherwise. \nWe would be agnostic on the language, whether you use our language or a \ncombination  thereof  from  the  Chiropractic  Board  and  Board  of  Medical \nExaminers. We did submit a fiscal note on this but do not know what it will cost \nto have information technology provide a link for us to the website. If there are \ncosts for additional staff time, we will have to estimate the fiscal note. \n \nKEITH LEE (Board of Medical Examiners): \nWe  are  neutral  on  S.B.  379.  We  have  submitted  a  proposed  amendment, \nExhibit L, and statement in neutral (Exhibit N). As my colleagues have testified, \nwe are close to the same language on a proposed amendment. We have a \nnewly installed state-of-the-art licensing and relicensing system. We can put a \nhyperlink  in  the  licensed  application  taking  the  applicant  directly  to  the \nDHHS survey. We will work with everyone to ensure this bill is passed and gets \nthe requested information to DHHS from our licensees while removing us from \nbeing the middle recipient, which could expose us to lawsuits based upon the \nknowledge of the information we have received. \n \nANTONINA CAPURRO, DMD (State Dental Health Officer, Division of Public and \nBehavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services): \nWe are neutral on S.B. 379. The Nevada Oral Health Program is committed to \nimproving the oral and overall health and well-being of Nevadans. To meet this \ngoal,  the  Program  puts  priority  on  the  present  and  future  needs  of  the \npopulation  and  dental  profession.  Reliable  data  is  limited  to  provider-patient \nratios identifying a lack of service after the fact. This does not provide real-time \ndata for long-term planning that accounts for changes in the dental workforce \nsuch as retirement needs, shifts in practice types and long-term retention in the \nState.  Intentions  to  accurately  monitor  and  gather  data  on  the  supply  of \ncompetent  oral  health  professionals  that  inform  the  Oral  Health  Program's \ndecisions are critical to ensure access to care for vulnerable and underserved \npopulations. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will now close the hearing on S.B. 379 and open the hearing on S.B. 376. \n \nSENATE BILL 376: Revises provisions relating to child welfare. (BDR 38-503) \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nSENATOR JAMES OHRENSCHALL (Senatorial District No. 21): \nI was lucky to chair the Legislative Committee on Child Welfare and Juvenile \nJustice. We came up with recommendations for ten bill draft requests (BDRs) as \nwell as letters on important issues affecting Nevada's children in our report \n(Exhibit  O).  Almost  all  of  our  recommendations  came  back  with  unanimous \nvotes with bipartisan support. One of the recommendations is S.B. 376. \n \nA concern was brought forth to the Committee when an allegation of abuse and \nneglect of a child occurs. Under law, the allegation is either substantiated or \nunsubstantiated. Many of the men and women who are tasked with protecting \nour children in Nevada felt this did not tell the whole story in terms of looking at \nwhat might have happened to a child in the past. The person evaluating the \nchild needs to know about other factors and the child's circumstances. That is \nthe genesis of this bill. Clark County has worked hard with other jurisdictions \nand written an amendment (Exhibit P) to this bill. \n \nMS. JACOB: \nWe will go through a quick presentation and Timothy Burch will go through the \ncategories  Clark  County  is  proposing  to  add  to  Nevada  law  through  the \namendment, Exhibit P. The amendment is a product of working with our other \nwelfare agency partners, and the language is a consensus of all. \n \nTIMOTHY BURCH (Administrator, Human Services, Clark County): \nI  will  go  through  the  presentation  (Exhibit  Q)  and  the  importance  of  the \nproposed  changes.  The  purpose  of  child  welfare  is  to  promote  the  safety, \npermanency and well-being of children and help make sure families can take \ncare  of  those  children  properly.  When  they  cannot,  child  welfare  finds \npermanency options with family or through adoption. \n \nOne  of  the  most  important  functions  we  can  serve  ensures  the  safety  of \nchildren is done properly through the investigation and disposition of reports of \nchild abuse and neglect. These case dispositions help in many ways. They help \nframe the interventions performed with these families and children, and they \ninform future investigations, both for child welfare and law enforcement, about \nthe outcome or disposition of these cases if their substantiations go into the \nCentral  Repository  for  Nevada  Records  of  Criminal  History.  These  Central \nRepository  records  help  to  conduct  investigations,  provide  appropriate \ntreatments  and,  most  importantly,  screen  people's  backgrounds  who  are \nentrusted with the care of children and the elderly according to NRS 432B.100. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nSubstantiated  dispositions  determine  reasonable  cause  to  believe  abuse  or \nneglect occurred and the alleged perpetrator is responsible for said abuse or \nneglect. Unsubstantiated dispositions mean a determination was unable to be \nmade through insufficient evidence or the inability to determine whether the \nalleged perpetrator was responsible for the abuse or neglect. \n \nThe proposal to amend NRS 432B.300, subsection 6 adds two case dispositions \nin addition to the categories of substantiated and unsubstantiated—\"unable to \ncomplete\"  and  \"administrative  closure\"—and  changes  the  standard  of  proof \nfrom \"reasonable cause to believe\" to \"preponderance.\" This is in alignment \nwith State regulations and policies. \n \nMS. JACOB: \nIn the Clark County amendment, Exhibit P, we are proposing to change a report \ndisposition from \"unable to complete\" to \"unable to locate or contact.\" The \ndefinition of unable to locate or contact is what Mr. Burch said; however, we \nneed to clear this with the child welfare agencies.  \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIn the language being struck, is there a reason why we are not seeing the \ncategory \"unable to determine?\" \n \nSENATOR OHRENSCHALL: \nThat  language  is  in  the  Texas  statutory  scheme  and,  although  part  of  the \noriginal amendment, it did not reach consensus in the proposed amendment. \n \nAMBER HOWELL (Director of Human Services, Washoe County): \nWe support S.B. 376.  \n \nALEXIS  TUCEY  (Deputy  Administrator,  Division  of  Child  and  Family  Services, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nWe are neutral on S.B. 376. We appreciate the changes regarding improvements \nfor  the  child  welfare  agencies,  serving  the  populations  in  Nevada  for  this \nparticular group and utilizing the information for needed changes and seeing the \ntrue picture of what is happening with our youth. \n \nMS. BERTSCHY:  \nThe Washoe County Public Defender's Office is in neutral on S.B. 376. My \noffice represents parents who are involved in neglect and abuse actions. Our \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \nonly concern left is to ensure the new designations for disposition categories are \nnot  reported  to  the  Central  Repository.  We  want  to  ensure  only  the \nsubstantiated  designations  are  reported  because  these  do  have  significant \nconsequences in terms of obtaining employment, housing and social services. It \nis our understanding the intent of this bill is that the unsubstantiated, unable to \nlocate  or  contact,  or  administrative  closure  categories  will  not  have  a  legal \nimpact on parents. \n \nMS. JACOB: \nIt  is  our  understanding  only  substantiated  dispositions  are  reported  to  the \nCentral  Repository.  However,  if  it  will  alleviate  concerns  from  the \nWashoe County Public Defender's Office, we are amenable to adding language \nto the amendment. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will now close the hearing on S.B. 376. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nI will open the hearing on S.B. 391. \n \nSENATE BILL 391: Revises provisions relating to dentistry. (BDR 40-455) \n \nSENATOR JULIA RATTI (Senatorial District No. 13): \nI  am  presenting  a  bill  that  was  one  of  the  ten  BDRs  recommended  by  the \nLegislative Committee on Health Care. This bill is about oral health in Nevada \nand its status, which is not good. Dr. Antonina Capurro, State Dental Health \nOfficer, did a lot of work to find best practices, look at what other states are \ndoing and come forward with a number of ideas on how to improve the status \nof oral health in Nevada. Some of those ideas cost money; by the time we \npresented at the Interim Committee, we were in a pandemic, and the impact of \nthe pandemic on the budget became clear. \n \nDr. Capurro and I discussed ways to help strengthen oral health in Nevada. We \nlooked at three significant concepts. First was an insurance concept, dental loss \nratio and how to ensure we have a good balanced approach while patients get \nthe  most  from  their  insurance.  Second,  we  looked  to  see  if  we  were  well \nsituated to use oral health providers to the highest and best of their ability in an \nemergency capacity and the infrastructure built around emergencies. Third was \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \nteledentistry  and  State  laws  regarding  teledentistry.  The  Interim  Committee \nasked we move forward with those three things. \n \nThe insurance piece became quite complicated. In the amendment (Exhibit R), all \nsections of the bill related to the dental loss ratio were removed. There are no \ninsurance components in this bill. However, the teledentistry and the emergency \nresponder pieces are strong. We also looked at the licensing requirements for \nthe  two  professional  positions  in  DHHS,  which  are  the  State  Dental  Health \nOfficer  and  State  Public  Health  Dental  Hygienist,  and  changed  some  of  the \nlicensing requirements in an effort to give the State better capacity for recruiting \nefforts. \n \nThe bill includes teledentistry, emergency providers and changes to the licensing \nrequirements for the top oral health professionals in our State. Dr. Capurro will \nwalk you through what the bill accomplishes. \n \nDR. CAPURRO: \nI am joined by Jessica Woods, Interim State Public Health Dental Hygienist. The \nobjective  of  the  bill  is  to  adapt  to  the  landscape  of  oral  health  which  has \nchanged  as  a  result  of  the  pandemic  and  to  create  infrastructure  ensuring \naccess to dental care for all Nevadans. Many of the lessons learned during the \npandemic include the expansion of teledentistry which has been used without a \nframework,  as  well  as  the  inclusion  of  dental  professionals  as  emergency \nresponders. We can and should use these lessons learned to frame the future. \nThis  bill  will  establish  the  framework  for  teledentistry  to  reduce  traditional \nbarriers to care, foster equality, adapt an innovative service model and define \nthe education and training required for an oral health professional to respond to \na public health disaster or state of emergency. It will also create a Committee \non Dental Emergency Management.  \n \nThe three key goals are to sustain the teledentistry services that have become a \nnew  delivery  method  to  increase  access  to  care.  We  want  to  expand  the \nhealthcare  workforce  available  as  a  search  support  for  major  disasters, \npandemics,  forensic  identification  and  administrative  readiness  planning.  We \nalso want to prepare for any future public health emergencies or disasters by \ncreating the Committee on Dental Emergency Management. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nA late-coming amendment submitted by Jesse Wadhams of the Nevada Hospital \nAssociation (Exhibit S) is a minor friendly amendment to how information is \ndisseminated to patients. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nDoes this bill have a fiscal note? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nWe have not received the fiscal note on this bill yet; however, based upon \ncontent remaining in the bill, there could be a modest fiscal note. \n \nDR. CAPURRO: \nThe  Oral  Health  Program  would  absorb  any  costs  associated  with  the \nCommittee on Dental Emergency Management. There would be no fiscal note. \n \nMATTHEW ROBINSON (Liberty Dental Plan): \nWe  support  S.B.  391.  Liberty  Dental  Plan  is  the  State  dental  benefits \nadministrator for children on Medicaid in Clark and Washoe Counties. We are \nproud to employ over 200 people in Clark County as we work to ensure Nevada \nhas access to the best possible dental care. \n \nWe have made efforts to mitigate some of the worst impacts of the pandemic \nover  the  last  year,  which  include  providing  6,000  dental  kits  to  children  in \nWashoe and Clark Counties and building out teledentistry services to ensure our \nkids did not fall behind on their oral health. We chose providers over profit and \ndid  not  retroactively  bill  them  for  the  6  percent  rate  cut  mandated  by  the \nLegislative Special Session. \n \nIn an effort to alleviate emergency rooms (ER), we developed a program so \npatients  with  oral  pain  did  not  tie  up  ER  staff  with  issues  which  might  be \naddressed in other ways. Liberty Dental Plan teamed up with the University of \nNevada,  Las  Vegas  (UNLV),  School  of  Dental  Medicine  to  launch  the \nUNLV Children's Dental Prevention Clinic in January. This is a small part of \nwhat we do, and we are proud of the work we have done in Nevada to provide \nthe best dental care in the market. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 27 \n \nHELEN FOLEY (Delta Dental): \nWe support S.B. 391. Delta Dental is the largest dental insurance company in \nthe Country, serving 36 million patients. During Covid-19, we were quick to \nembrace and support teledentistry. This has been through encouraging the use \nof teledentistry by our dentists in all states where it is legal and supporting \nefforts in other states like Nevada to clear any obstacles. This is in addition to \nthe measures we have taken during the pandemic to support our providers, \ncustomers, enrollees and communities through substantial financial assistance.  \n \nANNETTE LINCICOME (Nevada Dental Hygienists Association): \nWe support S.B. 391. I am an actively licensed, registered dental hygienist in \nNevada speaking on behalf of the Nevada Dental Hygienists Association. We \nhave submitted supporting testimony (Exhibit T). \n \nVILAS SASTRY, DMD (Chief Executive Officer, Teledentistry.com): \nWe  support  S.B.  391.  Over  the  last  several  years,  we  have  worked  with \npartners  to  create  and  deploy  a  solution  helping  countless  Nevadans  and \nincreasing access to care. \n \nEDDIE ABLESER (Nevada Dental Association): \nWe support S.B. 391.  \n \nJESSE WADHAMS (Nevada Hospital Association): \nWe are neutral on S.B. 391. The hospital emergency department is an incredibly \nbusy  place  and  focused  on  emergent  care.  The  amendment  would  help  us \noperationalize  the  goals  of  the  legislation.  We  have  submitted  a  conceptual \namendment, Exhibit S. \n \n \n \nRemainder of page intentionally left blank; signature page to follow. \n   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 28 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe will close the hearing on S.B. 391.

(Director,  Policy  and  Programs/Oregon \nPrescription Drug Program, Oregon Health Authority): \nI  will  provide  background  on  the  Northwest  Prescription  Drug \nConsortium (Exhibit  P),  where  the  consortium  came  from  and  what  our \nexperience has been in Oregon and Washington. The most important thing is the \nannual market check on the rates, fees and guarantees. We are transparent. It is \nour goal to get the lowest-cost prescriptions for our program and participants. \n \nSpread  elimination  is  a  critical  element  in  cost  management.  Spread  occurs \nwhen pharmacy benefit management can hold a contract with a pharmacy by \nestablishing  a  rate  of  payment  for  drugs  and  holds  a  second  contract  with \ninsurers for a rate paid for those medications. \n \nThe consortium is designed to meet the needs of the public sector. We serve \nsome private entities but have multiple programs which can offer solutions to \nanyone. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nBETH  SLAMOWITZ,  Pharm.D.  (Senior  Policy  Advisor  on  Pharmacy,  Nevada \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nI will read from my written remarks (Exhibit Q). This bill authorizes nonprofits \nand  for-profit  private  entities  to  join  interstate  and  intrastate  purchasing \ncoalitions. \n \nSENATOR DONATE: \nThere is a conceptual amendment (Exhibit R) to the bill. \n \nOur  Public  Employees'  Benefits  Program  can  enter  into  an  agreement  if  it \nchooses. This bill goes beyond Medicaid, Public Employees' or current State or \nlocal government entities. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThis bill came from the Committee to Conduct an Interim Study Concerning the \nCosts of Prescription Drugs. The amendment essentially says please disregard \nthe bill. Our intent is to add the groups referenced in the amendment. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIs there a point at which the number of lives makes the program feasible? What \nis the point for tipping the economies of scale? \n \nDR. DOUGLASS: \nWe started small and grew to afford and avail ourselves of discounts. We have \nbuilt  considerations  into  contracting  for  economies  of  scale.  As  we  grow, \nadministrative fees will be reduced. At certain group sizes, there will be more \naggressive pricing and our position will improve.  \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nTo summarize, as you grow, are you finding the value and savings, forcing all \nrebates  to  come  to  the  consumer?  Rebates  are  not  being  captured  by  the \nmiddleman and not benefiting the user of those medications. Is that a big area \nwhere you are finding savings? \n \nDR. DOUGLASS: \nIt is a considerable one. Are you suggesting the rebates go back to consumers? \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nNo, not directly to the consumer, but its value goes into administering the plan. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nDR. DOUGLASS: \nThat is correct. The rebate revenue will be passed through to the insurer. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIs the product data management (PDM) a fixed administrative rate? \n \nDR. DOUGLASS: \nThat is correct. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWhat other categories are you able to find savings for the $169 million you \nidentified? Is it efficient purchasing power? \n \nDR. DOUGLASS: \nOther areas of capturing savings are on the administrative fee side. As we \ngrow, we are able to reduce those per claim on a per-member per-month basis, \ndepending  on  what  the  plan  chooses.  We  consistently  require  our  PDM  to \nnegotiate market rates. Our discounts are competitive in the marketplace.  \n \nOur group price online (GPO) savings allow state entities that purchase and take \npossession of medications to benefit from the GPO relationship and lower costs. \nThe individual prescription discount card benefit can save on prescriptions. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIs the amendment to delete the existing provision of S.B. 396 and authorize \nnonprofit and for-profit private entities to join interstate and intrastate coalitions \nfor prescription drugs? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe  can  do  that  for  governmental  agencies  but  not  agencies  listed  in  the \namendment. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nUnder the proposed amendment, would the nonprofits and for-profits have to be \nin partnership with a Nevada State agency to join an out-of-state coalition, or \ncould they do that independently? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nDR. SLAMOWITZ: \nThey could join independently. The intent is to allow groups to cross state lines \nand coordinate. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWhat is to prevent a private entity from crossing state lines? \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nA private entity can enter into an agreement with another private entity across \nstate lines. This bill would allow those agreements across state lines to include \ngovernmental and private entities inside and outside Nevada. \n \nMedicare and Medicaid can enter into agreements with other governmental and \nprivate entities, but other private entities inside Nevada could not enter into \nthose agreements. This bill would allow a Nevada private entity to join those \nagreements with public and private entities in other states and public entities in \nNevada. \n \nBONNIE MACQUARRIE: \nWhen I became sick, my doctor told me about a program that a manufacturer \nhad to help patients. The difference in cost saved my savings. People who need \nexpensive medications before being eligible for Medicare need these plans. \n \nMAYA HOLMES (Culinary Health Fund): \nWe support S.B. 396. It is needed to leverage the State's purchasing power by \nincluding public and private entities to secure prescription drugs at reasonable \ncosts. A purchasing coalition  is more essential as the result of COVID-19's \nfinancial impact on the State's economy and budget. \n \nSTACIE SASSO (Executive Director, Health Services Coalition): \nCreating a purchasing coalition is another step forward in achieving affordable \nhealthcare access. The State needs to make changes to positively impact the \neconomy and budget. \n \nNANCY CLARKE: \nI worked in the insurance industry for more than 20 years and watched as the \ncare costs became a crisis when driven by the cost of prescription drugs. We hit \nthe Medicare donut hole when we pay almost the full cost of prescription drugs \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nfor several months. Too many people are choosing to be sick because the cost \nof medication is too high. \n \nMAXMILLIAN LOWE: \nThis  would  help  Nevadan's  lower  the  cost  of  health  care  in  order  to  help \nthemselves.  \n \nAMY KOO (One APIA Nevada): \nBy lowering drug costs, we encourage Asian Americans to seek medical care \nand affordable health insurance.  \n \nRABBI BENJAMIN ZOBER: \nI support S.B. 396. Increasing access to health care is vital and a community \nobligation.  Sickness  is  not  a  divine  punishment.  As  a  community,  we  can \nprovide access to health care. \n \nBARRY GOLD (AARP Nevada): \nPrescription drugs are one of the main drivers of the increase in healthcare \ncosts. Lifesaving drugs do not work if you cannot afford to purchase them. \nAmerica should not be paying the highest drug costs in the world. This will \nlower the cost of prescription drugs to the consumers. \n \nAMBER FALGOUT (Manager, Northern Nevada Battle Born Progress): \nI have submitted my statement (Exhibit S) in writing. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe will close the hearing on S.B. 396 and open the hearing on S.B. 201. \n \nSENATE BILL 201: Requires licensing of pharmaceutical sales representatives. \n(BDR 54-444) \n \nSENATOR FABIAN DONATE (Senatorial District No. 10): \nI will read from my presentation (Exhibit T) of S.B. 201. \n \nDR. SLAMOWITZ: \nI have written remarks (Exhibit U) to present. \n \n \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nSENATOR DONATE: \nThe conceptual amendment (Exhibit V) provides the fee for licensure and how \nthese fees will be used. \n \nSTEPHANIE  WOODARD,  PSY.D.  (Medical  Epidemiologist  Senior  Advisor  on \nBehavioral Health, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, Department of \nHealth and Human Services): \nOver the past six years, I have had the opportunity to work with communities \nand  families  impacted  by  the  opioid  crisis.  It  has  been  established  that  the \nopioid crisis in Nevada was driven by overprescribing the opioid medication.  \n \nI have been asked to provide additional context to the scope of overprescribing \nin Nevada and the resulting fatalities. In 2011, the national average for states \nfor prescribing opioids was 68 prescriptions for every 100 people. In Nevada, \nthe  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  estimated  there  were \n100 prescriptions  for  100  people.  In  2016,  4  of  Nevada's  counties  had \nprescribing rates greater than 125 prescriptions per 100 people. As Senator \nDonate mentioned, the opioid crisis has resulted in high rates for emergency \nroom and inpatient care. Opioid overdoses have resulted in over 4,500 overdose \ndeaths in Nevada since 2010. \n \nTo address the mounting overdoses and high rates of prescribing, the Nevada \nLegislature passed A.B. No. 474 of the 79th Session which put forth prescribing \nguidelines  for  controlled  substances  including  opioids.  During  our  work  to \ndevelop that bill, we spoke with prescribers across the State and discussed the \ndrivers for the high rates of prescribing. We heard from prescribers who felt \npressured to prescribe by assessing and treating pain as the fifth vital sign. \nAggressive marketing strategies promoted opioid prescribing as not only safe \nbut necessary in managing a patient's pain.  \n \nWe  have  made  progress  in  addressing  overprescribing  since  implementing \nA.B. No. 474 of the 79th Session and have seen rates of prescribing decrease \nby 40 percent. Additional measures to reduce Nevada's risk of being impacted \nby similar marketing strategies in the future are needed to protect our citizens. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIf we want to get rid of the opioid crisis, we need to act on what we have done \nin Nevada with A.B. No. 474 of the 79th Session, by registering those who are \npushing the opioids, not every pharmaceutical technician or representative. We \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nare going up in fentanyl and heroin deaths. We are not doing the right thing by \nregistering every pharmaceutical representative.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWas the opioid crisis the most-documented and best-studied example of the \nimpact of marketing on behavior?  \n \nSENATOR DONATE: \nBased  on  the  information  shared  on  the  opioid  crisis,  we  know  the \nconsequences that could arise in the pharmaceutical industry with marketing \nand its association with prescribing medications. The opioid epidemic was a \nclear example highlighted in the past few years.  \n \nAnother study conducted by JAMA Internal Medicine mentioned physicians who \nreceive email promote the drug interests at higher rates of prescribing certain \ndrugs. Requiring the licensure of pharmaceutical representatives in Nevada will \nallow physicians the necessary tool to double-check and report any potential \nabuse or wrongdoing they observe and to ensure the representatives are being \nheld to the highest standard. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nOne  of  the  reasons  we  have  pharmaceutical  representations  is  to  use \nappropriate medicines correctly. It is not unusual for a new drug to outperform \nan old drug. Physicians are amendable to the educational experience they get \nwith drug representatives. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe pharmaceutical representatives have become a part of the care team, but \nthat part is blind to the public and the State. With every healthcare profession \nwe have a majority who work within the ethics, but some do not. The data from \na transparency standpoint shows members of the team need to be known and \ntrained to be included in the patient mix. \n \nMS. LOWE: \nI support the bill because licensing pharmaceutical representatives will help with \ntransparency  between  doctors,  prescribers  and  patients.  We  should  regulate \nmarketing because a pill does not always make an issue better.  \n \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nRANDI LAMPERT: \nI am a pediatrician in Las Vegas. I support this package of bills. I have seen the \nharm  prescribing  drugs  has  caused  entire  families.  This  bill  creates \naccountability.  My  patients  and  their  families  deserve  to  know  sales \nrepresentatives are held accountable. \n \nJANE HORVATH (Horvath Health Policy): \nLicensed  professionals  met  standards  for  knowledge,  training  and  business \nbehavior. Drug marketing can have significant effect on our health, safety and \nspending.  This  bill  sets  some  basic  standards  for  sales  representatives' \nbehaviors  and  delegate's  development  of  regulations  to  the  Department  of \nHealth and Human Services which can have additional standards for knowledge \nand ethics. \n \nMS. FALGOUT: \nDrug  companies  must  be  held  to  a  higher  level  of  accountability.  This  will \nrequire the registration of all drug representatives and set a higher bar for ethical \nbehavior. We need transparency in Nevada. \n \nMS. SASSO: \nPharmaceutical representatives are one of the main sources of drug marketing \nto  physician  groups.  They  have  a  goal  of  increasing  utilization  of  their \nbrand-named  drugs,  increasing  sales  for  the  drug  company  and  potentially \nsteering  patients  to  higher  out-of-pocket  copayments  because  of  use  of  a \nname-brand  drug  in  place  of  a  generic  product.  Requiring  licensure  of \npharmaceutical representatives in the State will protect patients and physicians. \n \nMS. HOLMES: \nPharmaceutical  representatives  play  a  significant  role  for  drug  company \nmarketing of  brand-named  drugs.  They provide information to  physicians on \ndrugs, but a key piece of their position is increasing drug company sales which \ncan result in steering patients to drugs with higher prices. Physicians are often \nnot aware of healthcare costs. The pharmaceutical industry spends billions on \ndirect marketing to physicians. To protect patients and physicians, it makes \nsense to require licensure, set practice standards and prohibit pharmaceutical \nrepresentatives from engaging in misleading marketing. \n \nASHER LISEC (Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America): \nI have submitted a written statement (Exhibit W) in opposition to this bill. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nTransparency says accountability. Right now, the representatives register. But if \na complaint occurs, is there any process to deal with that complaint? What \npower does DHHS have if there is a complaint? \n \nDR. SLAMOWITZ: \nThe Department is simply a depository of information. This includes who the \nrepresentatives visit and if gifts are greater than $10, what they are and what \ncategory  they  fall  into.  There  is  nothing  in  terms  of  regulatory  authority, \ndisciplinary action and accountability in terms of requirements for education or \nethics standards. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe will close the hearing on S.B. 201 and open the hearing on S.B. 364. \n \nSENATE BILL 364: Revises provisions relating to emergency medical care for a \nvictim of sexual assault or attempted sexual assault. (BDR 40-1004) \n \nSENATOR MELANIE SCHEIBLE (Senatorial District No. 9): \nI am joined by Talia Pellegrino who will go over the details of the bill and explain \nits  value.  This  bill  requires  that  emergency  rooms  provide  emergency \ncontraceptives to victims of sexual assault.  \n \nThis is not in response to anybody who has failed to treat a victim of sexual \nassault with dignity or respect. This is to ensure Nevadans receive the highest \nquality of health care in Nevada hospitals. \n \nTALIA PELLEGRINO (Access to Healthcare Network): \nI will read the written presentation (Exhibit X) for S.B. 364. \n \nKATIE ROBBINS (Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada): \nVictims  of  sexual  assault  should  have  access  to  safe  and  time-sensitive \nemergency  contraceptives  at  emergency  rooms.  Rather  than  having  to  seek \nemergency contraceptives from a separate provider at a later time, S.B. 364 \nwould allow victims to get the care they need quickly and safely. Emergency \ncontraceptives are safe and used to prevent pregnancy, not end one.  \n \n \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nMARLENE LOCKARD (Nevada Women's Lobby): \nThis important bill makes it easier and more accessible for victims of sexual \nassault  to  access  emergency  contraception,  which  is  not  an  abortion.  It \nprevents a pregnancy from taking place and is most effective when taken within \n24  hours  of  the  implant  from  the  sexual  encounter.  Victims  have  faced  an \nintense trauma, and they must do a number of things after the encounter to \nprevent  pregnancy.  We  support  any  measures  taken  to  make  this  process \neasier. This bill will allow a victim of a sexual assault to get necessary medicine \nwithout having to go to a second location.  \n \nMS. LOWE: \nI support S.B. 364, but I would like to know if there is anything in the bill for \npeople with disabilities to explain to them what has happened and what they \nneed to do to report the action. \n \nMS. FALGOUT: \nI  am  submitting  my  written  support  on  behalf  of  Battle  Born  Progress \n(Exhibit Y). \n \nCAROLINE MELLO ROBERSON (NARAL Pro-Choice America): \nMy written testimony in support (Exhibit Z) has been submitted. \n \nSERENA EVANS (Nevada Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual Violence): \nI  want  to  echo  what  Ms.  Roberson  said.  The  Coalition  was  involved  with \nA.B. No. 124 of the 80th Session, which established that the Division of Public \nand Behavioral Health create a pamphlet that all victims and survivors of sexual \nassault receive. The piece of emergency contraception was originally in this bill \nbut was amended out. \n \nThis bill is important because the first point of contact for victims of sexual \nassault  is  usually  an  emergency  room  to  seek  medical  care.  They  are  then \ndirected to an exam facility or told to report to law enforcement to get the \nemergency contraception. It is important that victim survivors are treated with \ncompassion and given access to emergency contraception whether or not they \nchoose to submit themselves to an exam. Victims from rural communities have \nto travel to a nonvictim facility when all they want is emergency contraception. \nAll  hospitals  should  have  the  emergency  contraception  on  hand  and  should \ndispense the medication when requested. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWhat is contraception? Does another definition clarify the use of an IUD? \n \nSENATOR SCHEIBLE: \nThis  bill  addresses  emergency  contraceptives  which  includes  hormonal \ncontraceptives taken within 24 to 72 hours of unprotected sexual contact to \nprevent pregnancy. Other types exist that are not addressed by this bill, and I \nam not sure they would be utilized in an emergency situation. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI think emergency contraception is an oral contraceptive such as Plan B. If it is \nother than that, I would like know. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs there a definition for emergency contraception? \n \nSENATOR SCHEIBLE: \nThe bill does not define an emergency contraceptive.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nDoes it include anything other than the birth control pill? \n \nSENATOR SCHEIBLE: \nThe bill, as drafted, is any emergency contraceptive. In most cases that would \nmean the morning-after pill. If a woman who presents at the emergency room \nhas experienced an assault, is seen by a qualified professional and wants to get \nan IUD that day instead of taking an oral contraceptive, that would also meet \nthe requirements of the bill.  The doctor could insert an IUD in lieu of offering \nher the emergency contraceptive. That would not allow someone who is not \nqualified and authorized to insert an IUD. \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nIn section 2, subsection 5, paragraph (a), \"emergency contraception is defined \nto mean methods of birth control which, when administered within a specified \nperiod after intercourse, may prevent pregnancy from occurring.\" If an IUD fits \nwithin that definition, it would be included in the definition. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWith no amendment to the bill, I will entertain a motion on the bill? \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER MOVED TO DO PASS S.B. 364. \n \n  SENATOR HARRIS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \n  THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe will close the hearing on S.B. 364.  \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nWe will open the hearing on S.B. 380. \n \nSENATE  BILL  380:  Revises  provisions  governing  the  reporting  of  data \nconcerning the prices of prescription drugs. (BDR 40-445) \n \nSENATOR JULIA RATTI (Senatorial District No. 13): \nOne  of  the  conversations  of  the  Committee  to  conduct  an  Interim  Study \nConcerning the Costs of Prescription Drugs was about how we take the next \nstep on transparency. We were hearing from constituents about problems with \ncosts. We know how pharmaceutical representatives interact with providers and \nhow pricing is set.  \n \nTwo things were recommended from the Interim study. First is to expand the \nuniverse of drugs we are looking at and then to narrow down to drugs that cost \na certain amount of money and those that are growing in price. \n \nIn the conceptual amendment of the bill (Exhibit AA), the Department of Health \nand Human Services compiles an annual list of prescription drugs costing more \nthan $40 for a course of treatment, whether for a month or a single shot, \nwherein the wholesale acquisition cost of those drugs increases by 10 percent \nor more. \n \nThe second thing the bill does is include registration and transparency measures \nof the supply chain. The bill asks for reporting from some of the chains on the \ntop 25 drugs within their universe.  \n \nThere are many people involved in getting the drug from the manufacturer to \nthe patient.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nDR. SLAMOWITZ: \nI have written remarks (Exhibit AB) that I will cover. \n  \nSENATOR HARDY: \nA  month's  worth  of  medicine  costing  less  than  $40  would  be  unusual.  Is \neverything over $40 going to be studied or just the top 25? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThere are two parts to the bill. The first is applying transparency laws that \nalready exist for asthma and diabetes to another class of drugs which costs \nover $40 for a month of therapy and has 10 percent or more annual price \ngrowth. We are talking about the wholesale acquisition price. For those drugs \nwe would apply the transparency statutes we have for asthma and diabetes, \nrequiring  pharmaceutical  companies  to  report  the  same  things  we  currently \nrequire for asthma and diabetes. \n \nThe second thing is from third parties, like an insurance company. They spend \nmoney on the 25 top drugs so we can better see the supply chain. We are not \ntalking about information we are asking for from the pharmaceutical companies \nbut from the third parties. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nHow will the $30,000 administrative penalty, usually used for the General Fund, \nbe used? What is the fiscal note on this? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nWe did not put anything into statute for what the money could be used for, so \nit  just  went  into  an  account  and  has  been  sitting  there.  We  have  about \n$1 million in accumulated fines but have not had a use for the money stipulated \nby law. The amendment allows existing money to be used for furthering the \ntransparency efforts as well as any new fines collected. Staff needs to collect \nthe information, and we need the resources to keep the program going. \n \nI do not believe the fiscal note has been published on this bill yet. \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nWe heard S.B. 396 earlier. How does this mesh with that? \n \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThe  goal  of the  Interim Committee was to find  how to cap pharmaceutical \ncosts.  Senate  Bill  396  addresses  the  ability  for  state  governments  with \nMedicaid, nonprofits and private entities to remove the barriers so they can join \na coalition to increase their purchasing power.  \n \nSenate Bill 380 builds the transparency of pharmaceutical companies so the \nreports provide the input to show how they get to the pricing. We only know \nabout  asthma  and  diabetes  drugs.  If  we  expand  this,  we  will  know  about \nanother group of drugs based on their expense and price going up 10 percent or \nmore  a  year,  and  we  will  know  more  about  all  of  the  suppliers,  pharmacy \nbenefits managers, insurance companies and wholesalers. Each has a role to \nplay in adding to the price and can provide the additional information we want \nto learn about. We might see how the coalitions are interacting with all of the \nsupply chains in a more transparent way. \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nI keep hearing the prescription is for 30 days. Some places offer a 90-day \nsupply. Would 30 days be an absolute number, or is there flexibility for how \noften a person gets his or her prescription filled? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThis bill is talking about how to define another class of drugs. We are really \nconcerned with drugs going up in price. The course of therapy being 30 days \nwould  cost  at  least  $40  at  the  wholesale  price.  For  drugs  that  are \n$40 wholesale  and  have  gone  up  10  percent  or  more  in  the  last  year, \nmanufacturers will be subject to the law and have to start reporting on those \ndrugs.  \n \nThis is not about how much supply a patient gets; it is a way to define another \ngroup of drugs, if it costs enough to make a difference and is going up in price. \n \nMR. GOLD: \nAmericans should not pay the highest drug costs in the Nation. What is behind \nthe  cost  for  certain  drugs  or  the  increase  in  price  by  a  certain  amount? \nTypically, research and development are not the most expensive cost of a drug. \n \n \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \nMS. HOLMES: \nThe Culinary Health Fund provides health benefits to members of the Culinary \nWorkers Union and their dependents. A critical priority for us is providing quality \nand  affordable  health  care,  including  prescription  drugs.  By  requiring \ntransparency reporting from critical market participants in the drug supply chain, \npolicy makers will be able to see these participants, roll in drug prices and \nidentify the cost drivers. This reporting will ensure policy makers in the State \nmake data-driven decisions and end finger-pointing of who is to blame for the \nincreases in drug prices. \n \nYITZEL HERRERA: \nI am here in support of this bill. When I lost my job, the pharmacist told me I \nshould get a prescription savings club card. I heard about the cost of drugs \ngoing up, and I would not be able to afford them anymore. \n \nMS. LOCKARD: \nI am representing the Retired Public Employees of Nevada. We support this bill. \nOur seniors are hurting, and any help we can get with the pharmacy and drug \ncosts will help. \n \nPHILIP MALINAS: \nI am a Reno psychiatrist. I see my patients struggle to pay for the medications I \nprescribe for them. My patients see mysterious changes in price which always \nhappen with no warning or advance notice to my patients. \n \nMS. FALGOUT: \nI have submitted testimony (Exhibit AC) on behalf of Battle Born Progress in \nsupport of S.B. 380. \n \nBILL HEAD (Pharmaceutical Care Management Association): \nWe oppose this bill. We are mostly concerned with the terms of what is being \nrequired to report. Having the information posted publically can be hindering. \nStates  have  done  an  excellent  job  managing  the  proprietary  information  for \ndrugs and want to continue that as this expands the reporting requirements. \nThere is a need for public consumption. The Federal Trade Commission has \nwarned that giving out information that allows entities within the supply chain \nto see what others are charging, either directly or through reverse engineering \ndata, can actually result in higher drug costs.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \nMS. LISEC: \nI have submitted PhRMA opposition (Exhibit AD) to S.B. 380. \n \nLEAH LINDAHL (Healthcare Distribution Alliance): \nI have submitted my opposition (Exhibit AE) to S.B. 380. \n \nMS. SASSO: \nThe Health Services Coalition is neutral on S.B. 380. This will provide policy \nmakers  with  the  information  needed  to  make  better  decisions  to  support \npatients  in  the  community  who  struggle  with  the  affordability  of  their \nmedications. \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nWe will close the hearing on S.B. 380. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRemainder of page intentionally left blank; signature page to follow.   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 27 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nHearing nothing further, I will adjourn the meeting at 7:34 p.m. \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nDiane Rea, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 28 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nBegins \nExhibit \nBill   on  Witness / Entity  Description \nLetter \nPage \n  A  1    Agenda \nS.B. 5  B  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 40  C  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 61  D  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 96  E  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 158  F  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 175  G  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 188  H  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 205  I  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 211  J  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 251  K  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 305  L  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 379  M  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nA.B. 62  N  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 396  O  1  Senator Fabian Donate Testimony \nTrevor Douglass / \nS.B. 396  P  1  Prescription Drug  Presentation \nConsortium \nBeth Slamowitz / \nS.B. 396  Q  1  Department of Health  Written Remarks \nand Human Services \nS.B. 396  R  1  Senator Fabian Donate Conceptual Amendment \nAmber Falgout / Battle \nS.B. 396  S  1  Testimony \nBorn Progress \nS.B. 201  T  1  Senator Fabian Donate Testimony \nBeth Slamowitz / \nS.B. 201  U  1  Nevada Department of Written Remarks \nHealth and Human \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 29 \n \nServices \nS.B. 201  V  1  Senator Fabian Donate Conceptual Amendment \nAsher Lisec / \nPharmaceutical \nS.B. 201  W  1  Research and  Statement in Opposition \nManufacturers of \nAmerica \nTalia Pellegrino / \nTestimony for Senator \nS.B. 364  X  1  Access to Healthcare \nMelanie Scheible \nNetwork  \nAmber Falgout / Battle \nS.B. 364  Y  1  Statement of Support \nBorn Progress \nCaroline Mello \nS.B. 364  Z  1  Roberson / NARAL  Statement of Support \nPro-Choice Nevada \nS.B. 380  AA  1  Senator Julia Ratti  Conceptual Amendment \nBeth Slamowitz / \nS.B. 380  AB  1  Department of Health  Written Remarks \nand Human Services \nAmber Falgout / Battle \nS.B. 380  AC  1  Statement of Support \nBorn Progress \nAsher Lisec / \nPharmaceutical \nS.B. 380  AD  1  Research and  Statement in Opposition \nManufacturers of \nAmerica \nLeah Lindahl / \nS.B. 380  AE  1  Healthcare Distribution Testimony \nAlliance \n ", "59": "\nMINUTES OF THE \nSENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n \nEighty-first Session \nApril 8, 2021 \n \n \nThe  Senate  Committee  on  Health  and  Human  Services  was  called  to  order  by \nChair Julia Ratti at 3:37 p.m. on Thursday, April 8, 2021, Online.

(BDR 38-705) \n \nMS. COMLOSSY: \nI will read the summary of the bill and the amendments from the work session \ndocument (Exhibit C). \n \nJOANNA JACOB (Clark County): \nWe worked in collaboration with the State and Washoe County on this measure. \nThe biggest amendment deletes the sections in the bill that would have provided \nfor  the  involuntary  commitment  process.  This  is  because  the  receiving  centers \nproposed  in  the  bill  are  permissive.  The  sections  proposed  on  involuntary \ncommitment need some additional work. We are going to continue to work on that \nissue together during the Interim.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nSection 3 proposes moving the “receiving center” definition to Nevada Revised \nStatutes (NRS) 424 from NRS 432A, which is more the foster care section of the \nlaw. \n \nSection 6, subsection 2, paragraph (a) considers alternative placements in addition \nto the receiving center. There is a great deal of work going on by child welfare \nagencies on the issue of handling cases of children experiencing commercial and \nsexual  exploitation.  There  is  green  language  throughout  where  we  have  added \nalternative placements. \n \nThere  are  deletions  to  section  30  of  the  original  bill  as  to  the  involuntary \ncommitment process. The changes to NRS 432C.010 in the newly renumbered \nsection 16 were proposed to work on our screening process for children who are \nvictims of commercial sexual exploitation. The amendments were proposed to give \nus more flexibility. \n \nWe were looking to see if we could leverage any federal dollars or available funding \nto help assist child welfare agencies with the shift away from juvenile justice. \nLanguage in the amendment was designed to align processes allowing us to build, \nwhere available, access to federal Title IV-E of the Social Security Act funding. \n \nThe change at the end of the bill delays the implementation date where we relocate \nthe responsibility from the juvenile justice system to our child welfare agencies. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nFlexibility in creating receiving centers as a concept may be a tool we want to use. \nGreater flexibility to use some of the existing tools and momentum in the child \nwelfare movement will better connect us to Title IV-E funds as a funding source \nalong with Medicaid and local funding. It is about ensuring we get it right on \nTitle IV-E funding because this bill is about taking children out of the juvenile justice \nsystem and getting them into the child welfare system if they have been victims of \nsexual exploitation. \n \nMS. JACOB: \nWe are looking for all available funding sources.  \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nI am curious about the removal of the involuntary commitment provisions starting \nwith section 18. Can you speak to why that has been struck out? \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nBRIGID DUFFY (Clark County Office of the District Attorney): \nI made the determination to support pulling those sections of the bill at this time \nbecause work needs to go into those sections as far as getting a consensus. There \nwas some opposition during the hearing on the bill from community stakeholders \nwith the original language. If we get the date pushed out to 2023, we could come \ntogether during the Interim and create a solid involuntary commitment that protects \nthe child’s due process rights and allows for review hearings. \n \nFor the most part, this was a timing issue. If the bill passes and the date is pushed \nout to 2023, we should get this done during the Interim and make a solid plan. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWhat is the report pursuant to NRS 432C.110 in the newly renumbered section 17, \nsubsection 1, paragraph (c)? This seems like a significant expansion of an agency’s \nresponsibilities. \n \nMS. JACOB: \nThe report under NRS 432C.110 is when we receive outside reports of any time \nany person knows or has reasonable cause to believe a child is possibly the victim \nof commercial sexual exploitation. This is upon referral from outside of our child \nwelfare agency, and the report is given to our child welfare agency. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nI just wanted to make sure this was not a general report of abuse or neglect; that it \nwas more specific, and we were not doing a massive expansion. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nDuring  the  hearing  on  S.B.  274,  I  expressed  my  concerns  around  the  term \n“receiving center” and reiterate those concerns. Language matters, and what is \nimportant is that we take the model, not necessarily having to keep the name. I \nencourage  the  sponsors  to  continue  thinking  about  something  more \nperson-centered. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will entertain a motion on S.B. 274. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN MOVED TO AMEND AND DO PASS AS AMENDED \nS.B. 274. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the work session on S.B. 274 and open the work session on S.B. 275. \n \nSENATE  BILL  275:  Revises  provisions  relating  to  the  human  immunodeficiency \nvirus.

We have not had any discussion about \nthis. \n \nI have continued concerns about the change in burden on testing for our first \nresponders.

COMLOSSY: \nI will read the summary of the bill and the amendments from the work session \ndocument (Exhibit J). \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThere were significant conversations following the hearing on S.B. 380, and there \nis a lengthy amendment. \n \nBETH SLAMOWITZ (Senior Policy Advisor on Pharmacy, Department of Health and \nHuman Services): \nUnder the general amendment, there is an additional definition for rebate. \n \nSection 5 has been deleted in its entirety. \n \nIn section 6, subsection 2, paragraph (b), the number of units has been redefined \nas volume in wholesale acquisition cost units. Paragraph (f) adds the aggregate \ntotal amount of rebates and deletes the statement of discounts and other price \nconcessions. Paragraph (h) adds the term aggregate and deletes the total amount \nof rebates and discounts, dispensing fees and other fees. \n \nSections 7 and 8 were removed in their entirety. \n \nSection 10 remained the same as the original conceptual amendment heard during \nthe hearing on April 6. \n \nSection 11 remained the same as the original conceptual amendment heard during \nthe hearing on April 6. There were formatting changes only. \n \nSection 13, subsection 2, paragraph (a) was removed. The units were defined in \nsubsection  2,  paragraphs  (b)  and  (c)  as  wholesale  acquisition  cost  units. \nParagraphs (d) and (e) were removed; paragraph (f) adds the term aggregate in \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nterms of aggregate amount of all rebates and deletes discounts and other price \nconcessions.  Paragraphs  (k),  (l),  (m)  and  (n)  add  the  term  aggregate. \nParagraphs (p), (q), (r) and (s) were removed.  \n \nSection  16,  subsection  5  was  deleted  due  to  the  deletion  of  section  5,  and \nsubsection 12 was deleted due to section 7 being deleted. \n \nMs. Comlossy mentioned the changes to section 18 not noted in this amendment. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe  missed  an  amendment  attached  to  the  work  session  document,  Exhibit  J, \nwhere  the  fees  were  set  at  $30,000,  a  significant  raise  from  the  fees  in  the \nexisting law of $5,000. This amendment would take it back to $5,000. \n \nEverything Ms. Slamowitz went through shows a significant scaling back of the bill \nwhile leaving in some important concepts. These include expanding to the drugs of \nsignificant cost at $40 per wholesale acquisition price and 10 percent increase that \nyear so we could do additional transparency work on another class of drugs and \ncontinue to advance what we know as a State about how drug pricing is changing. \nIt does include retail pharmacy benefit managers (RPBMs) and wholesalers with \nsome transparency requirements. \n \nThe  transparency  requirements  are  more  modest  and  have  less  registration \nrequirements.  It  removes  insurers.  We  crosswalked  with  the  all-payer  claims \ndatabase (APCD) bill that was heard, so we will initially get that information from \nthe APCD. If that does not turn out to be the case as we are standing up this new \nsystem, we would come back in a subsequent session to have that conversation. It \nappears  the  transparency  requirements  of  the  APCD  make  the  insurance \nrequirements in this bill unnecessary. \n \nIt will make it less expensive as the fiscal notes were significant. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nSection 10 changes which medications now have to be reported; I read it as this is \nall drugs that meet those two triggers—a cost of more than $40 and an increase by \n10 percent in a year. Is that correct? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe  law  stays  the  same  for  asthma  and  diabetes  drugs.  When  I  speak  of  an \nadditional class, I should say an additional group of drugs. Instead of being defined \nby disease, those drugs would be defined by the wholesale acquisition cost and the \nincrease of 10 percent in a year. The bill started out with all drugs and narrowed \ndown to those. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nDo we know how many reports are expected? \n \nMS. SLAMOWITZ: \nIt is difficult to determine. The list of drugs we look at will be determined by the \nwholesale acquisition cost which must be more than $40 for a course of therapy; \nsection 10, subsection 1, paragraphs (a) and (b) define a course of therapy. There \nmust also be a 10 percent increase over one year or twice the net 10 percent \nincrease over two years. It will significantly increase the number of manufacturers \nwe  will  receive  reports  from.  In  addition,  the  bill  adds  wholesalers  as  well  as \nRPBMs, so we will have three reporting groups: wholesalers, manufacturers and \nRPBMs. \n \nWe were looking at potentially double to triple the amount of reports, but it will be \ndifficult  until  we  go  through  the  first  reporting  cycle  to  see  what  comes  in. \nObviously, prices change daily, if not hourly. That list may look different today than \nit will look a month from now. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWhere did you say the definition of a course of therapy was? \n \nMS. SLAMOWITZ: \nIn section 10, subsection 1, paragraphs (a) and (b) define a course of therapy as \neither the recommended daily dosage units of a prescription to its prescribing label \nas approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for 30 days or the \nrecommended daily dosage units of a prescription drug pursuant to its prescribing \nlabel as approved by the FDA for a normal course of treatment that is less than \n30 days. So a bottle of eye drops might not be a 30-day supply, it might be a \n5-day supply. What the FDA label calls for would be a course of therapy. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nFor instance, it may be an antibiotic you take for a week. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nMS. SLAMOWITZ: \nYes, it would be based on what the FDA has approved as far as the indication and \nthe course of treatment whether it be once a day or twice a day for 10 or 14 days. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI am equating that to someone who is an asthmatic who takes steroids. If you have \na bad asthma attack in February and another one in July, the course of therapy \nwould be whenever they prescribe those steroids to help expand the lungs. Is that \ncorrect? \n \nMS. SLAMOWITZ: \nYes. The course of therapy would be determined by the package label or insert. \nPeople take steroids for many indications. If the normal course of therapy for a \nparticular steroid states you should take it twice a day, we would look at what is \nrequired in terms of a 30-day supply of that particular medication, if it falls into the \npricing parameters. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will entertain a motion on S.B. 380. \n \nSENATOR  HARRIS  MOVED  TO  AMEND  AND  DO  PASS  AS  AMENDED \nS.B. 380. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE  MOTION  CARRIED.  (SENATORS  HARDY  AND  KIECKHEFER  VOTED \nNO.) \n \n* * * * * \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nI do not see what is going to be a deluge of data to the State driving cost savings \nto patients. Have we seen that through data we are already collecting on asthma \nand diabetes medications? Other bills not to be processed that came out of the \nInterim study may have had direct patient impact. I am not sure where our goals \nare on this. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nERIC ROBBINS (COUNSEL): \nSection 10 of the amendment in the work session document, Exhibit J, appeared to \ndelete the existing language about the list of drugs essential for treating asthma \nand diabetes and replaced that with the new criteria. Chair Ratti, you mentioned it \nwas your impression you thought we kept the asthma and diabetes language. Can I \nget clarification on the Committee’s intent? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nOur intent is to keep the asthma and diabetes language. \n \nMS. SLAMOWITZ: \nAsthma and diabetes language would be cast with the same net, so that is why the \nfirst statement under section 10, subsection 1 was deleted. This is looking at the \nentire universe of drugs and basing the requirements of the list on cost versus \nindication.  The  diabetes  and  asthma  medications  that  fall  under  those  cost \nrequirements would be included on this list. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIf they do not cost $40 or more for the wholesale acquisition price or have not \ngone up by 10 percent, would we not require the reporting in that year? \n \nMS. SLAMOWITZ: \nThe requirements that exist in legislation where we use the Consumer Price Index \n(CPI) would be similar. The same drugs would not fall on the list as they would fall \nunder the requirements for the $40 wholesale acquisition cost and the 10 percent \nincrease. It is a cleaner way to look at the cost of the drug than the CPI because \nthe CPI does not take into account all consumers. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThat  was  my  misunderstanding,  Mr.  Robbins;  the  way  it  is  written  in  the \namendment is the intent. \n \nI will close the work session on S.B. 380 and open the work session on S.B. 391. \n \nSENATE BILL 391: Revises provisions relating to dentistry. (BDR 40-455) \n \nMS. COMLOSSY: \nI will read the summary of the bill and the amendments from the work session \ndocument (Exhibit K). \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe amendment received after the hearing on April 1 ensures the positions relating \nto oral health were clearly defined and aligned with the status of the dental health \nofficers similarly to the status of chief medical officer. For our dental hygienists, \nthe language allows them to have outside work. I would like to note our dental \nhygienist works part time for the State, and statute disallows her from having \nadditional work outside of her part-time job with the State. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWe have three amendments and propose to adopt all three? \n \nMS. COMLOSSY: \nIt is the intent to adopt all three as they are each separate and distinct. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will entertain a motion on S.B. 391. \n \nSENATOR  HARDY  MOVED  TO  AMEND  AND  DO  PASS  AS  AMENDED \nS.B. 391. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the work session on S.B. 391 and open the work session on S.B. 396. \n \nSENATE BILL 396: Revises provisions relating to the purchasing of prescription \ndrugs. (BDR 38-443) \n \nMS. COMLOSSY: \nI will read the summary of the bill and the amendments from the work session \ndocument (Exhibit L). \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe had a two-line conceptual amendment to the bill, and there was confusion \nabout which part of NRS we were getting to. I asked Mr. Robbins to do Proposed \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nAmendment 3226 which is part of the work session document, Exhibit L. This \nshould give greater clarity to removing the barriers to the different versions of \ncoalitions partnering with each other to increase the purchasing leverage when it \ncomes to pharmaceuticals. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe pieces incorporated into section 1 of the amendment are what we said were \nallowed by a different piece of statute, and the provisions in section 3.3 are what \nwe need to do. Is this correct? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI asked Ms. Slamowitz, Ms. Comlossy, Mr. Robbins and Senator Donate to make \nsure  we  were  all  talking  about  the  same  thing.  This  is  the  result  of  that \nconversation. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nI was under the impression the State could enter into collaborative agreements with \nother states and territories and not need that piece of the proposed bill. \n \nMS. SLAMOWITZ: \nWhen  we  discussed  this,  we  realized  the  express  authority  is  there  for  public \nentities within the State to collaborate with other public entities within as well as \noutside the State. The reason for the amendment within section 3.3 is to allow \nthose public entities to collaborate with other private entities. \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nSection 1 says the same thing as section 3.3 but applies to Medicaid. There are \nspecific  statutes  governing  the  purchase  of  prescription  drugs  by  Medicaid.  If \nMedicaid wanted to participate, we would have to go into those statutes. This is a \nconforming  change  to  what  is  in  section  3.3.  The  change  from  the  existing \nlanguage in section 1 states we are allowing them to collaborate with one or more \npublic or private entities in Nevada, the District of Columbia and other states and \nterritories.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nPart of our intent is to save people money. Is this going to save patients and \nMedicaid money? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe testimony from Dr. Trevor Douglass during the hearing on the bill shows they \nare getting to a point where they have enough lives to have leverage in purchasing. \nThey are starting to see this turning into a reduction in the cost of pharmaceuticals \nto the members of the coalition. If Medicaid was a member of the coalition and \ncould pay less for each of those pharmaceuticals, the assumption is it will lower \nthe  cost  for  that  Medicaid  recipient  or  increase  the  amount  of  benefits  that \nMedicaid recipients can get because there is more money in the Medicaid pool. \n \nIf it is cheaper for these agencies to buy prescription drugs, then it should result in \na  lower  cost  for  the  end  user.  Because  we  are  talking  about  insurance  plans, \nwhether it ends up being a lower cost on that drug or a lower deductible, or the \ngeneral cost of their health insurance lowers, that is the idea. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI did not hear that the patient was going to save money. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSince there is no profit motive for public agencies, they will either save money or \nget more services because it does go back into the plan. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThe  more  the  coalitions  grow,  the  more  the  savings  could  be  for  those  who \nparticipate. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nI would suggest that Dr. Douglass’s primary testimony was that the coalitions save \nmost of their money by addressing rebates and other issues we are not addressing \nin this bill. \n \nMS. SLAMOWITZ: \nI would like to clarify that Dr. Douglass stated the coalitions negotiate additional \nrebates,  and  this  is  how  purchasers  save  money  on  drugs.  They  have  those \nnegotiations with the manufacturers. \n \nFor Medicaid, we have statutory rebates that are federal rebates, and then we have \nsupplemental rebates we negotiate with the manufacturers to further lower the \ncost of those drugs. The preferred drug list is created off placement based on those \nnegotiations. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nThe driving force—the more lives to leverage with those manufacturers—creates \nthat rebate pool to lower the cost of drugs for your entire membership. Those \nrebates are most important. \n \nWithin the State, there is expressed authority that if Medicaid wanted to join an \nentity  outside  the  State  with  the  Northwest  Prescription  Drug  Consortium,  it \nalready has a solution for managed care organizations (MCOs). It does not have a \nsolution for fee-for-service since we have both in the State. There is no opportunity \nfor Medicaid to join the Northwest Prescription Drug Consortium because of that. \nWe could look at collectively working with other entities within the State. \n \nOftentimes, when Medicaid gets pulled into it, it gets muddy because of the federal \nrequirements. The intent of this bill is to allow other public and private entities to \nwork cooperatively to reduce the cost of drugs to leverage those rebates through \nnegotiations based on the increased number of participants. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nDr. Douglass indicated coalitions captured 100 percent of that rebate minus a fixed \nadministrative cost for the RPBM administration. He had indicated that was where \na primary piece of their savings came from. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will entertain a motion on S.B. 396. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN MOVED TO AMEND AND DO PASS AS AMENDED \nS.B. 396. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the work session on S.B. 396 and open the work session on S.B. 376. \n \nSENATE BILL 376: Revises provisions relating to child welfare.

COMLOSSY: \nI will read the summary of the bill and the amendments from the work session \ndocument (Exhibit M). \n \nKENDRA BERTSCHY (Public Defender's Office, Washoe County): \nThe intention of the amendment is to provide clarification on what we should do \nwith  the  different  dispositions.  Only  the  dispositions  substantiated  are  those \nreported to the Central Repository for Nevada Records of Criminal History. When \nemployers request records to see what is substantiated, we want to ensure only \nsubstantiated dispositions released to those employers. \n \nIn addition, an amendment clarifies three other forms of disposition, other than the \nsubstantiated, have the same legal affect. We do not want to run into an issue in \nthe future where someone thinks having one of the other dispositions is makes it \nworse for his or her dependency case. \n \nSENATOR JAMES OHRENSCHALL (Senatorial District No. 21): \nI consider the amendments friendly and believe they improve the bill. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will entertain a motion on S.B. 376. \n \nSENATOR  HARDY  MOVED  TO  AMEND  AND  DO  PASS  AS  AMENDED \nS.B. 376. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the work session on S.B. 376. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nI will open the hearing on S.B. 390. \n \nSENATE BILL 390: Provides for the establishment of a statewide suicide prevention \nand mental health crisis hotline. (BDR 39-635) \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nSENATOR JULIA RATTI (Senatorial District No. 13): \nBoth  components  in  this  bill  have  the  opportunity  to  move  the  needle  in  our \nbehavioral health and substance use disorder space. Two things have happened \nrecently that we have been working a long time to ensure. The first is that in \nJanuary, the 988 number, a project that many behavioral health advocates have \nput hours into developing across the Nation, was approved and ready to go at the \nnational level. The 988 number becomes a behavioral health hotline based on our \nNational Suicide Prevention Lifeline similar to 911, after being under development \nfor many years. The federal regulatory process is done, and it us up to us as a \nState to implement it. \n \nThe next component has taken a significant amount of work and many hands to \nmake the labor light. Nevada was significantly impacted by the opioid crisis. People \non  this  Committee,  former  and  current  Governors,  and  former  and  current \nAttorneys General, have put time and energy into addressing the impact of the \nopioid epidemic on the State and ensuring those who contributed to that opioid \nepidemic be held accountable. \n \nAARON FORD (Attorney General): \nI am here today to speak about principles, underlying remediation and the status of \nthe opioid litigation as we discuss S.B. 390. \n \nThe Bureau of Consumer Protection, in conjunction with an outside contingency \ncounsel hired as a result of Governor Steve Sisolak’s declaration of findings on \nJanuary 29, 2019, has been working on numerous fronts in Nevada collectively \nknown as the opioids litigation. More than 60 defendants in our litigation help \nremediate  the  harms,  risks  and  effects  of  the  opioid  epidemic  in  Nevada  and \nthroughout our Country. Remediating the harm caused by the influx of opioids into \ncommunities throughout Nevada is paramount. The development of the proposed \namendment (Exhibit N) and the document from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of \nPublic  Health  on  Principles  for  the  Use  of  Funds  From  the  Opioid  Litigation \n(Exhibit O) were used as a guide. \n \nThe Principles for the Use of Funds From the Opioid Litigation, Exhibit O, is a \nconsensus document supported by a number of national organizations such as the \nAmerican Medical Association. The guiding principles are to first, use the funds to \nsupplement rather than supplant existing State spending; second, use funds to \nsupport programs supported by evidence-based interventions; third, use the funds \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nto support investments in youth prevention; fourth, use the funds with a focus on \nracial equity; and fifth, report to the public as to which programs are being funded. \n \nWhile my team and I have been focused on the litigation, the Department of Health \nand Human Services (DHHS) has designed this in a way best able to allocate the \nfunds according to the five principles. The DHHS conducts needs assessments and \nregularly coordinates with stakeholders, treatment providers, Nevada agencies and \nothers to administer funds for a variety of other health issues. \n \nMy team continues to fight on a multitude of litigation fronts. These fronts began \nwith  the  McKinsey & Company  $573  million  settlement  in  the  State’s  opioid \nlitigation currently pending in the Eighth Judicial District Court in Clark County. \nHowever,  the  fronts  also  include  the  national  litigation,  national  settlement \nnegotiations and recent developments in bankruptcy-related matters all related to \nopioids. \n \nMcKinsey & Company  is  a  global  consulting  firm  that  advised  Purdue  Pharma, \namong  others, on “turbocharging” opioid sales, even as the drug  manufacturer \nknew  patients  were  becoming  addicted  to  OxyContin  and  other  opioids. \nMcKinsey & Company agreed to a multistate settlement with attorneys general and \nfellow colleagues from 49 states, 5 territories and the District of Columbia. Nevada \ndid not participate in that settlement for a number of reasons, one of which is that \nNevada considers itself one of the hardest-hit states for the opioid epidemic. We \nhave favorable laws in Nevada that protect our citizens differently than residents of \nother states would have been protected. We would have gotten far less under this \nsettlement had we entered into the multistate settlement than we did going in on \nour own. \n \nNevada  negotiated  its  own  deal  with  McKinsey & Company  and  reached  a \n$45 million  settlement.  This  settlement  does  not  include  cities  and  counties \nbecause  Nevada  does  not  have  the  authority  to  settle  or  sue  on  behalf  of  its \npolitical  subdivisions  for  this  type  of  litigation.  The  lawsuit  the  Office  of  the \nAttorney General is pursuing is purely for damages the State has incurred. It is not \nrepresenting  any  county  or  municipality  in  this  litigation;  it  is  all  State-related \ndamages. The monies we brought in relate to those issues. Several municipalities \nwithin our State have their own litigation happening, and they will be receiving \nfunds when those lawsuits are won. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nAs with all litigation in Nevada and nationally, the Covid-19 pandemic slowed down \nthe progress of the Office of the Attorney General’s case. Despite this, our State \nagencies have continued to cooperate with the Office of the Attorney General to \ncollect discovery, even as most people were working from home. Discovery—a \nprocess in litigation where documents, depositions and things of that nature are \nexchanged between the parties—is an important component and ongoing through \nthis  pandemic.  Some  of  that  discovery  includes  ongoing  document  collection, \nreview  and  production  of  those  documents.  It  also  includes  a  review  of  the \ndefendant’s documents and the filing and arguing of discovery motions before the \nspecial  master  assigned  to  this  case.  We  are  starting  to  move  forward  with \nbeginning depositions which were also delayed due to the pandemic. \n \nWe have filed an amended complaint in this lawsuit naming additional defendants \nand causes of action that bring the total number of defendants in our lawsuit to 61. \nSome  of  these  newly  added  defendants  are  Johnson  and  Johnson;  Janssen; \nNoramco; Actavis; Allergan Finance LLC; Cephalon, Inc.; Watson Laboratories Inc.; \nCVS  TN  Distribution;  Longs  Drugs  Stores;  and  American  Drug  Stores  LLC. \nAdditionally, a second amended complaint contains detailed allegations to support \nthe  Nevada  False  Claims  Act  cause  of  action  as  well  as  additional  allegations \nregarding the conduct of some of the national retail pharmacies. \n \nThere is ongoing national litigation in federal court which is known as multidistrict \nlitigation. Opioid cases that end up being filed or drug into federal court, not in \nNevada’s case, are sent to Ohio for a federal judge to oversee the multidistrict \nlitigation  for  discovery.  That  judge,  Judge  Dan  Aaron  Polster,  has  postponed \nseveral upcoming trial dates. One trial set in West Virginia has a May trial date, and \nit appears that trial will go forward. That trial is against three distributors, not the \n61 defendants we have named. \n \nAlong  with  national  litigation  comes  discussions  around  national  settlement \nnegotiations.  You  may  have  heard  or  read  about  discussions  between  some \ndefendants who have been negotiating with a handful of attorneys general in an \nattempt  to  reach  a  settlement  with  all  states.  McKinsey & Company  was  an \nexample of that. These discussions have been happening for over a year, and from \nwhat has been publicly announced, the following proposals have been discussed. \n \nA $21 billion deal from distributors McKesson, Amerisource Health Services LLC \nand  Cardinal  Health  proposed  payout  over  an  18-year  period  and  an  additional \n$5 billion from Johnson and Johnson. That is one conversation around the national \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nsettlements taking place. While there is no agreement on how this money will be \ndistributed, in my estimation Nevada’s total share would not be enough to address \nor  remediate  the  harms  caused  by  its  opioid  epidemic.  Nevada’s  Office  of  the \nAttorney General is continuing to monitor these discussions, but we are moving \nforward with our own litigation. \n \nThe opioid-related bankruptcies add a new wrinkle to this conversation. Purdue \nPharma, a defendant in our litigation, filed a chapter 11 reorganization under the \nU.S. Bankruptcy Code, and a plan was filed earlier this month. Details described in \nthat plan are being negotiated. On April 21, there will be a hearing in New York \nwhere the bankruptcy court is expected to approve the disclosure statement, the \nvoting procedures and ballots for a deadline to vote on the plan set for July 14. \n \nKey terms of the proposed plan have $4.3 billion currently allocated to claims of \nnonfederal government claims—that is states, cities and counties. That amount of \nmoney will be distributed over a 10-year period and used for opioid abatement \npurposes  only.  The  allocation  amounts  for  the  states,  including  the  cities  and \ncounties, have not yet been determined. Cities, counties and states in which they \nare located will have conversations around ways to divide the money, and Nevada \nis no different in that regard. \n \nThe  Office  of  the  Attorney  General  will  continue  to  participate  in  a  creditors \ncommittee before the bankruptcy court for the purposes of staying abreast and \npursuing our ends in bankruptcy court. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nIf every case fell our way and things went well for Nevada on all of these cases, \ncan you give us a sense of scale of the estimated dollars? \n \nATTORNEY GENERAL FORD: \nWe have experts who are working on the report and discovery process and are not \nprepared to detail the exact numbers until the report has been released. I will say \nthat it is in the billions. We need to let the experts continue to work on the report. \n \nSENATOR RATTI:  \nYou  referred  to  some  cases  taking  place  this  month  and  a  trial  for  the \nthree distributors scheduled in May. Do you have an idea of how long it will take \nfor Nevada, and the Nation, to make its way through all of this litigation? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \nATTORNEY GENERAL FORD: \nWe had anticipated a trial date for Nevada’s litigation for early this year. We should \nhave been in January, but the Covid-19 pandemic pushed it back. We are looking \nat going to trial possibly mid-year 2022, depending on what the trial schedule looks \nlike in that regard. Our trial could take months. At this juncture, we anticipate we \nwill have some resolution within the next two years in our State case where we \nhave our 61 defendants who have been sued. \n \nThe bankruptcy cases are a little more difficult for us to estimate. Purdue Pharma \nand  the  posture  of  bankruptcy  cases  make  us  think  differently  about  how  we \nengage with our fellow attorneys general and municipalities within the State. The \nbankruptcy  courts  are  different  relative  to  the  litigation  components.  The \nreorganization plan put out recently will have movement on it on April 21 with \nballots  going  out  in  July.  This  means  they  are  moving  toward  some  level  of \nfinalization in the Purdue Pharma bankruptcy case. I would anticipate seeing things \nclose to finality there as it progresses. \n \nI do not know the trial schedule for West Virginia but would anticipate if it begins \nin May, four to five months may be the time frame for those cases. The Oklahoma \ncase took several months before it came to a verdict in favor of Oklahoma against \nJohnson and Johnson 18 months ago. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWhat is the difference between what is part of the State litigation and settlements \nand what local governments are doing on their own? Local governments have been \ndoing some actions independently. In S.B. 390, all of the money collected is being \nsubgranted to the local governments and nonprofits. If they are doing their own \nlitigation, I doubt they are going to subgrant it to us. \n \nATTORNEY GENERAL FORD: \nThe State litigation is purely brought forward on behalf of the State. These are \ncauses of action to Medicaid, for example, that directly relate to State damages. \nWe purposefully did not name any causes of action that would bring in the City of \nReno, Washoe County, Clark County, Las Vegas or Elko. As you have indicated, \nthey have their own pieces of litigation, and their damages are calculated according \nto how their experts have calculated them. I will leave the policy of how the funds \nare distributed to the policy makers. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \nTo the extent there is some overlap, it will take some determination on the policy \nmakers’ part as to how those issues will be addressed. We will be talking to the \nmunicipalities that have their own respective pieces of litigation, some of which are \ncaught up in bankruptcy issues or the multidistrict litigation, to determine how we \ncan work together. As a general matter, every dollar we bring in as the Office of \nthe Attorney General is a State dollar recovered under a lawsuit brought for the \nState, not for any county or municipality. \n \nJESSICA ADAIR (Chief of Staff, Office of the Attorney General): \nWithout getting too far into the bill, that is the wisdom of the amendment. These \nare State dollars. As the distributor of the funds, DHHS can ensure we are not \nsupplanting funds already distributed by the State and local governments. This will \nensure  we  use  that  funding  mechanism  with  the  appropriate  State  and  local \npartnerships, ensuring we are not double-dipping with this funding, and that local \ncounty governments with their own funding are not using State dollars in a way \nthat is inappropriate. \n \nThat is the benefit of DHHS being the distributor and working closely with local \ncounty health boards to ensure that does not happen. In addition to some of the \ncities and counties having their own lawsuits, some tribal entities in the State have \ntheir  own  lawsuits  related  to  opioid  litigation.  That  will  be  another  important \npartnership with State and local governments as we distribute this funding. \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nCan  you  explain  again  about  the  disbursement  of  funds  once  the  cases  are \nresolved, specifically about the communities hardest hit, making sure the dollars \ndistributed are commensurate with what they need to recover? \n \nATTORNEY GENERAL FORD: \nThe intent of this bill is to ensure the distribution of the opioid funds is to help \nabate things that have resulted due to the opioid epidemic. I am confident that \nequity issues will be taken into consideration. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThe proposed amendment, Exhibit N, was submitted on April 8. The first version of \nS.B. 390 came about quickly because the McKinsey & Company settlement with \n$45 million coming to us happened as we were coming into Session. As I started \nto learn more about where we were in the process of the opioid settlement and the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \nbillions of dollars that could be coming to the State, it felt important we develop \nthe legislative framework, knowing we would be in Session. \n \nSince  that  time,  we  have  done  a  significant  amount  of  work  with  DHHS,  the \ncounties and the Office of the Attorney General to develop a framework that makes \nsense. The amendment, Exhibit N, is a much better thought-out document. I am \nworking  collaboratively  on  the  settlement  framework  while  Assemblywoman \nJill Tolles, Assembly District No. 25, is working on reconstituting something similar \nto the opioid task force we used to have. We are broadening it as we understand \nwhile opioids have been a significant focus, all of the people who work within \nsubstance abuse disorder will tell you the shift is moving more toward heroin and \nmultiuse drugs. We need to have the broader conversation about substance use \ndisorder and prevention. \n \nThe proposed amendment, Exhibit N, is the product of the working group that \ncollaboratively worked to establish the best way to accomplish this. \n \nA significant amount of money is coming our way. Immediately, there will be a lot \nof people with many ideas on how we can spend this money. Because most of the \nsettlements will have some restricting language about how they can be used, we \nneed to make sure we are using the money in the way intended. A significant \nquantitative and qualitative needs assessment that is the first step. It is important \nthe analysis be based on meaningful data about impact. \n \nIn addition to data, analytics and things we will need to bring together, section 9, \nsubsection 1, paragraph (a) of the proposed amendment, Exhibit N, states that: \n \nThe  needs  assessment  shall  include  a  focus  on  health  equity  and \nidentifying  disparities  across  all  racial  and  ethnic  populations, \ngeographic  regions,  and  specific  populations  including  veterans, \npregnant women and parents with dependent children, LGBTQ, youth, \nand  individuals  or  families  involved  in  the  criminal  justice,  juvenile \njustice, and child welfare systems. \n \nAn awakening in this Country has led us to understand that Covid-19 has shone a \nlight on when we have bad things happen, such as an opioid epidemic. The impact \nto  subpopulations  is  not  the  same.  As  we  are  understanding  the  impact  to \neveryone, we want to understand the disparate impact to certain populations. That \nis built in up front in the needs assessment. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 27 \n \nSection  9,  subsection  1,  paragraphs  (b)  and  (c)  speak  to  taking  that  needs \nassessment and establishing Statewide priorities based on that needs assessment. \nThis will look at available data, the analysis of the disparate impact on communities \nof color, community stakeholder input and engagement consultation with subject \nmatter experts as they are the people who focus in this area. This is the process to \nmoving toward these priorities. We are making sure there is outreach to groups \nwho are impacted by the opioid crisis including those listed in paragraph (c). \n \nWe  could  not  name  the  substance  use  task  force  Assemblywoman  Tolles  is \nworking on because it is not yet in the law. If the timing works at the end of \nSession, we will amend this bill to add that task force as it is the intent that the \ntask force is working on some of this and can share the information it has from a \nbroader lens. \n \nSection 9, subsection 2 states what will be done at the conclusion of the needs \nassessment to work together to develop a plan for funding. The lawsuits are on the \nimpact to the State. In reality, every individual lives in a neighborhood, in a city, in \na county, in a state. When we work collaboratively with both the county and the \nState looking at their respective resources, we can effect a better impact. \n \nShould  the  county  have  the  resources  from  its  lawsuit  to  build  a  transitional \nhousing  property  and  the  State  puts  some  of  these  dollars  into  Medicaid  to \nleverage the services to be provided in that facility, you might see the two partners \ncollaborating in that way to alleviate one of the significant impacts of the opioid \nepidemic: a dramatic increase in homelessness. \n \nThe intent of section 9, subsection 2, paragraph (b) is that the State can keep the \nmoney and distribute it to State items and also subgrant it if that makes sense. We \nwill continue to work on this to ensure we have that language as tight as possible. \nThe State may also use up to 8 percent to manage administrative expenses or \nother indirect costs. \n \nThose wishing to apply for this money will need to have understood the needs \nassessment,  know  the  priorities  and  know  they  are  meeting  those  priorities. \nRequired reporting will be sent to the Governor, the Office of the Attorney General, \nregional  behavioral  health  boards,  directors,  Legislative  Counsel  Bureau,  Interim \nCommittees and the Legislature. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 28 \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nWould prevention programs qualify? We know that families, particularly students, \nwho live in a household where opioids are prevalent have been touched by this \ncrisis. Their learning has been truncated, and socially, there are a number of things \nthey cannot do. Is there any way for us to talk about prevention? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nEach settlement will come with its own restrictions baked into the language. That \nis the first piece; the second would be the data and needs assessment. \n \nMS. ADAIR: \nWe need to attack this epidemic at every point from prevention to remediation, \nwhere  people  are  currently  experiencing  problems,  to  wraparound  supports  for \nfamilies. Attorney General Ford  mentioned a document earlier published by the \nJohns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Exhibit O, and those guiding \nprinciples. Those principles are to spend money to save lives, use evidence to guide \nspending, invest in youth prevention, focus on racial equity and develop a fair and \ntransparent process for deciding where to spend the funding. \n \nWhen it comes to State-specific settlements, the Office of the Attorney General \ngets the opportunity to guide the development of those settlement terms. That is \nanother benefit to a State settlement versus a national multistate settlement where \nwe have to work with everyone to come up with that settlement agreement. \n \nPrevention  is  an  important  principle  and  should  be  something  this  Committee \nshould ensure is in the text of the bill to codify that. \n \nSTEPHANIE WOODARD, PSY.D. (Senior Advisor on Behavioral Health, Division of Public \nand Behavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services): \nPrevention is one of the five primary guides used to develop this section of the \nlegislation. In section 9, subsection 2, paragraph (a), Exhibit N, see “Plans must \ninclude strategies to address overdose prevention, disparities in access to care, and \nyouth prevention.” We do not want to be overly prescriptive in what needs to be in \nall of the plans driven by the needs assessment and community level outreach. We \ndid want to ensure all of the plans addressed at least those three primary issues. \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nThe  other  issue  is  cultural  competency.  The  money  will  come  with  its  own \nrequirements,  but  to  the  extent  possible,  the  State  would  make  sure  that \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 29 \n \norganizations of people who are participating in this have some level of cultural \ncompetency; otherwise, it will not work, especially in Black, Indigenous and People \nof Color (BIPOC) communities or in rural and frontier communities. You are talking \nabout different cultures where people understand things differently, talk differently \nand  have  someone  who  has  similar  lived  experience  or  understands  the  lived \nexperiences of other cultures. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nWe made sure the analysis talked about inequities and built in engagement for a \nbroad and diverse group of individuals, including those with lived experience. I do \nnot know if we have pulled in cultural competency as part of the plan, but we can \neasily do that. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nI am trying to understand the process for distributing the money. The way I read \nsection 9, subsection 2, the State and different local government agencies and \ntribes may develop plans following the needs assessments. Is it a competitive grant \nprocess to fund them? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThe  needs  assessment  would  be  performed  and  the  plan  created,  and  then \nsection 9, subsection 1, paragraph (g), subparagraphs (1), (2) and (3), Exhibit N, \nexplain this process. \n \nThe idea is the needs assessment develops the plan, the plan performs the granting \nas well as the ongoing living work that comes out of the substance use task force. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nI am confused by what the language in section 9, subsection 2, paragraph (a), \nExhibit N, says about the establishment of the process to allocate the funding for \nthe priorities and projects. \n \nDR. WOODARD: \nWe worked closely with the counties to find a way to develop equitable distribution \nof these funds while the State has the ability to retain some of these funds for \nstatewide  programming.  They  are  not  competitive  grants  based  on  population \nand/or impact to those direct communities in addition to what we would consider a \nbase. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 30 \n \nWe heard earlier these dollars may not come in all at once. They will likely come in \na staggered fashion, and some of the settlements may actually be protracted over \nthe course of several years. Not knowing how much money we may have to use, \nthis seemed like the best way to move forward depending on how much money is \nin the account, what is determined for investments and what is determined to be \ndistributed to the communities. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWe have the Fund for a Healthy Nevada. I worry creating the Nevada Fund for \nHealthy Communities would have us duplicating our efforts. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThe original intent was all capital, so it was just going to be the healthy Nevada \nfund capital account. Part of the premise of the bill is that we have the internal \ncapacity  in  terms  of  grant  allocation  and  distribution.  For  things  we  do  on  a \nStatewide impact, we either collaborate with the counties or subgrant to counties \nand  nonprofits  with  our  Behavioral  Health  Block  Grants.  The  State  Health  and \nHuman Services workforce is a combination of people who facilitate the work of \nother people and some who do direct services. \n \nPhilosophically, the concept is more the flow through and facilitating the work of \npeople because every individual lives in a neighborhood, in a city, in a county, in a \nstate. If there are concerns around that, we can strengthen the language to say the \nState can consider its own needs in addition to the needs of the counties and come \nup with the correct name for the fund. \n \nDR. WOODARD: \nTo Senator Kieckhefer’s earlier question, we will be requiring counties and tribes \nthat  receive  opioid  recoveries  to  inform  us  and  ensure  it  is  incorporated  in \ndeveloping and improving their plans. We want those plans to be updated no less \nthan  every  three  years  knowing  we  may  be  having  dollars  distributed  for  a \nconsiderable period of time. \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nThere is not enough diversity to comment on the things that need to happen in \nvarious communities by those determining who will receive the grant and how \nmuch they will receive. Representation matters to the extent possible to make sure \nit is representative of county to county, state to state; what does that look like? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 31 \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThat is woven well within the document. We can take another look at it from the \ndecision-making lines and ensure we are checking all of the boxes. \n \nI will move on to the second part of this bill. We now have the final approval on the \nestablishment  of  the  988  national  suicide  prevention  and  mental  health  crisis \nhotline. Part of the continuum of care for behavioral health and substance use \ndisorder is a focus on crisis and what kind of a response individuals in crisis need. \n \nToday when people are in crisis, they are most likely to call 911 and get the \noperator who will ask them if the call is for police, fire or medical. If you are in a \nbehavioral health or substance use crisis, often those are not the correct questions. \nThis  is  a  national  movement  to  divert  behavioral  health  crisis  calls  out  of  the \n911system and more appropriately received by a behavioral health crisis system \nbuilt off the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline model. \n \nDR. WOODARD: \nI will be sharing a slide presentation on the 988 line (Exhibit P). There is a specific \nsection in the bill that addresses the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline which will \nsoon  be  known  as  the  three-digit  number  988.  National  guidelines  have  been \ndeveloped for a coordinated crisis continuum of care. Essentially, this coordinated \ncrisis system of care ensures when individuals are in crisis, he or she has someone \nto talk to, someone to respond to them, somewhere to go, and the services and \nsupports provided are based on best practices. These guidelines have been the \nfoundation of the work Nevada has undergone Statewide and regionally over the \npast three years. \n \nSlide 2 of the presentation, Exhibit O, explains 988. In 2020, the Lifeline nationally \nfielded nearly 2.4 million calls. Nevada’s lifeline had 83,000 contacts in 2019. Over \n19,000 of those contacts were from Nevada, and 9,000 of those contacts were \ntext messages from youth under the age of 18. These crisis calls and texts were \nfrom  all  over  the  State:  25  percent  from  Washoe  County,  31 percent  from \nClark County, 18 percent from the rural counties and 26 percent of the calls from \nunknown locations; but from Nevada. \n \nWith an easy-to-remember and dialed number like 988, the lifeline hopes to reach \nmany more individuals in emotional crisis. By July 2022 when people have an \nurgent mental health need, they will call 988. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 32 \n \nSlide 3 covers the 988 call projections. In order for the 988 line to be operational \nwithin states, we are essentially changing the ten-digit telephone number for the \nNational Suicide Prevention Lifeline to the three-digit number. There is a projected \nnumber  of  increased  calls.  Nationally,  these  calls  are  projected  from  anywhere \nbetween 6 million and 13 million to high projections from 12 million to 41 million \nover the course of 5 years. \n \nThe  reason  for  the  increased  call  projections  is  the  calls  will  include  not  only \nexisting lifeline calls served by 988 but calls diverted from other existing crisis \nlines, 911 and potential new callers in the community who choose to call 988 \nshould they be in a behavioral health crisis. These call projections are essential \nwhen Nevada is determining how to grow our 988 call center. We are awaiting our \nState-specific projected call estimate. This will be essential in our planning and \npreparation for going live in July 2022. \n \nSlide 4 explains how 988 is the foundation for crisis care. There are gaps within \nthe crisis system in our communities. We have spoken with this Committee and the \nInterim Committees around the need for crisis services. Primarily, we rely on 911 \nwhich triggers the emergency response through emergency medical services (EMS) \nand law enforcement, sometimes with tragic outcomes. The ideal crisis system \nwould match the right intervention to the right person, at the right place and at the \nright time. It is estimated that approximately 80 percent of individuals who call a \ncrisis  line  have  their  issues  resolved  over  the  phone.  Without  such  services, \nindividuals may forego the care they need or unnecessarily use high-cost services \nsuch as emergency rooms. \n \nIn 2020 when we did the mapping, we found there were still significant gaps in the \ncapabilities  of  Nevada’s  crisis  call  line  that  will  need  to  be  addressed  in  the \nimplementation planning for the 988 system. In Nevada on any given day, we have \nmore than 90 individuals waiting in emergency rooms for inpatient care, many of \nwhom  could  be  and  should  be  better  served  within  other  care  settings.  In \n2020 alone, we had just under 18,000 visits to emergency rooms by individuals \nwho had a diagnosis of either suicide attempt or ideation. \n \nWe know from some of the mapping done that our rural areas have significant \naccess-to-care issues. Because of this limitation, law enforcement is often used to \ntransport—sometimes five individuals in seven  hours—to  urban areas to ensure \nindividuals being seen by a behavioral health professional. By expanding access to \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 33 \n \n988  and  the  additional  crisis  services,  we  can  ensure  individuals  are  served \nadequately in their community whenever possible. \n \nThe  overutilization  of  emergency  services  within  EMS  and  law  enforcement \ncontinues to resolve costly use of critical public safety resources, lengthy wait \ntimes and sometimes a mismatch of intervention to needs. \n \nSlide 5 reviews the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act of 2020 and what it \nrequires. The National Suicide Designation Act passed in 2020 and became a law in \nOctober 2020. We need to go live and have that rolled out by July 16, 2022. We \nanticipate significant growth in the number of calls projected to the 988 line, so we \nneed to prepare our system to answer those calls and do the critical work of \nconnecting those individuals to additional care should it be needed. That additional \ncare may be community-based providers, mobile crisis teams or crisis stabilization \ncenters. \n \nAt the federal level, legislation authorizes states to establish a fee, and that fee will \nbe established in a fund. That fund should be sequestered to be obligated and \nexpended only in support of 988 and crisis services. We are looking at a go-live \ndate of July 16, 2022, regardless of whether we generate additional funding or \nnot. \n \nSlide 6 reviews the guiding principles of the 988 line. These include making sure \n988 is universally available by call, text or chat. Chat is an extension of what is \nalready available through our crisis support services. We want to ensure these calls \nare  consistently  responded  to  with  services  in  line  with  best  practices  and  a \nlocalized response. \n \nSlide 7 shows the national landscape of crisis legislation. Nevada is not the only \nstate proposing legislation. We have two states that have signed similar bills into \nlaw,  Washington  and  Virginia.  Three  states  have  bills  passed  through  at  least \n1 house, and 14 additional states have introduced legislation based on some of the \nmodel legislation developed at the national level. \n \nSlides 8 and 9 cover the 8 core elements for the implementation plan. In tangent to \nthis legislation, 49 other states have been granted a planning grant. At the national \nand  federal  levels,  they  see  the  importance  of  states  preparing  to  go  live  in \nJuly 2022. We are implementing the planning grant which requires us to establish \nan implementation plan to be submitted by August. Each of the eight core elements \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 34 \n \nmust be addressed in the plan. The plan will be addressing the elements listed on \nSlides 8 and 9. \n \nAdditional resources are shown on Slide 10 should any Committee members want \nto  refer  to  the  community  mapping  I  identified  earlier.  We  did  some  lengthy \ncommunity mapping by state and by region, including looking at all assets and gaps \nacross the entire crisis continuum of care. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThe proposed amendment, Exhibit N, changes the mental health crisis to behavioral \nhealth crisis to be more inclusive in the language. Bottom line, this bill seeks the \nauthority to raise the fee authorized in federal legislation. Once the 988 line goes \nlive, call volume will increase. Our lifeline is operational now, but if the resources \ndo  not  keep  up  with  the  volume  of  calls,  people  will  wait  to  have  their  calls \nanswered when they are experiencing suicidal ideation. That is the worst possible \noutcome. \n \nWe do not get to choose when it goes live. We have the planning grant to which \nthe State is processing data and analysis of how many calls may merit a fee that \nmakes sense. Rather than putting a dollar amount on that fee in statute, it is \nallowed in regulatory process because we do not want to under-shoot or overshoot \nthe law. \n \nToday’s 911 fees in our State range from $.45 to $1.25 per month. This range is \nbecause 911 is driven at the county level. Counties have different rates they have \nassessed. Other states’ fees have been in the 30-cent range. Rather than guessing, \nthe regulatory process would allow for a look at the data to decide what we need \nand set the fee. National campaigns to promote the 988 number will create an \ninflux of calls, so it is important we turn the 988 line on and ensure sure we have \nthe resources to respond to these calls. \n \nUtah  just  passed  its  bill.  In  addition  to  establishing  a  rate,  the  state  did  a \n$16 million allocation to do the interoperability work that could get everyone ready \nfor 911 and 988. We are not asking for that at this point, but we are asking to not \nleave the lifeline hanging without the resources it needs once it is live. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 35 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIs it possible for this first allocation of settlement funds from the Office of the \nAttorney General to fund the stand-up of the 988 line so we can see the volume \nand get a better idea the ongoing resource needs? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThe  988  fee  money  is  less  about  the  stand-up  and  more  about  the  ongoing \noperating costs. This is more about the first-tier money the Crisis Support Services \nof Nevada would need to add extra staff to answer additional calls, texts and \nchats. While there could be a large amount of money coming our way, it is not \nnecessarily sustainable ongoing money. \n \nAnalysis based on the $45 million settlement would have come to us. Language in \nthat $45 million settlement directs where money should go for the opioid impact, \nand we would have to make the argument that everything in the crisis response \nsystem has that nexus to the opioid impact. \n \nIt is unknown where that allocation will go. Dr. Woodard and I have discussed \nstand-up  dollars  and  the  American  Rescue  Plan.  In  terms  of  one-shot  monies, \nparticularly on interoperability between 911 and 988, I will vote for everything we \nneed to spend that money on. \n \nThis is about the ongoing dollars, year in and year out, the actual services to be \nprovided through the phone lines, and any excess can trickle down to the mobile \noutreach teams and stabilization centers. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nHow much funding do we allocate toward this now? \n \nDR. WOODARD: \nThrough the Bureau of Behavioral Health Wellness and Prevention, Crisis Support \nServices of Nevada receives just under $1.1 million. The intent going forward is the \nfunds generated through fees, and the fund would not supplant, but supplement \nthose funds. We continue to commit funding as long as it is available, including \neligible federal grants we applied for and used to help the Crisis Support Services \nof Nevada to do that work. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIs there an anticipated reduction in 911 workload? \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 36 \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nInitially, no. There is hope that over time that would happen. The front end of this \nwill be more about collaboration and interoperability, so there may potentially be \nmore  work  for  911.  We  need  them  to  update  their  protocols  to  triage  calls \nappropriately to do a handoff to the 988 team when the calls come in to them. On \nthe front end, and until enough of the public gets trained to call 988, they will have \nthe same workload; they will just be routing the calls to a different place. \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nIs 8 percent of the funding going to be used for administrative purposes? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nUp to 8 percent will be used for administrative purposes. \n \nDR. WOODARD: \nWe added the standard 5 percent administrative cap; the 8 percent are the indirect \nfees. If we are providing grant funds to any entities, they can charge no more than \n8 percent in indirect fees to those costs. \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nIt will be important for staff to look like the people we serve. If we do not state this \nin the bill, it is easy to overlook. Diversity in the staff is crucial. \n \nThe language barrier and 911 have been an issue happening in several areas where \nI live. If there is a way to identify the most prominent languages for an area, that \nwould be helpful, unless the calls go into a central location and are then passed on \nto specific places. What can we anticipate in terms of language challenges? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThis is building off the suicide crisis lifeline already in place. Language access is a \nsignificant part of the work they have done. It is baked into the bill, and as you \nstated, not every language is available all of the time. Because we are talking about \nsuicide crisis response, in many cases that has been anticipated. \n \nA directive about staff would put human resources policy into a bill that I am \nneither sure would fit in nor sure what we could do in terms of mandating diversity \nfor staff. In many of the efforts you are working on, we will make that a priority. I \nam unsure we can tie it to a specific program. Adding input and decision makers on \nall stakeholder engagement can be tackled in this. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 37 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIf we recognize the power faith-based organizations have, even if they “aren’t” the \nemployee but the power in knowing about 988, we will get at what we are doing. \nIf we do not have the trust of faith-based organizations, the look-alikes, we lose \ninstead of gain. To look-alike, sound-alike, worship alike and be alike are critical for \nthe process. Whether they are hired or not, they need to be involved. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThey are explicitly referenced on the opioid settlement planning and stakeholder \nengagement process. There are no details in the bill about the 988 rollout, but \nfaith-based organizations would be part of the strategy. \n \nROBIN REEDY (National Alliance on Mental Illness): \nI will read from my written testimony (Exhibit Q) in support of S.B. 390. \n \nMARY WALKER (Carson City; Douglas County; Carson Tahoe Health System): \nI am representing Carson City, Douglas County and Carson Tahoe Health System in \nsupport of S.B. 390. There is also a written statement (Exhibit R) in support of \nS.B. 390 from Alan Garrett, President and CEO of Carson Tahoe Health. \n \nSenate Bill 390 is the best opportunity I have seen in many years for the State \nworking  in  partnership  with  local  government,  healthcare  providers  and  many \nnonprofit  stakeholders  to  fund  and  improve  mental  health  services  in  Nevada. \nOften, mental health programs are the last to be funded and the last to expand \nservices. With S.B. 390, significant advances can be made to help people with \nthese  needs  on  the  ground,  not  only  with  opioid  funding  but  with  the \nimplementation of a suicide prevention lifeline. \n \nI appreciate the thoughtful approach to developing a comprehensive grant system \nas provided in S.B.  390 and its proposed amendment, Exhibit N. This bill  has \nseveral checks and balances including reporting requirements and limitations to the \nuse of the funding, which will mean there is an effort to ensure every dollar will \ncount. \n \nOMAR SAUCEDO (AT&T): \nBy way of standing in support of S.B. 390, AT&T provides traditional landline \nservice, voice and wireless service—essentially, all the areas of voice service in \nNevada. We have seen numerous 988 bills to fund suicide prevention and mental \nhealth crisis operations introduced in other states. As a result of the new federal \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 38 \n \nlaw,  some  states  have  elected  to  implement  a  surcharge  similar  to  what  is \nproposed  in  S.B. 390,  while  other  states  have  paid  for  the  program  with \ngeneral fund dollars. We hope to continue to work with the bill sponsor to ensure \nthe surcharge funding base is equitable and includes technologies as similar bills in \nColorado, Idaho and Kansas have considered and passed. \n \nIn an effort to ensure transparency, we respectfully encourage an ongoing process \nfor consumer dollars collected under this surcharge being periodically reviewed and \nadjusted based on the actual direct cost of the crisis centers that respond to these \n988 calls. Likewise, once we have worked through the implementation and start-up \ncosts, it would be reasonable to expect the surcharge could be adjusted downward \nbased on the ongoing budget needs. \n \nIt is important to note the federal 988 law provides specific language as to what \nsurcharge funds can be used for under this act. This is relevant because voice and \nwireless services are regulated at the federal level, not the state level. The states’ \nauthority here is narrowly defined. \n \nAs the bill makes its way through the legislative process, we would appreciate the \nopportunity to take part in any working group or stakeholder meeting and in any \ntask force charged with the implementation of this important program. \n \nJENNIFER CLAYPOOL: \nI support S.B. 390. I have been a volunteer on the National Suicide Prevention \nLifeline and a caller to the lifeline. I know what a valuable resource it can be. When \nyou are in the deepest, darkest time of your life, trying to remember a ten-digit \nphone number can be almost impossible. \n \nOnce the 988 line is operational, many people in the frontier and rural parts of \nNevada may want to help but cannot get to the crisis centers where the calls will \ncome in. Moving forward, it is my hope there will be plans to implement rural crisis \ncenters for those individuals to receive and provide help. \n \nJAMIE RODRIGUEZ (Washoe County): \nWashoe County supports S.B. 390. \n \nCHRISTINA CAPPELLO (American Foundation for Suicide Prevention): \nThe American Foundation for Suicide Prevention supports S.B. 390. We are the \nleading national not-for-profit organization exclusively dedicated to saving lives and \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 39 \n \nbringing hope to those affected by suicide. Our local Nevada chapter carries out \nthis mission across the State through research, education, advocacy and support \nefforts. \n \nI stand in support of S.B. 390 as a survivor of suicide loss and in support of my \nloved ones, including my mother, who have struggled with their mental health and \nhave  called  the  National  Suicide  Prevention  Lifeline.  While  factors  leading  an \nindividual to attempt suicide are complex, many of the impacts of Covid-19 are \nassociated with increased risk of suicide including social disconnection, anxiety, \ndepression, substance use, loss, grief and lack of access to physical and mental \nhealth care. \n \nWe do not yet know the impact on suicide rates. There could be increases in \nsuicide  risk  if  community  cohesion  diminishes  and  less  attention  is  paid  to \nintentional social connections, proactive resilience and mental health self-care, and \nthe importance of engaging mental health treatment. Statewide crisis call centers \nand crisis response services need more resources and funding to build capacity and \nresponse to growing community crisis needs. \n \nSoon, callers experiencing a suicide or mental health crisis will call 988 instead of \n911  to  receive  appropriate  care  and  mitigate  unnecessary  law  enforcement \ninvolvement.  Reliance  on  law  enforcement  often  means  people  suffering  from \nmental illnesses are put through an expensive and traumatizing revolving door as \nthey shuttle between jails, emergency rooms and the streets. \n \nMS. JACOB: \nClark County supports S.B. 390. \n \nGERARD KEEGAN (Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association): \nI will read from written testimony (Exhibit S) in neutral to S.B. 390. \n \nRACHELLE L. PELLISSIER (Crisis Support Services of Nevada): \nCrisis Support Services of Nevada was established in 1966 as an all-volunteer, \n24-hour suicide prevention hotline to address the high rate of suicide in Nevada. \nCrisis Support Services is one of the longest running crisis call centers in the Nation \nand the lifeline call center for the entire State. Any calls from Nevada area codes \nfrom the lifeline number 800-273-8255 come into our facility. We are also one of \nonly nine national call centers that receives calls from other regions when their call \ncenters are overwhelmed. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 40 \n \nWhen 988 is implemented, all calls from Nevada will come into our facility. It will \nallow Nevadans in a behavioral health crisis to easily access crisis intervention \nservices because they will not have to find and call a ten-digit number. For too \nlong,  our  system  of  mental  health  crisis  services  has  been  underfunded  and \nundervalued.  It  is  time  to  meet  this  challenge  with  the  evidence-based  crisis \nintervention and care systems the 988 crisis line will provide. \n \nSenate Bill 390 will allow us the vital funding sources we need to provide the crisis \nintervention  Nevadans  need  and  deserve.  Our  answer  rate  of  lifeline  calls  is \napproximately 80 percent, and the queue time averages 65 seconds. In a crisis, \n65 seconds is a lifetime. When 988 is implemented, it is estimated the call volume \nwill increase up to 30 percent. If we do not fund the system through this bill, we \nwill not have the appropriate resources to address this increase in volume which \nmeans answer rates will plummet and wait times will increase. We will not have \nthe  resources  to  help  implement  the  vital  mobile  teams  and  crisis  stabilization \ncenters across the State. \n \nCrisis Support Services of Nevada supports S.B. 390. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nWe have been in contact with AT&T that asked us about including additional lines. \nOur legal counsel looked into it, and the authorizing language at the federal level \nonly calls out cell lines; therefore, that is what we can include. AT&T has worked \non this in other states and will provide me with additional information to see if it \ngets a different assessment. We would ultimately like to include all lines as this \nwould generate additional revenue and keep the fee lower for everyone else. \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 390. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will open the hearing on S.B. 325. \n \nSENATE BILL 325: Establishes provisions relating to preventing the acquisition of \nhuman immunodeficiency virus. (BDR 54-632). \n \nSENATOR JAMES A. SETTELMEYER (Senatorial District No. 17): \nSenate Bill 325 and the proposed amendment (Exhibit T) seek to allow pharmacists \nto prescribe a protocol authorizing pharmacists to dispense drugs that prevent the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 41 \n \nacquisition of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and set forth the ability for \nthem to do such things as testing and other matters. \n \nWe are experiencing a healthcare shortage in Nevada, and we need more doctors. \nThis bill seeks to try to bring in another avenue for individuals to receive drugs for \npreventing the acquisition of HIV. \n \nELIZABETH MACMENAMIN (Retail Association of Nevada): \nIn Nevada, we experience the lack of health care or the ability for some to receive \nhealth care. Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, community pharmacies have been \ngranted an increased authority to provide enhanced access to essential medicines \nand  clinical  care,  for  example,  the  testing  and  immunizations  they  have  been \nproviding throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. \n \nEffective deliveries of these care services have further underscored the value that a \npharmacist and pharmacy team offer to best meet the healthcare needs of their \ncommunities. An estimated 1.1 million people are living with HIV in the United \nStates, and 14 percent, 1 in 7 people, are unaware they are infected. Community \npharmacies provide affordable quality healthcare services and can improve access \nto HIV testing and preventative medications for those who need it while at the \nsame time addressing the health disparities we have in Nevada. \n \nThe  number  of  HIV  infections  disproportionately  affect  minority  populations, \nincluding Black and Latino individuals which represent 69 percent of all new HIV \ndiagnoses. Pharmacists and their staffs are standing ready to provide expanded, \ntimely and convenient access to HIV testing and prevention through increasing \naccess  to  and  use  of  the  pre-exposure  prophylactic  (PrEP)  or  post-exposure \nprophylactic (PEP). \n \nNevada law should be modernized to enable pharmacists to provide public health \nservices to its citizens. Twelve states have taken steps to expand access. This \ninformation  is  included  in  the  pre-exposure  prophylaxis  articles  (Exhibit  U), \nSecondary HIV Prevention by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (Exhibit V) \nand state information (Exhibit W). \n \nANDRE WADE (Silver State Equality): \nThe HIV virus weakens a person’s immune system by destroying cells that fight \ndisease  and  infection.  Although  there  is  no  effective  cure  for  HIV,  it  can  be \nmanaged  and  controlled  through  medication.  There  are  various  modes  of \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 42 \n \ntransmission for HIV such as sex and drug injection equipment. However, there are \nways in which HIV transmission can be prevented by the use of medication such as \nPrEP, which has about a 99 percent effective rate, or PEP, which has about a \n90 percent effective rate depending on the mode of transmission. \n \nA  five-year  Ending  the  HIV  Epidemic:  A  Plan  for  America  was  developed  in \nresponse  to  the  guidance  provided  by  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and \nPrevention (CDC). Nevada has been unquestionably impacted by the HIV epidemic \nwith the highest rate of new infections in the western United States. Furthermore, \nlarge racial ethnic disparities exist in HIV transmission, particularly among the Black \npopulation as mentioned previously. \n \nFour pillars defined by the CDC include diagnose, treat, prevent and respond. Focus \ngroups across the State were conducted by the End the HIV Epidemic group to \nallow people to weigh in on shaping the plan to end HIV in Nevada. In these focus \ngroups, access to acknowledge PrEP and PEP has been identified as an important \nstrategy. A strength related to prevention includes the trust people have in local \ncommunity clinics and organizations. \n \nA goal for the Ending the HIV Epidemic Plan is to prevent new HIV transmission by \nusing  proven  interventions  including  PrEP  and  PEP.  Senate  Bill  325  will  help \nincrease access to medication and services that can prevent the transmission of \nHIV by enabling pharmacists to provide medication to consumers. Today’s law \nshould fully recognize the ability of a pharmacist to order, administer, bill and be \nreimbursed for FDA-authorized tests. It would be a game changer for Nevada if \nconsumers could access medications like PrEP and PEP with a single visit to the \npharmacy without the need for authorization. \n \nJOHN “ROB” PHOENIX (Huntridge Family Clinic): \nI will read from my written testimony (Exhibit X) in support of S.B. 325. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI look at the pre- and post-exposure medications much like the Plan B One-Step \nmorning after pill. The pharmacist does not need to make a diagnosis. One issue \nmissing in the bill is follow-up care. If we get a positive test, the person ought to \nbe under the care of someone. Pre- and post-exposure is vital.  \n \nIt is critical that the pharmacist is in a position to make this happen. I do not want \na person waiting for the next day, or days to follow, when you are supposed to see \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 43 \n \nyour doctor in order to get a prescription. I want to make sure this is available for \neither or all partners who have been exposed. This is a critical option for people to \nhave access to. \n \nKAYLYNN BOWMAN: \nAs a licensed pharmacist, I support S.B. 325. I have practiced for 14 years in \nNevada. The legislation proposed in this bill will prove timely and equitable access \nto HIV preventative care in Nevada. We are experiencing a time where pharmacists \ncan provide improved access to care that is convenient, private and affordable. \nThrough a grant with Ryan White Part A Program, I work with patients living with \nHIV  by  providing  medication  adherence  counseling,  health  education  and  risk \nreduction classes, along with wellness checks. \n \nMaking HIV preventative care through neighborhood pharmacies easily accessible \nto all persons in Nevada will help stop the spread of HIV. Pharmacists follow State \nprotocols for immunizations and analoxum therapies and are skilled and capable of \nproviding other clinical services, such as access to birth control and HIV preventive \ntherapies.  Pharmacists  can  order  and  perform  laboratory  testing  and  provide \nnecessary drug therapy for preventing the acquisition of HIV. \n \nThis legislation also supports the requirement for public and private health plans \nincluding Medicaid to cover HIV prevention drug therapies, any related laboratory \ntesting, prescribing and dispensing by a pharmacist at an equal rate of that by a \nphysician, physician assistant or advanced nurse practitioner for similar services. It \nwill also advance the profession of pharmacy in Nevada which will in turn improve \nthe health of our patients. \n \nLEANA RAMIREZ: \nI will read from my written testimony (Exhibit Y) in support of S.B. 325. \n \nKENNETH KUNKE (Nevada Pharmacy Alliance): \nI will read from my written testimony (Exhibit Z) in support of S.B. 325. \n \nCHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS (Southern Nevada Health Consortium): \nThe  Southern  Nevada  Health  Consortium  supports  S.B. 325.  This  organization \nworks  to  combat  stigma  around  HIV  by  ending  the  HIV  epidemic  through \ncommunity education and linkage to services. The HIV virus remains a significant \npublic issue in Nevada as we rank fifth in the Nation for the number of individuals \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 44 \n \nnewly diagnosed with HIV. There are people living with HIV in all 17 counties in \nNevada. \n \nOne of the goals of the federal Ending the HIV Epidemic Plan is the reduction of \nnew infections by 75 percent by 2025 and 90 percent by 2030. The Plan focuses \non the 50 local areas that account for more than half of new diagnoses in the \nCountry, and Clark County is one of the 48 counties listed. One of the ways to \nreduce those infections is to create access to PrEP which has shown to be over \n99 percent effective in preventing the sexual transmission of HIV when taken as \nprescribed. Access to PrEP is an issue this bill helps to address. Nevada has a \nsignificant shortage of primary care providers, yet the majority of Americans live \nwithin five miles of a pharmacy and are able to access those services. \n \nIn  addition  to  dispensing  medications  and  ensuring  patient  safety,  today’s \npharmacists  are  taking  a  larger  role  as  medical  counselors,  educators  and \nadvocates, and have a greater accessibility in the community. It sometimes takes \nweeks to months to get an appointment with a medical provider; it is much easier \nto access and speak with a pharmacist. Unlike an appointment with a doctor, you \nhave more than 15 minutes to address your issues. \n \nAs one of the more than 10,500 people living with HIV in Nevada, I would love to \nhave had access to medications to prevent my HIV diagnosis. I would urge you to \nconsider the changing role of pharmacists as a member of the medical care team, \nNevada’s role in ending the HIV epidemic and how eliminating the barrier of access \nto PrEP can impact the thousands of Nevadans at risk of acquiring HIV. \n \nMATT ROBINSON (Southern Nevada Health District): \nThe Southern Nevada Health District is neutral on S.B. 325 and generally believes \nthat any effort to expand access to preventative medicines should be embraced. It \nis critical that during the regulation creation process the proper standards of care \nprotocols be adopted by the State Board of Pharmacy as is called for in the bill. \n \nDUANE YOUNG (Deputy Administrator, Division of Health Care Financing and Policy, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nThe Division of Health Care Financing and Policy recognizes there is a fiscal note. \nThis is a budget-neutral initiative since it would transfer the cost of visits that \nwould regularly occur under a primary care physician, advance practice registered \nnurse or physician assistant to a pharmacist. Transferring that to the pharmacist \nhas no initial cost. However, there is a fiscal note for system upgrades. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 45 \n \nThe Division has taken steps to remove that fiscal note because the cost can be \nabsorbed in other areas as similar bills would establish this provider type. We have \nnotified the sponsor of this and taken the steps to remove that. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will entertain a motion on S.B. 325. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN MOVED TO AMEND AND DO PASS AS AMENDED \nS.B. 325. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 325 and open the hearing on S.B. 341. \n \nSENATE BILL 341: Revises provisions relating to health care. (BDR 40-62) \n \nSENATOR PAT SPEARMAN (SENATORIAL DISTRICT NO. 1): \nAs Mr. James Baldwin said, “Not everything that is faced can be changed, but \nnothing can be changed until it is faced.” \n \nThis bill is an effort to face systemic racism and structures of racial discrimination \nin  Nevada  and  elsewhere  that  create  generational  poverty  and  perpetual, \ndebilitating, economic, educational health hardships for people of color. Today, I \nreceived notice that the CDC agrees with Nevada. On Thursday, the CDC called \nracism a serious threat to public health thus becoming the latest and largest United \nStates-based health agency to single out racism as having a profound and negative \nimpact on communities of color and contributing to disproportionate mortality rates \namong people of color. \n \nThis bill is designed to not just recognize this exists but to ensure we are doing \neverything possible we can to correct it. The CDC also noted that communities of \ncolor suffered disproportionately in terms of contracting and becoming fatalities in \nCovid-19. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 46 \n \nA  friend  of  mine  told  me  that  people  of  European  decent  caught  a  cold  with \nCovid-19, but people in BIPOC communities contracted pneumonia. With this bill, \nwe can put things in place to address this. \n \nThe conceptual amendment (Exhibit AA) addresses the biggest sections of the bill. \nOriginally, we said it would delete sections 6, 7, 12, 13, 14 and 15 of the bill. We \nare deleting the requirement for a task force and making changes in how these \nprograms are funded. \n \nIt is critical we do this while focusing on making good changes; now is the time to \nact. \n \nSections 2 and 17 require the Division of Public and Behavioral Health (DPBH) of \nDHHS  to  apply  for  grants  from  the  federal  government  and  other  sources  to \nsupport the provisions of health care, promote the well-being, behavioral health and \nemotional well-being in communities with a higher risk of problems. \n \nBefore Governor Steve Sisolak issued the executive order, a number of things were \nhappening in BIPOC communities. Those things were exacerbated by Covid-19. We \nhad more illness and, as mentioned previously, mental and behavioral emotional \nhealth issues. Organizations in the community were picking up the slack. We had \none funeral home owner and director, who is a counselor, and some pastors, who \nwere  fielding  questions  of  sadness  that  came  about  from  Covid-19,  trying  to \nreassure people that everything would be alright. \n \nWe  pieced  together  things  that  would  help  get  the  community  through  this \nepidemic. A pastor, Pastor Robert Fowler of the Victory Missionary Baptist Church, \nwhose presence in the community was so large many people considered him their \npastor, passed away suddenly. The day we got the news, I was attempting to \nmake contact with the pastoral staff to see if there was anything I could do but \nwas  unable  to  help  out.  While  on  the  phone  with  one  of  our  United  States \nSenators, the pastoral senior staff said they were struggling because all of the \nmembers were asking what they should do, but they were having problems too and \ndid not know where to turn. \n \nSenate Bill 341 is designed to ensure we are focusing on the needs of the BIPOC \ncommunities  as  they  have  been  hit  harder  than  anywhere  else  and  to  ensure \nmonies that come into the State are distributed proportionately to those who have \nbeen affected. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 47 \n \nJEANETTE BELZ (Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Inc.): \nChronic kidney disease is the ninth-leading cause of death in the United States. An \nestimated 37 million people in the United States have chronic kidney disease, and \nover 40,000 people in Nevada are living with the disease. Early chronic kidney \ndisease has no signs or symptoms and without early detection can progress to \nkidney failure. If a person has high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes or a \nfamily history of kidney failure, the risk of kidney disease is greater. In Nevada, \n10.7 percent of all adults have diabetes, and nearly 33 percent have high blood \npressure. The prevalence of diabetes, heart disease and hypertension is higher for \nAfrican Americans who develop kidney failure at a rate of nearly 4 to 1 compared \nto Caucasians. Hispanics have a 30 percent higher risk of developing kidney failure. \nAlmost  19.5  percent  of  the  people  in  Nevada  waiting  for  a  kidney  identify  as \nAfrican American. In 2019, less than 7 percent of them received a kidney. \n \nAlthough  dialysis  is  a  life-extending  treatment,  the  best  and  most  effective \ntreatment for kidney failure is a kidney transplant. The waitlist in Nevada for a \ndeceased donor kidney is 5 to 7 years; nationally, 12 people die every day waiting. \n \nIf  chronic  kidney  disease  is  detected  early  and  managed  appropriately,  the \nindividual can receive treatment sooner to protect the kidneys, and deterioration of \nkidney  function  can  be  slowed  and  even  stopped.  The  risk  of  associated \ncardiovascular complications and other complications can also be reduced. \n \nIt is imperative to provide support to those with kidney disease in light of the \nCovid-19  pandemic,  the  increased  risk  of  infection  to  patients  with  preexisting \nconditions and Covid-19 patients acquiring acute kidney disease. \n \nThese  are  the  reasons  support  is  needed  for  the  establishment  of  the  Kidney \nDisease Prevention and Education Task Force. There are two main charges for the \nTask  Force  in  the  bill.  First,  to  create  health  education  programs  and \nrecommendations to increase awareness of and examine chronic kidney disease, \ntransplantations, living and deceased kidney donations, and the existing disparity in \nthe rates of those afflicted between Caucasians and minorities. \n \nSecond,  to  develop  a  sustainable  plan  to  raise  awareness  and  early  detection, \npromote health equity and reduce the burden of kidney disease throughout the \nState. This will lead to educating the public about the disease, especially for our \nmore vulnerable populations, resulting in cost savings for the healthcare system \nand improved quality of life. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 48 \n \nThe DHHS is supportive of the public health focus of this proposal. Although there \nmay  be  some  cost,  an  opportunity  for  short-term  investments  has  long-term \nbenefits for the State and Nevadans. \n \nDonna  Spearman  waited  as  long  as  she  could  to  testify  today  in  support  of \nS.B. 341. She is a chronic kidney disease patient and wholeheartedly believes in \nthe benefits of supporting this Task Force. \n \nFRANCO REYNA (National Kidney Foundation): \nI will read from my written testimony (Exhibit AB) in support of S.B. 341. \n \nCINDY VALLETTE (American Kidney Fund): \nI will read from my written testimony (Exhibit AC) in support of S.B. 341. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nDonna Spearman did tell me she wanted to testify today. She has been on dialysis \nfor  three  years  now.  Some  may  remember  when  she  was  helping  me  out \nadministratively. Her stage 3 kidney failure was advancing to stage 4, and she had \nto stop. \n \nKidney disease is a horrible thing for families to go through. One of my younger \nbrothers was diagnosed with stage 3 kidney disease and recently passed away. He \nalso had high blood pressure and had been diagnosed with diabetes. \n \nKidney disease, kidney failure, diabetes and high blood pressure are prevalent in \nBIPOC communities. In 2017 and early 2018, I was getting a checkup at a military \nhospital, and the doctor had me do some lab testing. At the third visit, she told me \nI was at a prediabetic stage and had to lose some weight. I had gained weight due \nto the steroids I was taking for asthma. I immediately changed my food intake and \nwas able to lose weight which brought me back from the brink. \n \nThis is something we can control and help reduce if we focus on it. We keep \ntalking  about  doing  something  about  mental,  emotional  and  physical  health  in \nBIPOC communities. If we do nothing, it is like someone yelling your house is on \nfire and not calling the fire department. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nLooking at the conceptual amendment, Exhibit AA, there are four items. Item 1 \ndeletes sections 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, and 15. Those sections of the bill are identical to \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 49 \n \nanother bill which passed out of the Senate Government Affairs Committee today. \nIf both of these bills pass and get amended in any other form as we go through the \nprocess, the potential is there for a conflict. It is my understanding you wanted to \namend out these sections to avoid that conflict, is that correct? \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThat is correct. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nItem 2, Exhibit AA, deletes the sections relating to the Kidney Disease Prevention \nand Education Task Force and Fund including sections 3, 4, 5, 18 and 19. Based \non your testimony, you would like to strike that part of the amendment and keep \nthe Task Force in, correct? \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThe Task Force is where the fiscal note came in. If we delete the Task Force, it is \nmy understanding the fiscal note will go away, and we can proceed with grant \nfunding from the government and other appropriate agencies. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIf you delete those sections, there will not be a Task Force. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI understand. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDo you want to leave those sections in and keep the Task Force, or do you want to \npull those sections out and take out the Task Force? \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nTake out the Task Force. \n \nMS. BELZ: \nI did speak to DHHS, and it indicated not all of the fiscal note was related to the \nTask Force, only a portion. If the Task Force is removed, it takes out about half of \nthe fiscal note. Also, DHHS said there would be some opportunity to talk about \nwhittling  that  down,  perhaps  based  on  some  changes  in  expectations  of  the \nTask Force, like frequency of meetings, scope of material they would look at as \nwell as some other things. There would still be a fiscal note, but I cannot speak to \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 50 \n \nhow large it would be. The DHHS said it was an important public policy from a \npublic health standpoint, and there would be an opportunity to talk about that. My \nimpression is that it would not remove the fiscal note, just make it smaller. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nWe talked about section 2, applying for available grants from the government and \nother sources. Whatever we have to do to eliminate the fiscal note, scaling back \nsome things and adding others, I am willing to do it. \n \nThis bill is extremely important, and I do not want to take out the portion about \nkidney  disease  education.  At  the  same  time,  we  are  talking  about  part  of  the \nproblem that led to susceptibility for Covid-19 and for increased mortality rates \namong BIPOC communities. I do not know what money may come to Nevada, or \nwhat has already come. If we take out the items where the fiscal note would \nstand, it is my hope that DHHS and DPBH would look at how these communities \nhave been ravaged by Covid-19 and provide something proactive so when the next \npandemic hits, the same communities do not have to pay the same price. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSections 3 and 4 clarify the grant process. The original language in the bill was \nfrom  “any  source,  including  without  limitation,”  which  left  the  impression  that \nDHHS  would  need  to  apply  for  any  grant  that  dropped  in  its  lap  whether \nappropriate for the State or not. By modifying that language to “and other sources” \ninstead of “any,” that removes the other part of the fiscal note. \n \nMy understanding is that sections 3 and 4 remove the fiscal note related to the \ngrant  writing  process,  and  sections  3,  4,  5,  18  and  19  are  related  to  the \nTask Force. \n \nTo clarify, to remove the grant writing portion of the fiscal note, you would like to \nkeep items 3 and 4 on the amendment, as in that modifier changing it to “and \nother sources,” so DHHS is still directed to write grants but not necessarily every \ngrant that comes its way, is that correct? \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThat is correct. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 51 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIf we are instituting a new competitive grant process, work goes along with this \nthat DHHS may want to look at. The creation of a new account, and the fact that \nfunds going into that account are based on the legislation, would revert to the \nState General Fund and carry forward; that is something we do not usually do. \nSection  8,  subsection  1  of  the  bill  creates  a  new  Minority  Health  and  Equity \nAccount  in  the  General  Fund.  For  the  purposes  of  whether  the  bill  goes  to \nSenate Finance, some provisions in this will have to be discussed by the Finance \nCommittee regardless of the provisions we just discussed. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSenator  Spearman,  I  would  leave  the  Task  Force  in  the  bill.  As  indicated  by \nMs. Belz, there is opportunity for a conversation about the degree of the fiscal note \nand what Senator Kieckhefer has mentioned. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nCreating the new account was something brought to me by the Director of the \nOffice of Minority Health and Equity. It was designed to make sure the Office has \nwhat is needed to attack these diseases. We can keep that in the bill and justify \nthe request if it should go to Finance. \n \nI want to ensure these communities get what they should. This bill is a result of \nbeing frustrated last Session because of no way to get money targeted to these \ncommunities, and people are dying. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nItem 1 of the conceptual amendment deletes sections 6, 7, 12, 13, 14 and 15 as \nthey are replicated in another bill. \n \nItem 2 will be put back into the bill. Everything having to do with the Task Force \nwill be added back. \n \nItems 3 and 4 direct DHHS to apply for grants, but not just any grant available, and \nthis removes the fiscal note. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIf we passed this bill in Senate Government Affairs without a fiscal note and we \nput a fiscal note on it, we have not lost anything except the bill will have to go to \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 52 \n \nthe Finance Committee. We need not be afraid of a fiscal note because we have \nanother avenue if something comes up. \n \nCHAIR RATTI:  \nThe sections in item 1 being removed are something different. They have language \nthat talks about how the State appropriates money specifically to health care and \nmakes decisions to ensure the money is correctly appropriated to impact disparate \ncommunities  of  color.  The  sections  being  removed  have  not  been  part  of  the \ndiscussion  so  far.  This  separate  concept  now  lives  in  two  bills  that  we  are \nattempting to make into one bill. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nMy  understanding  of  the  proposed  amendment,  Exhibit  AA,  as  revised  by  the \nsponsor, leaves in sections 16 and 17 which have to do with behavioral health care \nand managed care. We have not talked about those. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN:  \nThe concern from the MCOs is the word strategies, and what strategies speak to. \nWe need to come up with a way to not only treat what is happening now but to \nhave the strategy make sure we reduce the incidence. If another word would give \nthem comfort, I am willing to use that. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWhat is your intent with the language in the bill? \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThe intent is to ensure this bill, along with the bill that passed out of Senate \nGovernment  Affairs,  speaks  to  the  inadequacies  of  the  healthcare  system  we \nexperienced last year. Prior to Covid-19, the healthcare system was still failing \nBIPOC communities. \n \nThe intent is that physical, emotional and behavioral health in BIPOC communities \nbecomes a priority. That includes making sure we identify the issues and strategies \nto help us treat what is here now and reduce the incidence of those diseases at a \nlater date. \n \nREGAN COMIS (Anthem Blue Cross): \nAnthem Blue Cross is neutral on S.B. 341. With regard to section 16 of the bill, we \nhave had a discussion with Senator Spearman and will continue to work on this. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 53 \n \nBETH  HANDLER,  M.P.H.  (Deputy  Director,  Programs,  Department  of  Health  and \nHuman Services): \nThe conceptual amendment, Exhibit AA, which includes the deletion of sections 6, \n7, 12, 13, 14 and 15, is related to the Task Force. We did talk about how the \nTask Force could be reinstated within the bill. \n \nThe revisions to sections 2 and 17 include the language that removes the “any \nsource, including, without limitation” and adds “and other sources” following the \nreference to the federal government. This would allow us to remove the fiscal note \nsubmitted by DPBH. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nBy putting the Task Force back in the bill, the fiscal note associated with that \nwould stay with the bill, correct? \n \nMS. HANDLER: \nThe understanding is that there is staffing within the agency to help support the \nTask Force. The agency would still want to revisit that language. \n \nTINA DORTCH (Program Manager, Office of Minority Health and Equity, Department \nof Health and Human Services): \nI  will  read  from  my  written  testimony  (Exhibit  AD)  in  the  neutral  position  on \nS.B. 341. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will entertain a motion on S.B. 341. \n \nSENATOR  HARDY  MOVED  TO  AMEND  AND  DO  PASS  AS  AMENDED \nS.B. 341. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 341 and open the hearing on S.B. 397. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 54 \n \nSENATE BILL 397: Revises provisions relating to certain persons who remain in \nfoster care beyond the age of 18 years. (BDR 38-502) \n \nSENATOR JAMES OHRENSCHALL (Senatorial District No. 21): \nI will read from my written testimony on S.B. 397 (Exhibit AE) and the proposed \namendment (Exhibit AF). \n \nMS. DUFFY: \nThe Clark County amendment, Exhibit AF, is a product of discussions with child \nwelfare agencies and legal services. This amendment will ensure we are meeting \nfederal requirements to bring down federal matching funds to support the program \nand assist children aging out of foster care. \n \nSection 1 clarifies the State Division of Child and Family Services is the entity that \nwill establish a Title IV-E program for the State. The original bill had an individual \naccounting agency seemingly and potentially in control of that. \n \nSection 2 adds the term “young adult.” This will respect the fact that these people \nare no longer children but are young adults between the ages of 18 to 21 years, \nwho choose to participate in a plan of extended support services. If they initially \ndecline to participate in that plan, they may choose to come back between the \nages of 18 to 21 years to once again participate in the plan. \n \nThis section also defines extended support services and lays out the criteria the \nplan must include, such as education, employment and vocational training, unless \nthe young adult is unable to participate in these areas due to a medical or cognitive \nissue. \n \nSection  4  adds  new  language  to  participate  as  a  young  adult  in  an  extended \nsupport service program as this program will be Title IV-E reimbursable, which is \nthe federal funding we will use. For Clark and Washoe Counties, it is 100 percent \nGeneral Fund to support children aging out of foster care. This bill will change that \nallowing us to pull in Title IV-E federal money much needed by the State. \n \nSection 7 will make the program Title IV-E reimbursable. \n \nSection 1 has the agency creating the plan. Section 2 allows for the direct payment \nof money to foster homes, supervised independent living placement, which can be \nwith relatives or fictive kin, and other Title IV-E placements approved by the federal \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 55 \n \ngovernment.  This  can  also  be  from  payments  made  directly  to  a  vendor  of \napartments or condominiums for mortgage payment, or other providers of housing \nor independent living services. We may also pay the funds directly to the young \nadult. \n \nIf the payments go to a vendor or independent living placement, they may be in full \nor a partial payment. That would mean if rent is $500 a month and the payment is \n$775, we could pay $500 a month to the provider of placement, and the balance \nwould go to the young adult. If the plan is for the young adult to get the payments \ndirectly, he or she must get the full payment. \n \nThe newly added section 7, subsection 4 allows that young adult to alternate \nbetween the three types of payments. If you have children or young adults in your \nlife who move out and you provide them with $500 a month to pay their bills and \nyou find out they are not using the money appropriately, they may need to be \nbrought back into the household. Or perhaps they have come upon a hard time and \nwould rather have someone pay for their basic needs. There are on- and off-ramps \nin order to help young adults become independent. \n \nSection 8 is mostly conforming language to add the term “young adult” in place of \n“child” and “extended youth support services plan” in place of “jurisdiction.” \n \nIn section 8, subsection 4, paragraph (c), we are ensuring young adults retain their \nlegal decision-making authority as adults. Even though they remain under court \njurisdiction and child welfare agencies are still in those young adults’ lives, at the \nsuggestion of our legal aid services, we wanted to make clear they have their own \ndecision-making authority. They are 18- to 21-year-olds; at some point, we have to \nlet go and let them make their own decisions. \n \nSection 8 also ensures our young adults, who have either made an initial decision \nnot  to  participate  in  the  plan  of  extended  support  services  or  at  some  point \nbetween the ages of 18 to 21 may have been terminated from that plan for not \nmeeting the requirements, are able to re-establish the plan. If the young adults \nwant to get back into the system, the statute will require the child welfare agency \nor a contracted agency to assist them. In Clark County, we have Step Up offering \nassistance. We may also refer them to the legal aid service agencies that would \nrepresent young adults. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 56 \n \nSection 9 is conforming to the new terms of “young adult” and “extended support \nservices.” \n \nSection  10  creates  the  judicial  review  process  which  is  a  requirement  for  the \nfederal Title IV-E program. This section would provide for notice of the review \nhearing to young adults and the attorney for them. However, it would not require \nthat the young adult attend the review hearing. It also allows for a court to appoint \na panel to conduct the annual review. \n \nA panel would not be in a traditional courtroom setting. Experts would sit around a \ntable talking about ensuring we are providing the correct services, have input from \nthe young adult’s attorney, and that plan would be reviewed for the reasonable \nefforts the agency is providing to support the youth into adulthood. \n \nThis amendment, Exhibit AF, changes the original bill to create one program with \non- and off-ramps for youth aged 18 to 21. When we were 18 to 21 years old, I \nam sure we all had our struggles financially trying to find our way in life and \nreaching out to our parents or family members for help. We want to do the same \nfor children aging out of the foster care system. It is one program that has children \nwho need to be working, going to school or a vocational program and then having \nthat support as they transition to self-sufficiency at the age of 21. \n \nBAILEY BORTOLIN (Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers): \nOur program, Step Up, the contracted team that works through the County, works \nwell, is something we are proud of and makes a big difference in children’s lives. \n \nAs Senator Ohrenschall mentioned, this started in 2011 before there was a federal \noption to extend foster care. States are doing this in a wide variety of models, and \nwe have looked at those models. Nevada should be proud of what it has been \ndoing and the service work provided to these children when they turn 18 years old. \n \nWe have worked hard to make sure we can draw down that 35 percent match \nfrom the Title IV-E funds and not jeopardize what we are doing to serve these \nchildren. It is our intent to continue to do this work. There are some improvements \nin this bill to the way the structure worked previously. Not every child who reaches \nthe age of 18 wants to sign up to stay in the foster care system and continue to \nreceive help. They may regret that choice, and right now they do not have the \noption to come back if they walk away. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 57 \n \nRespect language in the bill ensures we are treating these children as young adults, \nrespecting their autonomy and assisting them to the best of our abilities. This has \nbeen a team effort, but we have something that has been thoroughly thought \nthrough. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIf we set aside Title IV-E funds shifting to this program, is this better for our \nchildren than the one we now run? \n \nTIMOTHY BURCH (Administrator of Human Services, Department of Family Services, \nClark County): \nWe do believe it is because of the on- and off-ramp modality mentioned earlier, as \nwell as what would fully round out what we are calling extended youth support \nservices. This does allow us to provide more types of services because of the \nreinvestment of the Title IV-E dollars. Youth from the Children’s Advocacy Alliance \nwho toured during the last Legislative Session testified about how they wished \nthey would have had the instructed support at 19 and 20 years old after they had \nmade the decision not to engage in the program. We feel this meets that goal for \nthem. \n \nDASHUN JACKSON (Children’s Advocacy Alliance): \nThe Children’s Advocacy Alliance supports S.B. 397. For many youth and young \npeople entering the foster care system, additional support and guidance is needed \nto ensure the success of transitioning into adulthood. This bill would allow many of \nthe  young  people  who  enter  the  system  at  no  fault  of  their  own  to  gain  the \nadditional support. \n \nMany young people who age out of the foster care system are left without family \nand a strong support system to rely on. This bill will give them the additional time \nto find and develop a support system to help them avoid homelessness or entering \ninto the correctional system. \n \nYoung people who have experienced foster care are like many of us who were not \nready to enter the adult world at the age of 18. If we were not ready, why would \nwe expect them to be at 18 years old after having faced traumatic life adversities? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 58 \n \nAMBER HOWELL (Washoe County): \nWashoe County is in the neutral position on S.B. 397 due to the impact of the \nfiscal note. We appreciate the work done to get to the conceptual amendment, \nExhibit AF. \n \nKATHRYN ROOSE (Deputy Administrator, Quality and Oversight, Division of Child and \nFamily Services, Department of Health and Human Services): \nThe Division of Child and Family Services is in the neutral position on S.B. 397. We \nlike having one program, doing what is best for the young adults aging out of the \nfoster  care  system  and  look  forward  to  continuing  to  work  with \nSenator Ohrenschall and the stakeholders. \n \nSENATOR OHRENSCHALL: \nI will read from my closing statement, Exhibit AE. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will entertain a motion on S.B. 397. \n \nSENATOR  HARRIS  MOVED  TO  AMEND  AND  DO  PASS  AS  AMENDED \nS.B. 397. \n \nSENATOR HARDY SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 397. I asked our Counsel to look into the federal \nauthorization to raise the rates in S.B. 390 and if we would be able to pull in \nlandlines as was requested in some of our public testimony this afternoon. \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nThe current language of the bill is based on a federal law and what federal law \nauthorizes in terms of a surcharge. Federal law only authorizes the surcharge on \nmobile lines, but it appears this is to get around a preemption issue that would \notherwise  prevent  states  from  imposing  a  surcharge  on  mobile  lines.  That \npreemption issue is not applicable to landlines as far as I can tell. It does seem it \nwould work to expand the surcharge to landlines. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 59 \n \nTo clarify, are we including the amendment we spoke about earlier in the vote? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nYes. The motion I am looking for on S.B. 390 is amend and do pass to include \nexpanding the lines to be included in the surcharge to landlines. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN MOVED TO AMEND AND DO PASS AS AMENDED \nS.B. 390. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRemainder of page intentionally left blank, signature page to follow.   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 60 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSeeing no public comment, the meeting is adjourned at 8:37 p.m. \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nVickie Polzien, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 61 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nBegins \nExhibit \nBill   on  Witness / Entity  Description \nLetter \nPage \n  A  1    Agenda \nS.B. 201  B  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 274  C  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 275  D  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 309  E  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 318  F  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 326  G  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 329  H  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 340  I  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 380  J  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 391  K  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 396  L  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 376  M  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nAttorney General / \nS.B. 390  N  1  Conceptual Amendment \nAaron Ford  \nAttorney General /  Principles for the Use of \nS.B. 390  O  1 \nAaron Ford   Funds from Opioid Litigation \nStephanie Woodard / \nDivision of Public and \nS.B. 390  P  1  Behavioral Health,  988 Presentation \nDepartment of Health \nand Human Services \nS.B. 390  Q  1  Robin Reedy / NAMI  Support Statement \nMary Walker / Carson \nCity; Douglas County;  Support Statement of Alan \nS.B. 390  R  1 \nCarson Tahoe Health  Garrett / Carson Tahoe Health \nSystem \nGerard Keegan / Cellular \nS.B. 390  S  1  Neutral Statement \nTelecommunications \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 62 \n \nand Internet \nAssociation \nSenator James A. \nS.B. 325  T  1  Proposed Amendment \nSettelmeyer  \nLiz MacMenamin / \nPre-exposure Prophylaxis \nS.B. 325  U  1  Retail Association of \nArticles \nNevada  \nLiz MacMenamin /  Secondary HIV Prevention by \nS.B. 325  V  1  Retail Association of  U.S. Department of Veterans \nNevada   Affairs \nLiz MacMenamin / \nS.B. 325  W   1  Retail Association of  State Information \nNevada  \nJohn “Rob” Phoenix / \nS.B. 325  X  1  Support Testimony \nHuntridge Family Clinic \nS.B. 325  Y  1  Leana Ramirez  Support Testimony \nKenneth Kunke / \nS.B. 325  Z  1  Nevada Pharmacy  Support Testimony \nAlliance \nS.B. 341  AA  1  Senator Pat Spearman   Conceptual Amendment \nFranco Reyna / National \nS.B. 341  AB  1  Support Statement \nKidney Foundation \nCindy Vallette / \nS.B. 341  AC  1  Support Statement \nAmerican Kidney Fund \nTina Dortch / Office of \nS.B. 341  AD  1  Minority Health and  Neutral Testimony \nEquity \nSenator James \nS.B. 397  AE  1  Written Remarks \nOhrenschall  \nSenator James \nS.B. 397  AF  1  Proposed Amendment \nOhrenschall  \n ", "60": "\nMINUTES OF THE  \nSENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n \nEighty-first Session \nFebruary 4, 2021 \n \n \nThe Senate Committee on Health and Human Services was called to order by \nChair Julia Ratti at 3:31 p.m. on Thursday, February 4, 2021, Online.

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic and for the safety of our \nstaff, legislators, and the public, the building is currently closed for any physical \nattendance. We have worked hard to ensure there are various opportunities for \nthe public to participate with our Committee and be sure we get their input.  \n \nAll committee information is available on the Nevada Legislature Website, the \nNevada Electronic Legislative Information System (NELIS). There is also a Help \nlink that provides information on how to participate in the meetings by either \ntestifying,  submitting  written  testimony  or  exhibits,  sharing  your  opinion \nthrough the application on NELIS, and watching the meetings either through the \nWebsite or on the YouTube channel. \n \nI will entertain a motion to adopt the Senate Committee on Health and Human \nServices Rules for the 2021 Session (Exhibit B).  \n \nSENATOR HARDY MOVED TO ADOPT THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON \nHEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES RULES FOR THE 2021 SESSION AS \nSUBMITTED. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \n  THE  MOTION  CARRIED.  (SENATOR  SPEARMAN  WAS  EXCUSED  FOR \nTHE VOTE.) \n \n* * * * * \n \nI want to note for the public and members of this Committee; typically, we have \nabout two weeks of introductory presentations from the Department of Health \nand Human Services (DHHS) to establish a baseline understanding about DHHS \nand its divisions. Given that we have a relatively tenured Committee, we will \nnot  do  those  basic  agency  presentations  in  this  Committee.  The  Assembly \nCommittee on Health and Human Services, which does have new members, will \nbe hearing those presentations. If the public or a member of this Committee \nwish  to  view  those  presentations,  they  can  watch  them  at  the  Assembly \nCommittee on Health and Human Services meetings. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 4, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nThe only presentation before this Committee is the Cannabis Compliance Board \nbecause we are new to this area. \n \nTYLER KLIMAS (Executive Director, Nevada Cannabis Compliance Board): \nI will provide an overview of the Nevada Cannabis Compliance Board (CCB). My \ntestimony will address how this agency has operated over the past 12 months. I \nwill read from my written testimony, (Exhibit C) pages 1 through 3. \n \nI will now present, the Nevada Cannabis Compliance Board Agency Overview \n(Exhibit D) on slides 1 through 19. I will be reading from my written testimony, \nExhibit C, pages 3 through 9. \n \nLast  Session,  there  was  considerable  discussion  on  cannabis  consumption \nlounges contained in A.B. No. 533 of the 80th Session. The CCB was required \nto submit a report on these lounges to the Legislature by January 1, 2021.  I \nincluded that report as supplemental material for the Committee, the Study on \nNevada Cannabis Consumption Lounges (Exhibit E). \n \nI can answer any questions and then will move on to Senate Bill (S.B.) 49. \n \nSENATE BILL 49: Revises provisions relating to cannabis. (BDR 56-268) \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI had misgivings about the Cannabis Compliance Board, but I have been very \nimpressed with Mr. Klimas's presentation and appreciate the work the CCB has \ndone. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe will now open the hearing on S.B. 49. \n \nMR. KLIMAS: \nThe CCB is presenting S.B. 49, which is our only bill this Session. It is primarily \nhousekeeping  and  clarifying  language  and  includes  the  CCB  proposed \namendment (Exhibit F). My staff will give a presentation on S.B. 49 (Exhibit G). \n  \nMICHAEL MILES (Deputy Director, Nevada Cannabis Compliance Board): \nI will be discussing section 1 of S.B. 49 that requests the removal of Nevada \nRevised Statute (NRS) 678A.530, subsection 2, which addresses depositions as \n   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 4, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nset out on page 3 of Exhibit G. My written testimony begins on page 9 through \npage 10 of Exhibit C. I will also be discussing the proposed CCB amendment to \nS.B. 49, Exhibit F. \n \nDAVID  STALEY  (Chief  Compliance/Audit  Investigator,  Nevada  Cannabis \nCompliance Board): \nI will be discussing section 2 of S.B. 49 that requests additional language be \nincluded in NRS 678B.340 as set out in Exhibit G, page 4. My written testimony \nis on page 10 of Exhibit C. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI am not sure what this does with regard to the 5 percent rule.  Does it allow \npeople to potentially get out of being identified as an owner, volunteer or under \na contract as it pertains to less than 5 percent ownership? What are you looking \nto do that is new and different than before? \n \nMR. STALEY: \nThe request for additional language does not provide for anything new. We felt \nthere  could  be  potential  confusion  because  the  language  provided  in \nNRS 678B.340 was used by the CCB to craft the waiver regulations we have in \nplace.  We  are  moving  that  language  from  NRS  678A.450,  duplicating  and \nputting  it  in  NRS  678B.340  to  clarify  the  CCB  has  the  opportunity  to \npromulgate  regulations  that  provide  the  ability  to  waive  the  requirement  for \nagent cards for individuals with less than 5 percent ownership.  \n \nThe NRS provides that anyone with ownership interest and that could include \none  single  share  of  a  company  or  1  percent  of  ownership,  our  regulations \nrequire a background investigation. They receive an agent card registering them \nwith the CCB for their ownership of the company. Most companies have four or \nfive different owners. It is not a burdensome process for us or the industry to \nconduct the background investigation on all those individuals. \n \nThe various publicly traded companies and some of the private companies have \nmany investors who have no control or involvement in the operations of the \ncannabis establishment. For instance, we have closely held private companies \nwherein one of the owners gave his or her share to someone in the family. That \nperson has no involvement in the running of the cannabis establishment. The \nCovid-19 issues make it difficult for anyone to get their fingerprints taken or \nhave a background check performed.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 4, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nFollowing the gaming model, one of the premises we have identified is the \nconcept  of  controls  being  important  with  all  of  our  different  cannabis \nestablishments and licensees. If a company initially requests a waiver according \nto Nevada Cannabis Compliance Regulations (NCCR) 5.112 or NCCR 5.125 and \nprovides information it has less than 5 percent shareholders and is not involved \nin control or operation of the company, it gives CCB leeway to allow those \nindividuals not to go through the agent card process. \n \nFor  a  publicly  traded  company  that  has  thousands  of  shareholders,  such  a \nrequirement is onerous and restricts the ability of that company to have its \nshares traded on a daily basis. Without the waiver, someone who wanted to \nbuy ten shares of that company today and sell them tomorrow would not be \nable  to  because  our  regulations  would  normally  require  their  licensure.  The \nproposed language does not eliminate our regulations that require individuals in \na control position who have shares or even no shares to file an application for a \ncannabis  executive  card.  A  chief  executive  officer,  chief  financial  officer, \nchairman of the board of directors, or any other individual who can exercise \ncontrol in the company's operations or participate in the profits of a marijuana \ncompany, are required to be found suitable and obtain an executive agent card \neven if they have no ownership in the company.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY:  \nWhat waivers exist now and what are the changes? \n \nMR. STALEY: \nThe waivers already exist under NCCR 5.112 and 5.125 and were promulgated \nbased on the ability provided to the CCB under NRS 678A.450. We are not \nadding any new regulations  or anything new to the statute. We are simply \nduplicating the language already in statute and  moving it to areas where it \nclarifies any questions there may be under NRS 678B.340. We already have the \nwaivers in place that were approved by the CCB at its July 21, 2020 meeting. \nThe CCB has approved waivers both for individuals on closely held companies \nand larger numbers of shareholders for publicly traded companies.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWhat will happen to the individual family member who was given one share? \n  \n   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 4, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nMR. STALEY: \nNothing will happen unless the company first applies for a waiver. The individual \nwe discussed is required to submit fingerprints and go through our background \ninvestigation to get an agent card even though he or she has never been to the \ncultivation production site. If a company submits an application for a waiver \nunder NCCR 5.112 or NCCR 5.125 and is able to provide sufficient evidence \nthat a shareholder has no involvement or control over the operations of the \ncannabis establishment, the CCB can approve the waiver. The individual then \ndoes not need to get an agent card or submit fingerprints for a background \ninvestigation because the individual has no ability to influence the operations of \nthe  cannabis  establishment.  We  look  closely  at  the  concept  of  control  and \nability for someone to be involved in control that would not be suitable under \nthe requirements of our regulations and statutes. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIf an individual had a 1 percent ownership and that individual's family members \nequally had 1 percent, this regulation would allow each one of them not to be \nfingerprinted  or  investigated.  By  the  time  each  of  them  had  1  percent \ncollectively, they would have a controlling interest and would have control. \n \nMR. STALEY: \nYour  question  provides  evidence  of  control.  We  would  look  at  familial \nownership, ownership from a spouse or through a family, as just mentioned. If \nthe amount of ownership indicated they could exercise a certain amount of \ncontrol over the operations, then the CCB would likely determine such a waiver \nwas  not  appropriate.  Through  ongoing  audits  and  investigations  performed \nduring a transfer of interest, our investigators and agents are looking for hidden \nownership or people who may be exerting control that do not have an agent \ncard. I would expect anyone exerting any significant control over the operations \nof a company, and both exist within the statutes and regulations, to call them \nforward at the CCB's discretion even if a waiver is in place. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nHave you already come across this situation? \n \nMR. STALEY: \nNo, we have not. The CCB has approved seven or eight waivers at this point. In \nall  cases,  the  companies  provided  us  with  information  indicating  either  the \nindividual or group of individuals they were waiving did not have an element of \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 4, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \ncontrol over the company. The agent's independent review of company records \nincludes  asking  the  company  to  provide  further  information,  including \ndisclosures  included  in  their  audited  financial  statements  with  the  Canadian \nSecurities  Exchange  (CSE)  or  the  U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission \n(SEC). The agents tested the attestations of the licensee and were able to find it \ndid not appear any of the individuals that would be affected by that waiver \nwould have any level of control which would have necessitated an agent card. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIf you depend on the company to tell you things and you investigate based on \nwhat they tell you, what are the consequences if the company lies to you, and \nthey did have some control? \n \nMR. STALEY: \nA  question  of  consequences  would  go  to  the  CCB  members,  who  are  the \nindividuals  that  make  those  decisions.  If  we  determined  that  there  were \nindividuals in a control position and had tried to circumvent our agent card \nrequirements, we would identify the circumstances. We would do a personal \ninterview  with  them  and  the  other  executives.  The  CCB  would  receive  the \ninformation  under  an  areas  of  concern  section  in  our  investigative  report  in \nwhich  we  would  lay  out  all  the  facts  that  were  ascertained.  It  would  not \nsurprise me where an individual exerted a level of control without submitting the \nagent  card  application.  What  would  surprise  me  is  if  they  did  so  with  the \nexpress intent to circumvent our requirements. I would initially expect it would \nbe  a  communication  problem  or  mistake;  however,  we  would  allow  the \ncompany an opportunity to address our areas of concern. If we were able to \ndetermine  it  was  done  specifically  to  circumvent  our  regulatory  structure, \nknowing the CCB, there would be a wide range of public and difficult penalties \nassessed against that company. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nCould the company then lose its license? \n \nMR. STALEY: \nYes. Our statutes provide that the CCB has a wide range of penalties it can \nassess against those companies, up to and including the revocation of their \nlicense. \n \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 4, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI understand this amendment is generally a clarification of language. What about \na publicly held corporation where a person technically has an ownership interest \nbecause they are a stockholder and do not have control. How do you decide if a \nlarge publicly held corporation has to have this kind of screening? \n \nMR. STALEY: \nPublicly traded companies, both in the CSE and SEC, have certain reporting \nrequirements. They have to make public disclosures annually, and individuals \nhave  to  make  disclosures  when  they  acquire  certain  levels  of  shares.  The \nstatutes  provide  an  under  5  percent  threshold  and  a  5  percent  and  over \nthreshold. According to regulation, the waivers we have adopted allow us to \nwaive the requirement that an under 5 percent individual may assess the waiver \nif they prove they are not in a control position. Anyone 5 percent or over is \nrequired to get a cannabis executive card and we do not have the ability to \nwaive that requirement for them. \n \nIn a large publicly traded company, a 5 percent position would be a significant \nposition and is uncommon. A 5 percent position may not give them control, in \nthe case of an institutional investor who may not want to disclose that it is for \ninvestment purposes only and will not be exerting any control. The 5 percent \nthreshold  has  been  determined  by  statute.  We  automatically  assume  that \nbecause  the  potential  of  a  controlling  or  influencing  position  exists  at  a \n5 percent threshold or above, any individual or company with an ownership of \n5 percent or above is required to get an agent card. The CCB can call that \ncompany forward if they conclude that it should be licensed like an owner or \nlicensure as an acquisition control. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIf I am in a retirement system that has a 5 percent ownership, how do you \nprovide me with a card? \n \nMR. STALEY: \nIn the case of a large institutional investor of investment funds or other entities \nthat  have  pooled  the  investment  ability  of  many,  none  of  the  individual \nshareholders or participants of the investments guaranteed by the fund have any \ncontrol of their investment or of the activities of the fund itself. In the case of a \nfund or investment company that operates a couple of different funds, they will \nhave  fund  managers  or  have  executives  identified  that  manage  or  run  the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 4, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \ninvesting activities of the company and are responsible for those investments. If \nthat is the case, they are identified by the company for us, and we require that \nthe fund or institutional investors provide us with an understanding of how \ndecisions  are  made  for  the  fund  and  the  individuals  that  can  make  those \ndecisions are required to have an agent card. \n \nThese concepts mirror the best practices of the Nevada Gaming Control Board. \nWhile our statutes and regulations are not as detailed or far reaching, it was \nimportant  that  we  look  to  the  premises  and  concepts  of  control  and  basic \npremises of regulations by the Board, take those best practices, and use them \nfor the cannabis industry. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAre you saying the practices mirror the gaming industry, but the statutory or \nregulatory framework does not? \n \nMR. STALEY: \nOur regulatory framework does mirror gaming though it is not as expansive. The \nBoard has separate regulations for limited liability companies, corporations and \npublicly traded companies. When we crafted our regulations pursuant to statute, \nwe did not lay out the specific delineations as the different types of companies. \nInstead,  we  went  to  the  core  concept  of  control  over  the  operations  of  a \ncannabis establishment. \n \nSTEVE  GILBERT  (Marijuana  Program  Manager,  Nevada  Cannabis  Compliance \nBoard): \nSection 3 of S.B. 49 cleans up language in NRS 678B.520 and helps address \nconsistent labeling of products as set forth on page 5 of Exhibit G. I will read \nfrom my written testimony on bottom of pages 10 and 11 of Exhibit C. \n  \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI have a question about existing stock and if it grandfathers in anything that has \nbeen produced within a certain time frame. How are you working through the \ntransition of existing labels? \n \nMR. GILBERT: \nWe are allowing the industry to work through the existing labels. We will be \nlooking at their time frame to work through those labels, whether the labels \nhave been approved and if the packaging must change. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 4, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDo you see that happening through a regulatory process where it is clear what \nthe cut-off date is for using those labels? \n \nMR. GILBERT: \nThat will be guidance that is given from the CCB to the industry.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIt seems like the CCB has more flexibility to get things done than perhaps some \nother agencies with whom we are accustomed to dealing. There might need to \nbe more clarity in either the NRS or the Nevada Administrative Code. Am I \nreading that wrong? \n \nMR. GILBERT: \nWe are in the process of looking at the regulations and potential upcoming \nworkshops to go over the packaging labels and guidelines. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nYou are basically on the record saying that if people have existing stock they \nwill be able to use that stock? \n \nMR. GILBERT: \nYes. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nBy removing the difference in labeling to medical cannabis and regular cannabis \nproducts, would this inhibit police enforcement's ability to know if someone has \na medical product even if they do not have a medical card? \n \nMR. GILBERT: \nNo, it would not. Cannabis is cultivated and labeled up to the point of sale. It is \nlabeled as a single source and that product is designated as medical at that \npoint of sale. If a person was questioned on the cannabis they have in their \npossession, they should have their medical marijuana registration card for that \npurpose. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 4, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nIn order for law enforcement to ask the individual to provide a medical card, \nhow would they be able to tell if the marijuana is medical grade? \n \nMR. GILBERT: \nIf the product was medical-grade level, possession limits for medical cannabis \nallowed is two and one-half ounces while possession for non-medical cannabis \nis a one-ounce purchase. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nAm I incorrect in assuming that there are some strains that are allowed to be \nsold as medical but not recreational? \n \nMR. GILBERT: \nYes. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI think clarity on this is essential so we have it on the record. All products that \ncontain cannabis can be used for either adult or medical use, but there are a \nsmall subsection of products that can only be used for medical use because of \nthe concentration within that product. Is that correct? \n \nMR. GILBERT: \nYes.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAre the higher concentration products only sold for medical use? The rest of it is \na matter of taxation; whether or not you pay the extra 10 percent? \n \nMR. GILBERT: \nThat is correct. \n \nMR. KLIMAS: \nI will go through the amendment, Exhibit F, which includes language to provide \nadditional flexibility to extend the 45-day requirement for the CCB to hold a \nhearing  after  a  licensee  answers  a  complaint.  In  some  cases,  especially  in \ncomplicated disciplinary matters, 45 days is not enough time for either side to \ngather the resources to hold an appropriate hearing. The aim will always be to \nmove expeditiously through these hearings and complaints. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 4, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nThis amendment allows for a request to be made to the CCB Chair for approval \nof an extension of the 45-day hearing requirement. Section 2 simplifies the \nprocess  for  serving  complaints  against  a  licensee.  The  way  the  statute  is \nwritten, the CCB has to vote blindly on approving service of a complaint that \nshould be a procedural matter. They do not get to see the complaint or know \nwho the complaint is filed against; they just know that the CCB and the Office \nof the Attorney General recommended that it be filed. It becomes an onerous \nprocess that is not a good use of staff or their time. The CCB Chair and board \nmembers made this point known at our first meeting. \n \nThis  amendment  allows  the  Executive  Director  of  the  CCB  to  serve  the \ncomplaint  and  does  not  change  any  part  of  the  process.  Section  3  of  the \namendment  allows  the  CCB  to  employ  additional  services  to  assist  in \ndisciplinary proceedings when necessary. This is a part-time Board that needs to \nutilize services of an administrative law judge in certain disciplinary matters. \nThis keeps the hearing process moving and is critical to allow for an appropriate \npace in its oversight responsibilities. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nI have a question about the extension of the 45-day hearing requirement. Can \nyou tell me about why you chose to give the CCB the ability to extend that \nindefinitely as opposed to giving yourselves more time? Instead of 45 days, why \nnot change it to 90 days or 120 days? \n \nMR. KLIMAS: \nThe goal is to always move quickly within the 45 days. We thought allowing \n90 to 120 days to the process would further delay the hearing. We have cases \ntwo years old we inherited. We want to keep the hearings on a tight schedule. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nWould you be willing to consider putting constraints on the CCB so people \nknow they have the right to have their cases heard within a certain time period. \nIf extensions can be continually granted, then it will never be known how long it \nmight take and there is no further guarantee. The 45 days becomes irrelevant. \n \nMR. KLIMAS: \nI understand what you are saying and we can look into adding some guidelines. \nIf someone applies for an extension, and the Chair grants a certain amount of \ntime, the option would be to continually grant an extension. I do not think that \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 4, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nwould be the intent and would not work out well for the CCB, staff or licensee. \nI would hope that practice would not be common. I can tell you that I, as Chair, \nwould not make it a common practice. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe are going to want to get clarity on this issue. The CCB or staff would not \nrequest an extension, the request for an extension would only come from the \npetitioners, correct? \n \nMR. KLIMAS: \nThe  request  for  an  extension  would  come  from  either  our  deputy  attorney \ngenerals or the licensee. \n \nMARLA MCDADE WILLIAMS (Strategy 360): \nI will read from my written testimony in opposition to S.B. 49, (Exhibit H). \n \nSTEVEN COHEN: \nI  am  testifying  neutral  to  S.B.  49.  The  issue  of  jurisdictions  in  legalizing \ncannabis,  while  being  federally  illegal,  creates  a  policy  concern  when  State \nagencies are primarily federally funded. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will now close the hearing on S.B. 49. \n \nMONA LISA SAMUELSON: \nI represent medical cannabis patients living in Nevada and we want you to know \nthat medical patients are very pleased the issue of cannabis has moved from the \nJudiciary Committee to the Health and Human Services Committee. \n \n \n   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 4, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe Senate Committee on Health and  Human Services Committee Brief has \nbeen submitted (Exhibit I). \n \nThis meeting is adjourned at 5:04 p.m. \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n   \nNorma Mallett, \nCommittee Secretary \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \nDATE:   \n   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 4, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nExhibit  Begins \nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \nLetter  on Page \n  A  1    Agenda \n  B  1  Senator Julia Ratti  Committee Rules \nTyler Klimas / Nevada \n  C  1  Cannabis Compliance  Written Testimony \nBoard \nMichael Miles / Nevada \n  C  9  Cannabis Compliance  Written Testimony \nBoard \nDavid Staley / Nevada \n  C  10  Cannabis Compliance  Written Testimony \nBoard \nSteve Gilbert / Nevada \n  C  10  Cannabis Compliance  Written Testimony \nBoard \nTyler Klimas / Nevada \n  D  1  Cannabis Compliance  Board Agency Overview \nBoard \n  Tyler Klimas / Nevada \nStudy on Nevada Cannabis \n  E  1  Cannabis Compliance \nConsumption Lounges \n  Board \nTyler Klimas / Nevada \nS.B. 49  F  1  Cannabis Compliance  Proposed Amendment \nBoard \nMichael Miles / Nevada \nS.B. 49  F  1  Cannabis Compliance  Proposed Amendment \nBoard \nMichael Miles / Nevada \nS.B. 49  G  1  Cannabis Compliance  Presentation on S.B. 49 \nBoard \nDavid Staley / Nevada \nS.B. 49  G  4  Cannabis Compliance  Presentation on S.B. 49 \nBoard \nS.B. 49  G  5  Steve Gilbert / Nevada  Presentation on S.B. 49 \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 4, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nCannabis Compliance \nBoard \nTyler Klimas / Nevada \nS.B. 49  G  6  Cannabis Compliance  Presentation on S.B. 49 \nBoard \nMarla McDade Williams \nS.B. 49  H  1  Written Testimony \n/ Strategies 360 \n  I  1  Senator Julia Ratti  Committee Brief \n ", "61": "\nMINUTES OF THE  \nSENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n \nEighty-first Session \nFebruary 9, 2021 \n \n \nThe Senate Committee on Health and Human Services was called to order by \nChair Julia Ratti at 3:34 p.m. on Tuesday, February 9, 2021, Online.

(BDR 39-431) \n \nDOROTHY EDWARDS (Behavioral Health Coordinator, Washoe Regional Behavioral \nHealth Policy Board, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, Department \nof Health and Human Services): \nI will read from my written testimony (Exhibit B). \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 9, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nCHAIR RATTI:  \nThere are four one-page summaries with helpful information on each of the bill \ncomponents  submitted  as  exhibits  by  Washoe  Regional  Behavioral  Health \n(Exhibit C, Exhibit D, Exhibit E and Exhibit F). \n \nSEAN O’DONNELL (Executive Director, Foundation for Recovery): \nI will read from my written presentation (Exhibit G) to present S.B. 69. \n \nNATALIE POWELL (Director, Nevada Certification Board): \nI will provide a brief history of the Nevada Certification Board (NCB) (Exhibit H) \nand read from my written presentation (Exhibit I). \n \nStates  may  maintain  up  to  two  International  Certification  & Reciprocity \nConsortium  (IC&RC)  Boards  if  needed.  These  boards  can  license  or  certify \nbehavioral health service providers in prevention, treatment and recovery.  \n \nThe NCB was granted permission to apply to IC&RC by the State Board of \nExaminers for drug, alcohol and gambling counselors. In 2016, we received \npermission to be a secondary board and were accepted into the IC&RC.  \n \nOur  task  was  to  provide  a  voluntary  certification  process  for  peer  recovery \nsupport and prevention specialists that would meet or exceed IC&RC standards.  \n \nIn 2018, the NCB was asked by the Division of Public and Behavioral Health to \nprovide a similar voluntary certification process for community health workers. \nWe now provide voluntary certification for three occupations in community and \nbehavioral health.  \n \nIn terms  of our mission, vision and the importance of certification, refer to \nExhibit I for contact information and links to the NCB and IC&RC websites. \n \nIn 2017, we held an IC&RC-endorsed pilot or grandfathering period for our peer \nspecialist  certification  process.  The  purpose  of  the  pilot  was  to  allow \ncertification for peer specialists already working in the field and well established, \nand work out any issues in our certification process.  \n \nDuring the pilot period, we certified 59 peer recovery and support specialists. \nSince this pilot, we have certified an additional 91 peers, making a total of \n150 specialists working in the State. Additionally, we have 242 peers who have \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 9, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nstarted the application process with the NCB. The application process can take \nup to a year to complete. Applications consist of proof of a high school diploma \nor  equivalency,  and  a  minimum  of  46  hours  of  State-approved  specialized \ntraining in IC&RC peer domains. \n  \nOur two State-approved training organizations are Foundation for Recovery and \nthe  Center  for  the  Application  of  Substance  Abuse  Technologies,  at  the \nUniversity of Nevada, Reno.  \n \nAlso required are 500 hours of supervised experience in those peer domains and \npassing the IC&RC peer recovery examination. To be a certified peer recovery \nspecialist,  you  need  lived  experience  in  substance  abuse,  mental  health  or \nprocess addiction, along with a required minimum of two years in recovery. We \nwant people to be stable so they can help others. The IC&RC peer domains \nrequire demonstration in proficiency and include advocacy, ethical responsibility, \nmentoring in education and recovery and wellness support. \n \nLINDA LANG (Director, Nevada Statewide Coalition Partnership): \nI will read from written testimony (Exhibit J). \n \nCHAIR RATTI:  \nThere is a proposed conceptual amendment to S.B. 69 (Exhibit K) under my \nname. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nMr.  O’Donnell,  is  there  a  section  that  pertains  to  applicability  related  to \ncompensation, such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) sponsors? \n \nMR. O’DONNELL: \nWhat  I  presented  included  the  conceptual  amendment  which  made  the \nclarification that certification would apply to those using those titles or those \ncompensated to provide these services.  \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nAre these services billable under Medicaid or commercial insurance, and is State \nMedicaid billing for them now?  \n \nMR. O’DONNELL: \nYes. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 9, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIs certification a qualification for billing services? If one is not certified, can they \nbill for services? \n \nMR. O’DONNELL: \nTo my knowledge, certification is not required to bill for services. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nMs.  Powell,  is  a  high  school  diploma  or  equivalency  required  to  become \ncertified? \n \nMS. POWELL: \nA high school diploma or equivalency is required for each of our certifications.  \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nAs this is specifically outlined as nonclinical and lived experience, why should \nthat be a requirement and possible barrier? \n \nMS. POWELL: \nIt is a requirement of the IC&RC and an international requirement we subscribe \nto. We wanted to standardize the process and are happy to help with the GED \nprocess if that is a barrier.  \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nMs. Lang, is the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) individually \nidentifiable or aggregated? \n \nMS. LANG: \nNo, that is the reason for the minimum required response rate of 60 percent. \nExhibit F shows the response rates across the various counties and how close \nwe are to not reaching that 60 percent. We cannot go through individual school \ndistricts much lower than 60 percent before the data can be identified. The \nschool districts that participate can receive this data and use it as they wish. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nOn an aggregated basis, not with the individual identifiable information, correct? \n \nMS. LANG: \nCorrect, no individual information. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 9, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nMs. Powell, why is lived experience important? \n \nMR. O’DONNELL: \nLived experience for peer recovery support specialists is the crux of what makes \nthese services work. I have training in learned experience of confidentiality, \ntools for  motivational interviewing, advocacy and mentorship.  This could be \nlearned in a class setting; however, as a peer recovery support specialist with \nlived  experience  in  incarceration  or  homelessness,  one  could  relate  to  an \nindividual removing the power differential. A peer recovery support specialist is \nseen as a peer having had similar life experiences who can help to navigate \nsystems  and  rebuild  a  life  relating  to  one  another  because  of  those  lived \nexperiences. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nCultural competency was a topic discussed last Session. Speaking with people \nwho understand where you are and what you have been through and the power \ndifferential, there would be no judgement, correct? \n \nMR. O’DONNELL: \nYes. A great example of that is the concept of matching someone in need of \nhelp with someone experiencing similar circumstances. If someone is seeking \npeer  recovery  support,  you  would  attempt  to  match  them  with  a  specialist \nbased  on  those  same  experiences.  As  a  member  of  the  LGBTQ  community \nmyself, it may be more beneficial to work directly with other members of that \ncommunity as they are able to relate with their experiences.  \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nIt  is  important  to  speak  with  someone  having  that  lived  experience  and \ncredibility within your community and have them represent those communities \npresent in Nevada. \n \nSenate Bill No. 204 of the 80th Session pertaining to suicide prevention had \nelements suggesting a nexus between what you are doing and what the school \nsystem  is  attempting.  Ms.  Lang,  I  would  like  to  speak  with  you  offline  to \ncollaborate to boost support for your program. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 9, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nMS. LANG: \nI would be happy to meet with you offline and will reach out to you. I am \nfamiliar with that bill and the report required. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nWe have had many suicides in Clark County, and we need to do better with \nthat. Some elements would be very helpful if implemented with what you are \nsuggesting.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \n“For the record, the bill would include peer experiences in behavioral health as \nmuch  as  substance  abuse  disorder.”  The  provisions  in  this  bill  around \nevidence-based prevention are based on S.B. No. 204 of the 80th Session. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI am unsure of the difference between the 46 hours versus the 500 hours of \nsupervised experience. Is tuition required for the 500 hours, and are applicants \nable to be peer recovery specialists while waiting for certification? What is the \nprocess for certification? \n \nMS. POWELL: \nThe 46 hours of instruction are classroom hours in advocacy, mentoring and \neducation,  recovery  and  wellness  support,  and  ethical  responsibility.  It  is \nweighted more heavily toward ethical responsibility. \n \nThe 500 hours are supervised experience working in the IC&RC peer domains. I \ncan provide the matrix of the tasks pertaining to these domains if necessary. \nThe IC&RC is a resource for us. They complete a job analysis of certifications \nand credentials every five to seven years. They have nationwide or international \nsubject matter experts researching this field and updating the examinations in \nkeeping with best evidence-based practices.  \n \nTraditionally, peers are eligible for hire by agencies prior to certification. We \nhave advisory committees for each certification made up of those in the field \nwho  are  subject  matter  experts.  Previously,  peers  felt  there  was  sufficient \nemployment available to have people perform these supervised hours before \nbecoming certified. As the proposed amendment, Exhibit K, shows, we will be \nproviding for the possibility of an internship. Interns could complete those hours \nby  either  volunteering  or  mentoring.  Many  agencies  will  pay  peers  for  this \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 9, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nexperience. We have not had any issue with peers finding paid or volunteer \npositions to accomplish those hours.  \n \nThere is a differentiation between an AA sponsor and a peer recovery support \nspecialist. We are not able to take peer experience working as a sponsor or with \nAA or Narcotics Anonymous (NA) group meetings and 12-step programs.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe concept of interns theoretically gives people a chance to pay tuition or have \nremuneration  while  working  toward  their  certifications  in  order  to  support \nthemselves during those 500 hours. With two years of sobriety and working in \nthe community, there is a step down in the level of living. An internship also \nprovides the possibility of an income. \n \nMS. POWELL: \nIn practice, that is happening. This peer recovery support specialist position is \nseen  as  the  beginning  of  a  clear  career  ladder.  Many  move  on  to  become \nlicensed counselors and social workers. It is an entry-level start, but they would \nbe making as much as peers in any position they previously or currently hold.  \n \nWe charge $165 to initially certify, $80 of which covers the test given by \nIC&RC, and the remaining goes to processing. Most peers have agencies that \nwill cover this cost. This certifies them for 2 years, and within that 2 years, the \nrenewal obligations are to complete 20 additional hours of continued education \nunits. Six of those hours must be in ethics to keep that in the forefront, and the \nremaining 14 hours are anything within the other IC&RC peer domains. The \nrenewal fee is $100. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWould  this  make  it  illegal  for  peers  to  work  in  the  community  without \ncertification? \n \nMS. POWELL: \nThere  is  a  grandfathering  period  giving  an  applicant  until  2023  to  become \ncertified as a recovering intern or a certified peer recovery support specialist. \nThere are allowances for those who volunteer, specifically for professionals who \nvolunteer as peers, such as lawyers providing legal advice. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 9, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nFor  individuals  practicing  as  peer  recovery  support  specialists  without  being \ncertified by 2023, there is no criminal penalty; there would be a civil penalty, \nand these people would be subject to a fine. If they continue to incur fines, they \ncould be held in contempt of court. At this point, that would be as far as it \nwould go. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIs there a fiscal note? \n \nMS. POWELL: \nThere is no fiscal note at this time, or it has been cleared. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThere have been many amendments to this bill. We will get information about \nthe two-thirds majority vote requirement and the fiscal note as we get closer to \nwork session. \n \n“For  the  record,  the  proposed  amendment  only  includes  those  who  will  be \ncompensated, and that is intentional to exclude AA, NA, any of the 12-step \ngroups and any other volunteer-driven groups supporting folks in recovery.” \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nHow do you know if someone is practicing and has not been certified? Is there \nanything in place to identify those continuing to practice without certification? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIt would be the same process as any other certification and licensing, mostly a \ncomplaint-driven process. \n \nNANCY BOWEN (CEO, Nevada Primary Care Association): \nThe Nevada Primary Care Association supports S.B. 69. Our members work is \naffected by at least two provisions in this bill: the sections dealing with peer \nsupport  specialists  and  the  YRBSS.  Healthcare  centers  have  been  working \ndiligently to expand substance abuse disorder services across the State. State \nand federal investments have encouraged the certification providers be able to \nadminister medication-assisted treatment to expand options for our community. \nPeer  support  specialists  have  benefited  by  the  programs  in  our  healthcare \ncenters.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 9, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nClarifying the definition, scope and responsibilities in Nevada Revised Statutes \n(NRS) will allow this provider type to further develop and produce results. Our \nmembers are reliant on federal grants to provide services to uninsured residents. \nBetween 2015 and 2020, we brought more than $188 million in grant funding \nto Nevada. Securing these grants required current and accurate data. One of the \nmost important data sources we use is the YRBSS. It is critical for Nevada to do \neverything necessary to support the collection of this data. \n \nDON GIBSON (Behavioral Health Peace Officer, Carson City Sheriff’s Office): \nI work full time with mental health clinicians and respond to all community crisis \ncalls  related  to  mental  health.  The  primary  focus  for  my  unit  is  jail  and \nemergency room diversion. My unit supports S.B. 69 and values the support of \nour community coalition, Partnership Carson City. Partnership Carson City is an \ninstrumental stakeholder for the health of our community and proven leader in \nraising  the  quality  of  life  for  individuals  who  suffer  from  mental  illness  and \nsubstance abuse.  \n \nRACHEL DUNFEE (Healthy Communities Coalition): \nI am an LGBTQ junior in Silver City and a Stand Tall prevention program team \nmember who supports S.B. 69. I have been involved with Healthy Communities \nCoalition  (HCC)  as  a  Stand  Tall  member  for  five  years  which  is  a  great \nopportunity for youths to get involved in their community. Stand Tall is a place \nwhere everyone is welcome no matter their past identity, sexual orientation or \nwalk of life. Stand Tall is a wonderful way to be educated on the dangers of \ntobacco, cannabis, e-cigarettes and alcohol in youth.  \n \nPrograms  such  as  Stand  Tall  create  an  open  conversation  for  youths  who \nstruggle with addiction. Diversity is important in these prevention groups as \neveryone has different experiences. We focus on prevention and touch on a \nvariety  of  subjects  from  prevention  to  mindfulness  and  exploring  artistic \nopportunities. This program not only teaches youths about prevention, it helps \nthem teach the rest of the community. Supporting coalitions means supporting \nthe worlds next generation, teaching us values to last a lifetime.  \n \nJOELLE GUTMAN DODSON (Washoe County Health District): \nWashoe County Health District supports S.B. 69. The implementation of peer \nrecovery support specialists in Washoe County is part of the Washoe County \nHealth District’s Community Health Improvement Plan. The certification for peer \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 9, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nrecovery support specialists will ensure a better standard of practice, elevate \nthe workforce, help protect the public and set the standard for employers.  \n \nThe Health District supports an up-to-date and evidence-based curriculum and \nprograms concerning substance misuse and abuse disorders in our schools. We \nare supportive of every school participating in the YRBSS. The more students \nparticipating in this survey, the more accurate data we have to address the \nneeds of Nevada’s youth. \n \nVINCE COLLINS (Director of Operations, The Gay and Lesbian Community Center \nof Southern Nevada): \nThe Gay and Lesbian Community Center of Southern Nevada supports S.B. 69. \nWe are initiating our first substance use and overdose data-to-action programs \nemploying a peer support specialist and need this expertise in launching our \nprogram. Having a baseline standard for peer support adds to our professional \nenvironment for navigating individuals with linkage to care and services. By \ndoing this, we impact the LGBTQ community and the greater community of \nLas Vegas. \n \nMALA WHEATLEY (Director, Pacific Behavioral Health): \nI support S.B. 69. Pacific Behavioral Health provides mental health services to \nrural counties throughout Nevada. Through our partnership with HCC, we have \nsuccessfully  collaborated  with  the  Lyon  County  School  District  to  provide \nmuch-needed, school-based mental health services to students. The Coalition \nhas provided vital communication, relationships and connections, allowing us to \nprovide  mental  health  services  to  our  youth.  The  successful  connections  of \nPacific  Behavioral  Health  with  Lyon  County  students  is  evidence  of  the \ncollaborative  efforts  of  the  HCC  and  serves  as  a  catalyst  for  community \nconnections. We have served over 100 students this year and were successful \nin stabilizing them in their homes and schools, due in part to these collaborative \nefforts. \n \nSUZANNE STROSSER: \nI  am  an  educator  at  Mission  High  School  in  Las  Vegas  which  is  the \nfirst publically funded recovery high school in the Nation. Mission High School \nprovides comprehensive education to students in recovery from substance use, \nabuse or dependency. We would use peer recovery support specialists to work \nthrough  responsible-thinking  processes,  productively  addressing  behaviors \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 9, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \ninterfering with those students’ education due to gaps in social and emotional \nlearning from early onset abuse. \n \nPeer support recovery specialists would address student concerns indicated in \ntheir weekly recovery check-ins and act as a mentors and models as students \nrecover.  These  relationships  are  beneficial  to  our  students  when  they  are \napprehensive  toward  obtaining  a  sponsor  during  their  recovery,  after  being \nadvised to avoid strangers. Baseline standards are necessary in providing this \nlow-barrier service with safe adults providing effective support to our students. \n \nERIN BEEN: \nI teach health at a high school in the Carson City School District, frequently \nusing local and State coalition provided tools needed to deliver evidence-based \nsubstance abuse prevention and mental health curriculum in my classes. I use \nthe  YRBSS  data  to  frame  evidence-based  curriculum  and  lessons  directly \nidentified by youth in the community.  \n \nCoalitions like Partnership Carson City are valuable to the community. I would \nlike  my  students  to  leave  my  class  with  content  knowledge,  skills  and \nresources. I have reached out to Partnership Carson City to plan lessons and \ncollaborate  in  developing  presentations  and  projects.  Together,  we  have \ndeveloped  youth  opportunities  after  school  in  the  community,  summer \nworkshops, evening programs and extended learning opportunities in relation to \nsubstance abuse prevention and mental health. I support S.B. 69. \n \nJOE JOANNE CULVER: \nI support S.B. 69 and will read from my written testimony (Exhibit L). \n \nJOHN  PIRO  (Chief  Deputy  Public  Defender,  Clark  County  Public  Defender’s \nOffice): \nI agree to removing section 8, subsection 2, “Any violation of this section is a \nmisdemeanor,” through the proposed amendment, Exhibit K.  \n \nSection 16, subsection 1, paragraph (d) does not raise the criminal penalty but \nadds the peer recovery support specialist into the growing list of those in an \nassault or battery constituting a gross misdemeanor rather than a misdemeanor. \nThis list has grown to the point where the exceptions are starting to swallow \nthe rules. We need peer support specialists to be protected from aggressive and \ndangerous  conduct,  however  do  not  believe  there  is  a  correlation  between \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 9, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nincreasing penalties and reduction in criminal behavior. The U.S. Department of \nJustice  has  studied  deterrents  in  this  manner  and  the  best  indicator  of \ndeterrents is a leniency of punishment, not an increase in penalty. \n \nIncreasing the penalty to a gross misdemeanor triggers a jury trial as opposed to \na  misdemeanor  bench  trial  which  increases  the  cost  of  prosecuting  and \ndefending  these  cases.  Most  affected  by  these  misdemeanor  trials  are  the \nmentally ill and drug-addicted. Removing section 16 language would allow us to \ngive our full support of S.B. 69. \n \nTREY DELAP (Director, Group Six Partners): \nI will read from my written testimony in opposition to S.B. 69 (Exhibit M). \n \nKENDRA BERTSCHY (Washoe County Public Defender’s Office): \nThe  Washoe  County  Public  Defender’s  Office  supports  the  peer  support \ncommunity,  hoping  they  are  able  to  help  the  citizens  of  our  community \novercome their addictions. For the reasons Mr. Piro stated, we are in opposition. \nWhen the enhancement was first established, there was testimony as to the \nconcern of the impact on those with mental health and substance abuse issues. \nThe  intent  is  to  ensure  we  help  those  involved  in  recovery;  however,  our \nconcern is the criminal enhancement.  \n \nSTEPHANIE WOODARD, PSY.D. (Senior Advisor on Behavioral Health, Division of \nPublic and Behavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services): \nBased  on  conversations  with  the  sponsor  on  the  bill  and  the  conceptual \namendment,  we  are  able  to  remove  the  fiscal  note  as  it  pertains  to  the \ndevelopment of regulation.  \n \nMARGOT  CHAPPEL  (Deputy  Administrator,  Division  of  Public  and  Behavioral \nHealth, Department of Health and Human Services): \nThe amendment removes the fiscal note from the Bureau of Healthcare Quality \nand Compliance as well. \n \nALLISON STEPHENS (Nevada PEP): \nI will read from my written testimony as neutral on S.B. 69 (Exhibit N), and \nhave provided a reference document on Family Peer Support (Exhibit O). \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 9, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nJOANNA JACOB (Clark County): \nClark County is neutral on Senate Bill 69. I am representing the Department of \nFamily Services today in a child welfare setting. The child welfare landscape is \nundergoing  a  fundamental  shift  toward  preventative  services  and \nevidence-based protocols, requiring implementation of some major policy at the \nfederal level. This model could be employed in the child welfare system for a \nparent in long-term successful and ongoing recovery, who may be able to help \nother  parents  struggling  with  substance  abuse  disorder  or  other  behavioral \nhealth disorders. We are in support of the overall goal and intent of the bill. We \nhave  asked  to  consider  a  technical  fix  and  offer  a  proposed  amendment \n(Exhibit P) to amend in the same requirements as agencies that employ those \nworking  with  children  or  families  to  undergo  a  background  check  with  the \nCentral  Registry  for  the  Collection  of  Information  Concerning  the  Abuse  or \nNeglect of a Child. This would include the screening for any substantiated report \nof abuse or neglect of a child. This is similar to other background checks in \nstatute.  \n \nDEBRA KAMKA (Director of Operations, Quest Counseling and Consulting): \nQuest Counseling and Consulting stands neutral on S.B. 69. We have had a \n16-year  relationship  with  our  community  coalition,  Join  Together  Northern \nNevada  (JTNN),  which  is  a  collaborative  organization.  Along  with  law \nenforcement,  JTNN  created  the  first  prescription  drug  roundup  to  address \nprescription  drug  abuse,  facilitate  monthly  committees  on  a  variety  of \ndrug-related topics and work with all interested parties to provide solutions to \ncommunity substance use problems. Quest Counseling and Consulting values \nthe YRBSS trend reports published by JTNN and its biennial prevention plan. It \nprovides informational rack cards or prescription drug lockboxes for our clients. \nCoalitions provide great value and local knowledge in their communities and can \naddress community problems at the local level quickly and in a cost-efficient \nmanner.  \n \nGWEN TAYLOR (Executive Director, Access For Community & Cultural Education \nPrograms & Trainings): \nWe are neutral on S.B. 69. I have worked with the local coalition, JTNN, since \n2002. Our community has substance abuse prevention coalitions that respond \nto community needs such as underage drinking, marijuana and prescription drug \nuse. Through JTNN, we have obtained subgranted general funds and federal \ngrant  dollars  to  reach  youth  through  evidence-based  programing  in  schools, \nafter-school programs, juvenile probation and in churches. We impact youth and \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 9, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nprovide  jobs  to  the  community  through  subgranted  funds.  Join  Together \nNorthern Nevada is able to bring the community together to address important \ndrug issues whether facilitating a committee, bringing in a national speaker or \norganizing a community event. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 69 and open the hearing on S.B. 70. \n \nSENATE BILL 70: Revises provisions governing mental health. (BDR 39-418) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN ROBIN L. TITUS (Assembly District No. 38): \nSenate  Bill 70  addresses  several  complex,  important  behavioral  healthcare \nissues in Nevada. This bill results from significant stakeholder engagements, \nmeetings, time and effort on the part of the Northern Regional Behavioral Health \nPolicy Board and its Coordinator, Jessica Flood. We met weekly for the better \npart of a year to develop this piece of legislation and proposed amendment \n(Exhibit Q).  \n \nIn  2017,  the  Legislature  passed  A.B. No. 366  of  the  79th  Session  which \ncreated the Northern, Washoe, Rural and Southern Behavioral Health Regions. \nThe bill established a behavioral health policy board for each region. The boards \nare  responsible  for  improvement  and  delivery  of  behavioral  health  services \nthroughout the State. They are required to advise relevant Executive Branch \nagencies  on  regional  behavioral  health  issues,  identify  gaps  in  services  and \ncoordinate with each other to provide recommendations to the Department of \nHealth and Human Services. Each board is authorized to request one bill draft \nrequest with regional, systemic State issues. \n \nIn  2019,  A.B. No. 76  of  the  80th  Session  was  sponsored  by  the  Southern \nRegional Behavioral Health Policy Board which revised the geographic locations \ncreating a fifth board and establishing the Clark Behavioral Health Region which \nnow consists of Clark County and a portion of Nye County.  \n \nThe 2021 Legislative Session is the second session in which the behavioral \nhealth policy boards have submitted a BDR. In 2019, the Northern Regional \nBehavioral Health Policy Board sponsored A.B. No. 85 of the 80th Session to \naddress  additional  gaps  and  challenges  existing  in  the  behavioral  healthcare \nsystem to better serve vulnerable Nevadans. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 9, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nTAYLOR ALLISON (Chair, Northern Regional Behavioral Health Policy Board): \nI will review the presentation for S.B. 70, Modernizing and Clarifying the Mental \nHealth Crisis Hold Process, from the Northern Regional Behavioral Health Policy \nBoard (Exhibit R), covering slides 1 through 3. \n \nWe are focused on modernizing, standardizing and reducing stigma in Nevada’s \nmental health crisis hold process found in Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 433A. \nWe are continuing the work initiated by our previous bill, A.B. No. 85 of the \n80th  Session,  which  passed  with  bipartisan  support  in  between \nLegislative Sessions.  \n \nAssembly Bill No. 85 of the 80th Session was brought forth by the Northern \nBoard after the need for policy change was identified in 2018. Individuals in \ncrisis in hospital emergency rooms have waited up to ten days for inpatient beds \nin psychiatric facilities. There have been various interpretations from courts and \nproviders on when the 72-hour clock begins, and NRS 433A utilized language to \ncreate additional stigma of individuals experiencing a mental health crisis. \n \nJessica Flood established a multiuse disciplinary, statewide mental health crisis \nhold working group to take a deep dive into the language and address those \ncritical  issues.  During  the  process  of  developing  A.B. No. 85  of  the \n80th Session, stakeholders gained a greater understanding of the issues and \ngaps in the law and saw the need for continued legislative efforts to update \nNRS 433A to better reflect the mental health crisis hold system we have today.  \n \nSince A.B. No. 85 of the 80th Session passed, the statewide mental health \ncrisis workgroup has continued to meet, working collaboratively with State staff \nand the Division of Public and Behavioral Health. They worked on regulations \nmandating hospital reporting of mental health crisis holds, clarifying medical \nclearance,  behavioral  health  transportation  and  the  process  for  involuntary \nadministration of medication. \n \nThe  Navigating  Your  Way  Through  a  Mental  Health  Crisis  Hold  in  Nevada \nbooklet emailed to the Senate Health and Human Services Committee reviews \nthe hold process, current law and patient rights. If S.B. 70 passes, the working \ngroup will continue to update the packet to reflect modern practice. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 9, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nJESSICA FLOOD (Coordinator, Northern Regional Behavioral Health Policy Board): \nI will provide an overview of mental health crisis holds in the remaining slides of \nour presentation, Exhibit R,  slide 5, labeled Mental Health Crisis Hold while \nreading from my written presentation (Exhibit S). \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nAre there concerns that when a peace officer comes to effectuate an order, the \nofficer may end up arresting the individual? Are there safeguards to ensure the \nindividual will enter into the mental health system, or will peace officers still be \nable to make an arrest? \n \nMS. FLOOD: \nThis is not an issue contemplated in the law. \n \nKATIE RYAN (Dignity Health - St. Rose Dominican): \nI  have  provided  a  letter  of  support  (Exhibit  T)  on  behalf  of  Dignity \nHealth - St. Rose Dominican.  \n \nMS. BERTSCHY: \nThe  Washoe  County  Public  Defender’s  Office  represented  2,185  individuals \nduring 2020 in involuntary commitment hearings. Unfortunately, the example \ngiven earlier by Ms. Flood, happens more than we would like. There are times \nwhen individuals involved in mental health crisis end up being arrested rather \nthan taken to a mental health treatment facility. This is something we hope to \nwork on in the future. It is the goal of the stakeholders to decrease interactions \nof law enforcement with someone experiencing a mental health crisis.  \n \nIn  section  11,  regarding  the  definition  of  when  someone  is  involved  in \ninvoluntary commitment, the intent is not to expand but to capture more people. \nThis  will  be  followed  closely  as  the  bill  nears  enactment  to  ensure  we  are \nfocusing on the individuals of need. We support S.B. 70. \n \nJIM HOFFMAN (Nevada Attorneys for Criminal Justice): \nI echo the comments by Ms. Bertschy and am in support of S.B. 70 and the \namendment. \n \nJOAN HALL (President, Nevada Rural Hospital Partners): \nNevada Rural Hospital Partners supports S.B. 70.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 9, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nJOANNE  MALAY  (Deputy  Administrator,  Clinical  Services  and  Mental  Health, \nDivision  of  Public  and  Behavioral  Health,  Department  of  Health  and \nHuman Services): \nThe Division of Public and Behavioral Health is neutral on this bill. We submitted \na fiscal note based on introductory language. Previous language in section 11 \nwas  permissible  as  Northern  Nevada  Adult  Mental  Health  Services  and  the \nSubstance  Abuse  and  Mental  Health  Services  Administration  are  the  only \ncurrent assisted outpatient treatment (AOT) programs.

(BDR 40-329) \n \nHAROLD WICKHAM (Deputy Director, Department of Corrections): \nExisting  law  prohibits  the  charging  of  fees  for  the  issuance  of  copies  of \ncertificates and records of birth to homeless persons and persons released from \nprison within the immediately preceding 90 days. This bill prohibits the charging \nof fees to persons who are imprisoned. \n \nNICK SHEPACK (American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada): \nWe support A.B. 16. It should be the policy of the State to ensure incarcerated \npersons have the tools needed to succeed upon release. Over 90 percent of \nthose incarcerated in the State will get out of prison. To be released without \nnecessary documents such as birth certificates can lead to an untold number of \nissues. When people are released from prison, they are forced to find housing, \nfood and employment. A birth certificate is often needed to obtain these things. \nAssembly Bill 16 is a simple and impactful piece of legislation that will reduce \nrecidivism and increase success rates for Nevada's formerly incarcerated. \n \nWILLIAM PREGMAN (Battle Born Progress): \nWe support A.B. 16. We ditto the previous speaker's remarks. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 13, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nKENDRA BERTSCHY (Deputy Public Defender, Washoe County Public Defender's \nOffice): \nWe support A.B. 16. We echo the comments from the previous speakers. This \nbill  is  an  easy  way  to  provide  our  community  members  with  a  chance  to \nsucceed in the future. \n \nJIM HOFFMAN (Nevada Attorneys for Criminal Justice): \nWe  support  A.B.  16.  We  ditto  the  previous  speakers.  Access  to  birth \ncertificates  is  a  small  investment  but  can  have  a  huge  impact  for  both \nincarcerated people and the community at large. \n \nJODI HOCKING (Founder, Return Strong): \nWe  support  A.B.  16.  My  husband  was  incarcerated  at  the  Department  of \nCorrections (DOC). He was impacted by this exact issue. He, among others, \nwas released after winning a lawsuit on A.B. No. 510 of the 74th Session. \nAfter being institutionalized and having post-traumatic stress disorder, it led him \nto get into a fight. This resulted in a violation and return to prison. He came \nhome from prison with no identification or birth certificate and could not be \nfound in vital statistics. We still do not know why, as he went to school in \nNevada,  was  in  prison  in  Nevada  and  yet  was  nonexistent.  We  have  been \nasking DOC for two years to help us find his birth certificate. The reality of not \nhaving a birth certificate made it impossible for him to get health insurance or \nemployment. This issue could have been resolved before he came home. People \nneed to prove their identity as soon as they walk out of prison. It is necessary \nto find jobs and integrate into society. You cannot do that if you cannot prove \nwho you are. \n \nJOHN PIRO (Deputy Public Defender, Clark County Public Defender's Office): \nWe support A.B. 16. We can verify people's identity enough to lock them away \nfor years, yet we do not provide them with a document when they get out of \nprison to identify themselves and rehabilitate their lives. This is a great measure. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will entertain a motion on A.B. 16.  \n \nSENATOR HARRIS MOVED TO DO PASS A.B. 16. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 13, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will open the hearing on Senate Concurrent Resolution (S.C.R.) 5. \n \nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 5: Urges certain actions to address the \npublic health crisis in Nevada. (BDR R-966) \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \n\"Prejudice is a burden that confuses the past, threatens the future and renders \nthe present inaccessible.\" These are the words of Maya Angelou. Prejudice has \ncontributed  to  the  creation  of  systemic  racism  and  structures  of  racial \ndiscrimination  that  result  in  generational  poverty  and  perpetuate  debilitating \neconomic,  educational  and  health  challenges.  This  disproportionately  affects \npeople of color. Senate Concurrent Resolution 5 takes a step toward addressing \nthis  systemic  racism  and  structures  of  racial  discrimination  and  their \ndisproportionate  impact  on  people  of  color  in  the  Covid-19  era.  For  these \nreasons and others, S.C.R. No. 1 of the 32nd Special Session was adopted \ndeclaring systemic racism and structures of racial discrimination constitute a \npublic health crisis. \n \nLast week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Center stated racism \nis a public health crisis. We have talked about it a long time, but it is now time \nto act on solutions designed to deconstruct this poison in our society. Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 5 declares all Nevada residents have equal consideration \nand opportunity under the law, policies and practices of the State. \n \nNevada  supports  local,  State,  regional  and  federal  initiatives  to  understand, \naddress and dismantle systemic racism. Federal funding should be distributed \nequitably based on the portion of members of Black, Indigenous and People of \nColor  (BIPOC)  communities.  This  would  address  issues  disproportionately \naffecting  those  communities  in  direct  proportion  to  their  disadvantage  by \nindividual racial category. I have asked professionals to join me today who have \nworked on various community projects including: Shawn Rochester, who has \nexperience working in corporate America and has authored The Black Tax: The \nCost of Being Black in America; Dr. Kara Freeman, professional dietician; Alisa \nHoward who has worked with community health care for the last nine years; \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 13, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nTina  Dortch  from  the  Office  of  Minority  Health  and  Equity;  Pastor  Karen \nAnderson of the First African Methodist Episcopal Church in Las Vegas; and \nYindra  Dixon,  a  community  and  organizing  activist  in  our  community  and \nprincipal of Blackbox Consulting. \n \nSHAWN ROCHESTER: \nWhen people talk about discrimination, they tend to focus on the injustice or the \nimmorality  associated  with  discrimination.  I  look  at  the  economic  cost  of \ndiscrimination and what the research from the finest institutions in the Country \nsay about that cost. The research examines the cost in the modern-day context. \nIt lays out where we are as a Nation with Black people owning about 2 percent \nof U.S. wealth and lays out an economic case for how we can create millions of \njobs  and  businesses  and  provide  missing  capital  in  Black  communities.  It \npromotes  ways  leading  to  better  health  and  educational  outcomes.  Wealth \naffects  educational  and  health  outcomes,  trauma  and  other  issues  it \nexacerbates. \n \nThe cost of discrimination emanates from conscious and unconscious bias from \ninstitutions,  individuals,  organizations  and  corporations.  One  of  the  first \nquestions to ask is what levels of bias and anti-Black bias exist in the Country \ntoday.  Work  has  been  done  at  major  universities  that  examined  levels  of \nanti-Black bias across the American electorate. Research found 51 percent of \nAmericans  have  automatic  White  preference;  this  is  another  way  of  saying \nanti-Black bias. \n \nI want to discuss housing issues. As a Black person, you will be told about and \nshown 20 percent fewer homes. When you apply for a mortgage, your credit \nrating  will  be  up  to  71  points  lower.  When  you  apply  for  the  loan,  it  is \n60 percent more likely to be denied with the same credit profile as a White peer. \nThe Black person is likely to receive higher closing costs, and the appreciation in \nhome  equity  is  substantially  lower.  When  selling  your  home,  there  is  an \nappraisal gap typically much lower on your home. These are massive, significant \nmaterial economic costs. \n \nDiscrimination  or  racial  bias  also  shows  up  in  the  labor  market.  Research \nindicates that resumes with a White-sounding name receive 50 percent more \ncallbacks versus the same resume with a Black-sounding name. A White felon \nwith that resume has a higher callback ratio than a Black college graduate. This \nhas a significant impact on high-end careers. When it comes to capital-raising \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 13, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nfor business, Black owners pay 100 basis points higher for their business loans. \nA Black business owner with superior credit pays higher interest rates than his \nor her White peer. Bias shows up both in conscious and unconscious ways and \nhas an economic and discriminatory impact. \n \nLooking  at  resources  distributed  through  the  G.I.  Bill  since  1944,  less  than \n2 percent  went  to  Black  people.  The  1862  Homestead  Act,  funds  given  to \nAmericans to start a great life, went to 99.7 percent White Americans. Between \n1930 and 1960, less than 1 percent of mortgages in the Country went to Black \nAmericans  because  of  the  Federal  Housing  Administration  redlining  practice. \nGoods and services during the same time period were three times higher for \nBlack communities. The impact from a historical perspective and what is still \nhappening now has led to Black Americans owning about 2 percent of the U.S. \nwealth. Anti-Black bias is far higher than we all want or realize. The impact, \nboth present and past, has been draconian. This has also had a massive impact \non the Country. \n \nKARA FREEMAN, DRPH (Nevada Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics): \nI am speaking as the State Policy Representative and President-Elect for the \nNevada  Academy  of  Nutrition  and  Dietetics.  I  am  a  registered \ndietitian/nutritionist and will be addressing the health disparities found in the \nAfrican-American  population.  My  written  presentation  has  been  submitted \n(Exhibit B). \n \nALISA HOWARD (Owner, Minority Health Consultants): \nI am the owner of Minority Health Consultants, a woman-owned public health \nconsulting  firm,  and  I  am  also  a  college  instructor  who  teaches  community \nhealth work. My written presentation has been submitted (Exhibit C). \n \nTINA  DORTCH  (Program  Manager,  Office  of  Minority  Health  and  Equity, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nI will address how the concept of proportional allocation framed within S.C.R. 5 \nreflects in S.B. 302 and S.B. 341. I have submitted my written presentation \ndiscussing these issues (Exhibit D). \n \nSENATE BILL 302: Revises provisions relating to governmental administration. \n(BDR 18-171) \n \nSENATE BILL 341: Revises provisions relating to health care. (BDR 40-62) \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 13, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nKAREN ANDERSON (Senior Pastor, First African Methodist Episcopal Church): \nWe have listened to how poverty and racism have had a disparate effect on \ncommunities of color. The issue of structural racism has been shown to be \nexacerbated during Covid-19. It has been imperative to work toward equity in \nour society. Our focus has always been on meeting the spiritual, emotional and \nphysical needs of all people. \n \nFaith has played a critical and central role in the life of the BIPOC community. \nWe are often the place where people come when they have a need not being \naddressed by our government. We are the stopgap. Pastors are the ones who \nare often the first point of contact in a community and make up the difference \nwhen there is a financial need. We are there for emotional and physical needs. \nWe are there when there is a housing need. We have seen what has happened \nwith Covid-19 and the disparate distribution of wealth. \n \nPeople are always calling for peace, and we think of peace as the absence of \nconflict. Peace in the Hebrew bible means the absence of justice. We will never \nhave peace in our Nation until we have justice. Justice should not be based on \nrace, class, ethnicity, gender-loving preference or religious affiliation. We are all \ncreated equal in the eyes of God. We must be those who seek to ensure every \nmember of our community has access to what one needs. \n \nI have met with members who have struggled because of unemployment, lack \nof child care, food security and the inability to access needed services. We have \ncounseled families who are struggling with emotional trauma from the loss of \nloved ones for whom they could not afford the burial costs. Students are being \nadversely affected, and their grades have dropped during the pandemic. It is \nimperative for us to build a community where the life of every human being has \nvalue, respect and dignity. We must ensure equitable distribution of wealth and \nopportunities for us to move forward. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nWe want to lay the foundation and show how the distribution of monies for \nhealth care affects our communities all the way around. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThere is historical inequity in our society and institutions that had an exponential \nimpact  as  time  passed.  We  have  made  progress,  but  in  other  ways,  the \nCovid-19  pandemic  has  shown  a  light  on  many  ways  we  have  not  made \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 13, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nprogress.  You  are  making  a  policy  recommendation  for  moving  forward  on \nproportionate allocation of resources, and that is one policy strategy. Are there \nother policy recommendations you would want the Legislature to be aware of \nthat  can  specifically  address  the  wealth  and  equities  leading  to  health \ninequities? \n \nMR. ROCHESTER: \nI  want  to  talk  about  frameworks  by  which  we  could  measure  the  efficacy \nimpact of policies and plans that may ultimately be put in place. There are \nmassive gaps when it comes to jobs, businesses and wealth. Policies and plans \nneed to have a direct stimulative impact within the Black community on the \nfollowing: job creation, business formation and expansion, capital availability, \nand  affordability.  The  driving  communities,  enclaves  and  ecosystems  we  all \nwant  cannot  be  built  in  an  infrastructure  with  a  gap  in  jobs,  business  and \ncapital.  \n \nWe  need  to  have  an  ecosystem  approach  and  look  at  creating  effective \ncommunities dealing with economic deprivation. As companies are formed and \nreal estate developed, they are not utilizing the local products and services of \nthe businesses within the community. You can have a coordinated effort among \nvery  different  parties  sharing  a  similar  intention.  It  needs  to  be  directly \nstimulative  to  jobs,  businesses  and  capital  within  the  Black  community  in \nparticular. The healthcare infrastructure is critical. We have the worst health, \naccess to health care and treatment. \n \nYINDRA DIXON (Managing Partner, Blackbox Consulting Group LLC): \nI  have  submitted  written  testimony  to  address  the  concept  of  proportional \nallocation framed within S.C.R. 5 (Exhibit E). \n \nDENNIS CREARY (President, CEO, Blacks on Wall Street, Inc.): \nThere has to be something various communities could and should do to address \ndisparities and systemic pressures our communities have been under globally for \n400 years and beyond. In 1948, a bill and act passed in the United Kingdom \n(U.K.), where I am from, stated regardless of people's stations in life, their most \nprecious gift was their health. The National Health System was started as a \nresult. A system such as the one in the U.K. does not exist in the U.S. An \nindividual who is poor or destitute can become even much more so if ill. You \ncan be the wealthiest individual in the U.S. or the poorest individual, but if you \ndo not have your health, you cannot function in your particular station in life. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 13, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nIn  1919,  at  the  onset  of  the  Spanish  flu,  frontline  workers  were \ndisproportionately  affected  and  unrecorded,  as  men  were  Black  and  Brown \nindividuals. Fast forwarding 100 years later to this particular pandemic, we have \nnot learned anything from history. Frontline workers are still Black and Brown \nand disproportionately affected. To address your question, if there are other \nmeasures made to address disproportionate wealth, which has been systemic in \nBlack  and  Brown  communities,  health  is  first  and  foremost.  If  you  are \ndisproportionately affected, you should be compensated accordingly. I want to \nlend my support to Senator Spearman.  \n \nDr. Randall W. Maxey, world-renowned nephrologist, has been running a weekly \nglobal program talking about Covid's effects in Black communities around the \nworld. He had planned to be here but was called into surgery just before this \nmeeting. Dr. Maxey is supportive of this measure. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nPastor  Anderson  wants  to  ensure  there  are  more  credentialed  minority \nproviders, especially when dealing with mental and emotional health. We have \nnot done well with this issue.  \n \nPASTOR ANDERSON: \nOne of the important keys is to understand partnering with the faith community \ncan help as we begin to move into neighborhoods. We have access to those in \nthe community. We are the first to hear what they are going through. We do \nknow there is a need for mental and emotional health services. It is important to \ntap into and access the faith community that has a desire to see our community \nmove forward. Another way to help are policies. In St. Louis, Missouri, one of \nthe programs they instituted was in communities of color, particularly in the \neducational  system.  As  children  come  into  kindergarten,  they  start  a  bank \naccount with $50. We have not been taught how to manage money. Policy can \nbe  investing  in  our  children,  not  just  in  their  education  but  also  financially \nhelping them move out of the poverty in which they exist. There are programs \npartnering  with  banks  to  teach  financial  literacy  to  children  as  young  as \nkindergarten age. Sometimes, we wait until high school; by that time, many of \nour children have been lost. \n \nThe faith community can be a strong help. We are seeing a rise in mental health \nand depression. I do not have all the information for what is available, but we \nknow we need more mental health services in school. As these children go back \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 13, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nto school, more counseling services will be needed. Teachers who have been \nstudying distance-learning teaching, spinning on a dime to create educational \nprograms to keep kids interested, also need counseling. There is a lot of work to \nbe done. We need to invest in our education to make sure we have available \nresources. We also need to partner with church communities. We offer space to \nbuild a counseling center directly in the neighborhood. Transit is also an issue \nfor many people living in our community as many are unable to travel across \ntown for services they need. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSenator Dina Neal developed a wonderful program called Nevada Grow that \nspeaks to some of the things Mr. Rochester spoke about including investing in \ncommunities and building an ecosystem. The good news is we have a program \nthat puts $50 into kindergarteners' accounts. The bad news is I do not know if \npeople understand it or if we are not connecting with people about the program. \nRather than build 50 new programs, we need to conduct an inventory of the \nprograms  we  already  have  on  the  books.  We  need  to  make  sure  we  are \nconnecting those programs to communities of color and using spokespeople to \nconnect communities to existing programs. \n \nI have a northern Nevada friend who put a lot of work into creating financial \ncoaching programs taking place at a church after the sermon. People worked on \nfinancial literacy and learned tools to build assets and wealth. It was a powerful \nprogram. There are wonderful things happening, and it is about how we connect \nthe dots to inform people about these types of programs. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI am thrilled to hear where this is going and where some people have been. I \nrecognize in this pandemic we have had challenges with getting vaccines. It is \ncritical we enlist the faith-based organizations to ensure we get people their \nvaccines, especially those who are at risk, frontliners or have diseases. The \njuxtaposition of vaccines and the people who know and live in the community is \ncritical. The vaccine illustrates we have not really taken advantage of the people \nin the neighborhood. \n \nKATIE ROE RYAN (Dignity Health–St. Rose Dominican): \nWe support S.C.R.  5. Health  inequities  and systemic racism have caused a \npublic health crisis. Dignity Health-St. Rose Dominican is addressing systematic \ninequities  experienced  by  BIPOC  and  other  underserved  communities  and \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 13, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nreversing  the  effects  of  systematic  racism  which  require  a  long-term \ncommitment. Our first steps include expanding access to care in underserved \ncommunities, improving how we track outcomes by race, expanding implicit and \nunconscious bias training, growing programs which impact social causes of poor \nhealth  and  further  diversifying  our  leadership.  One  example  is  our  ten-year \npartnership with Morehouse School of Medicine to develop and train more Black \nphysicians. \n \nDignity  Health-St.  Rose  Dominican  also  pays  close  attention  to  the  social \ndeterminants of health as the social causes of poor health need to be dealt with \nthe same velocity as acute medical conditions. Some of these issues include \nhousing, food security, violence prevention and access to culturally competent \ncare. We vow to be a partner in the fight to make sure health care is equitable \nfor all. \n \nANDRE WADE (Silver State Equality): \nWe support S.C.R. 5. Silver State Equality takes an intersexual approach to the \nwork we do and our concern about the compounding impact of racism as a \npublic health issue. We urge you to pass this resolution to improve the health \nand well-being of Nevadans. Black, Indigenous and People of Color tend to be at \nthe bottom of positive health outcome measures and when you consider LGBTQ \nidentities, it is doubly so. \n \nALYSSA LACAP: \nI support S.C.R. 5. I am a student at University of Nevada, Las Vegas, a person \nof color and an intern for the American Heart Association. This is the kind of \nwork and policy we would like to see more often. Racism has a huge effect on \npublic health. I have seen many friends, who are people of color, struggle this \npast year due to Covid-19. I have seen many lives lost. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nWe need help with mental and emotional health. Pastor Anderson, can you \nspeak  to  some  of  the  things  you  walked  into  in  Ferguson,  Missouri,  after \nMichael Brown's murder? \n \nPASTOR ANDERSON: \nYou are correct. We need a lot of mental and emotional help. Many people who \nlive  in  BIPOC  communities  live  in  what  we  consider  to  be  toxic  stress \nenvironments,  whether  it  is  due  to  a  lack  of  food,  safety  or  health-related \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 13, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nissues. Waking up as a person of color and not knowing when you will see on \nthe news as the next person whose life has been taken evokes memories of not \njust that one loss but every loss you have experienced. For many, it takes them \nall the way back to before the death of Treyvon Martin in Florida. \n \nIn  Ferguson,  faith-communities  worked  along  with  minority  mental-health \nprofessionals to bring mental health into the communities. We set up tents and \nhad mental-health professionals there. This allowed people to stop by and talk \nabout  what  they  were  going  through.  We  also  provided  opportunities  for \nluncheons where we paid for parents who had lost children to violence and \ncould come together. We brought professionals from counseling and spiritual \ncare in to speak with them. Together, they would have a community to build \nrelationships. We sent counselors into the school systems. It was intense work \nand done closely with the faith community. The faith community can help get \ninformation out. I was not aware of some programs mentioned earlier and am \nsure our constituents are not aware. It is a wonderful opportunity to partner. \n \nSome of those children in Ferguson, particularly because of what happened with \nthe militarized policing, have been traumatized to the point where they cannot \ntolerate loud sounds anymore due to the tear gas and flash bangs they heard. \nWe do not know what causes trauma in young people and children. We do \nknow it is often expressed in ways we do not understand. Sometimes, those \nchildren we think are hyperactive are really suffering from depression. Children \nwho act out in classrooms are often suffering from depression. It is imperative \nwe  have  health  professionals  who  understand  the  difference  between \ndepression in adults versus children. We also worked hard in St. Louis, Missouri, \nto move resource officers out of schools and move in more counselors who \ncould work with students and teach them de-escalation techniques. To move \nfrom retributive to restorative justice practices is essential as we look at things \nwe can do. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI will never know what it feels like as a mother to send my son off to school or \nwork without worrying. I will not know what it feels like when my brothers and \nnephews  are  not  home,  whether  they  are  here  or  some  other  part  of  the \nCountry. I would like to know that. The mental and emotional stress has a direct \neffect on the physical body. If you have not been familiarized with some of the \ntrauma and the day-to-day stress of being Black, Latin, Indigenous or anyone \nwho is a person of color in America, please listen to our hearts. It is hurting. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 13, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nAlthough  this  is  a  resolution,  I  want  this  to  serve  as  a  blueprint  to  move \nforward, especially when it comes to caring for those who have lost loved ones \nduring Covid-19. \n \nA few weeks ago my brother died very suddenly, and those of us who did not \nlive in Indiana were not able to go. I remember that day watching his service \nonline. Covid-19 has taught us a different way of living and a different way of \ndying. That, on top of what we have already experienced in disparities with \nhealth care, has been compounded. We may not know the total wreckage of \nwhat has taken place in our communities, but I am asking everyone to please \nhear our hearts and help us, please. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nA step we can take today is to support S.C.R. 5, and I am prepared to do a \nwork session on this resolution. I first want to acknowledge a resolution is \nimportant and meaningful work. It is a statement we need to make. I want to \nthank  Ms. Dortch  for  connecting  the  work  of  S.C.R.  5  into  S.B.  302  into \nS.B. 341 and acknowledge we are attempting to do this work in an imperfect \nsystem and world. We have the reality of trying to pass good policy and making \na  difference  during  a  Session  generally  not  offering  the  kind  of  time  we \ngenerated  today.  The  next  step  is  the  hard  work  of  making  sure  we  pass \nS.C.R. 5 out of this Committee. Both S.B. 302 and S.B. 341 will go the Senate \nCommittee on Finance. The pace in the Committee on Finance is significantly \ndifferent than the pace in this Committee. Our Committee today can stand by \nthe statement and pass it out of Committee. We can say we have identified the \nright problem and, globally, what is in this resolution, is correct. To make a \ndifference, we need to work together to make sure the technical process of \ngetting bill language to accomplish what we need to do is the next step. I will \nentertain a motion of S.C.R. 5. \n \nSENATOR HARDY MOVED TO ADOPT S.C.R. 5. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 13, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will now open the hearing on A.B. 35. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 35: Revises provisions governing certain programs to assist \nsenior citizens and persons with disabilities with costs relating to health \ncare. (BDR 40-288) \n \nDENA SCHMIDT (Administrator, Aging and Disability Services Division, Department \nof Health and Human Services): \nThe intent of A.B. 35 is to consolidate the senior and disability prescription drug \nprograms to remove the lengthy income and eligibility requirements as well as to \nalign the definitions of \"senior\" and \"persons with disability\" in NRS 427A. I \nhave submitted a written presentation (Exhibit F). Our Social Services Chief, \nJeff Duncan, will walk you through the specific highlights throughout the bill. \n \nJEFFREY DUNCAN (Social Services Chief, Aging and Disability Services Division, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nI  have  submitted  a  written  presentation  with  all  of  the  specific  highlights \nthroughout A.B. 35, Exhibit F. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIs there a cap on the age for the income as we merge the two programs? \n \nMS. SCHMIDT: \nWe will still have an age cap. We are aligning the age cap with all of our other \nprograms in our definition of senior citizens. The income cap will come out of \nstatute, and we will use the regulatory process to adopt a new income standard \nbased on community input and community need. The Medicare Part D program \nhas completely changed the intent of this program. This program was developed \nin statute before Medicare Part D existed. A lot of our Medicare recipients have \ncompletely different needs now. We want the ability to build a program which \nwraps around current Medicare benefits and provides a better benefit than we \nare able to do with these limitations. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWill that help people with their donut hole, which is a temporary limit on what \nthe Medicare prescription drug plan will pay for prescription drug costs? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 13, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nMS. SCHMIDT: \nYes.  The  donut  hole  has  been  removed  so  their  copayments  are  the  same \nthroughout the process. Oftentimes, one of the barriers is the copayment. Our \nprogram does not cover the copayment. We would like to have the ability to \nadopt regulations to wrap around the Medicare plans existing today. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIn one place, section 13 says \"62 years of age,\" and another place in the bill \nsays \"60 years of age.\" Is the bill still going to be 62 years of age? \n \nMR. DUNCAN: \nSection 13 makes a conforming change to ensure the amendments made by \nsection 6 in the bill do not inadvertently affect certain other programs calling out \n62  years  of  age  or  older  specific  to  NRS 439.650.  Section  6  of  this  bill \nredefines the term \"senior citizen\" to mean a person who is 60 years of age or \nolder for the purposes of the consolidated program. \n \nCHARLIE SHEPARD (AARP): \nWe support A.B. 35. Nevada's older adults and persons with disabilities want to \nremain living at home. The Fund for a Healthy Nevada provides a variety of \nservices  helping  seniors  and  persons  with  disabilities  maintain  their \nindependence and health. This bill removes current restrictions and allows the \nprograms to meet the needs in the community. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nIs there a strategy for partnering with faith-based organizations to advise people \nabout the programs so they can participate? \n \nMS. SCHMIDT: \nHistorically, this program has been limited in funding, and we have not done a \nlot of outreach which has been challenging. We have been working hard to \nfigure out ways to partner and coordinate across all our programs as we do \noutreach. Adopting new regulations is done through a regulatory process, which \nis a public process. We will absolutely make sure we reach out to faith-based \norganizations to ensure participation in the process and ensure people are aware \nof these meeting. \n \nSeniors and people with disabilities still have prescription drug needs and high \ncosts related to those prescriptions. Our goal is to adopt regulations to meet \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 13, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nthose new needs which are different than what they used to be. It used to be \nMedicare had astronomical costs for their prescriptions, then Part D came, then \nthe copays, then the donut hole. Yes, it has changed over time. We intend to do \na lot of community outreach and partner with Ms. Dortch from the Office of \nMinority  Health  and  Equity  to  make  sure  we  hear  from  everyone  in  all \ncommunities and build a program to meet those needs.  \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI have the contact information for Pastor Anderson to do a direct outreach to \nfaith-based communities if you would like to have it. \n \nMS. SCHMIDT: \nAbsolutely. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRemainder of page intentionally left blank; signature page to follow. \n   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 13, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe will close the hearing on A.B. 35.

(BDR R-189) \n \nSENATOR JOSEPH P. HARDY (Senatorial District No. 12): \nThis is a bill urging business owners to provide personal protective equipment \n(PPE) to their workers. If we can do something that prevents the spread of the \ncoronavirus, also called SARS-CoV-2, which causes the Covid-19 disease, we \nwill protect our businesses, families, and people who come into our businesses. \nThere are many different ways we can enjoy protection, not just through the \nvaccines, that we can do now. \n \nThe bill provides businesses the opportunity to protect everyone, and for us, as \na Legislature, by sending a copy of this resolution to the Labor Commissioner. \nAt the Legislative Counsel Bureau, we have made an investment to ensure our \nemployees and others are protected. Wearing a mask is an act of appreciation \nand love for other people. This resolution is urging business owners to protect \ntheir people and others and protect the economy of their own businesses by \nusing masks, face shields, hand sanitizers and sanitized wipes. If we have a \nculture of protection, we will find it will pay benefits. \n \nSHANNON CHAMBERS (Labor Commissioner, Department of Business and Industry): \nI fully support this resolution, and at the Office of the Labor Commissioner, we \nissue  mandatory  bulletins  and  guidance  to  employers  who  look  to  us  for \nguidance on all types of issues including Covid-19. I think this is a wonderful \nidea, and to the extent it passes, I will make every effort to educate employers \nand make sure it is posted. The public health situation is an issue we all need to \naddress, and it certainly impacts labor. Over the past 12 months, this has been \na huge function of our Office. I support this resolution and will make every \neffort to do what is required once the resolution is passed. \n \nVICTORIA CARREON (Administrator, Division of Industrial Relations, Department of \nBusiness and Industry): \nOur agency includes Nevada  OSHA which has  been at the forefront of the \nCovid-19  enforcement  effort.  The  Safety,  Consultation  and  Training  Section \nprovides free safety, training and technical assistance to employers. Providing \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nPPE is a requirement under the Code of Federal Regulations. Face coverings are \nnot technically considered PPE; however, Nevada OSHA is requiring employers \nto provide face coverings to employees as part of its guidelines to complement \nthe Governor's directives. \n \nOur  Safety,  Consultation  and  Training  Section  conducts  monthly  classes  on \nPPE, has an outreach list of 2,500 people interested in safety issues for both \nemployers and employees, and uses an email list from the SilverFlume Nevada's \nBusiness  Portal  database  with  over  32,000  people.  We  would  be  happy  to \ncomply with S.C.R. 1 and would like to ensure that Nevada employees receive \nall the PPE they should have to protect themselves and others. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe Safety, Consultation and Training Section has three offices, in Reno, Elko \nand Las Vegas, which are reaching out to do what they can. It is admirable that \nwe have made this decision to protect each other and our businesses and return \nourselves to an economy as vibrant as it was before. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSenator Hardy, are you open to cosponsors? \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI  would  be  thrilled  and  complimented  if  anyone  wants  to  sign  on  to  this \nresolution.  I  do  not  think  we  can  do  enough.  If  we  want  to  make  a  good \ndecision and be a good example to people, I would invite anyone and everyone \nto sign on to this. Something that urges by example is a good idea. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI will sign on. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI would also like to sign on as a cosponsor. Would anyone else? Since everyone \nhas indicated agreement, we will send this resolution forward, first sponsored \nby  Senator  Hardy  and  the  entire  Senate  Committee  on  Health  and  Human \nServices. \n \nHearing no public testimony, I will close the hearing on S.C.R. 1 and entertain a \nmotion from Senator Spearman. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nMay I ask that S.C.R. 1 be amended to add all the cosponsors? \n \nERIC ROBBINS (Counsel): \nYou can add the cosponsors as an amendment to the resolution. \n \n  SENATOR SPEARMAN MOVED TO AMEND AND DO PASS S.C.R. 1. \n \n  SENATOR KIECKHEFER SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \n  THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will open the hearing on Senate Bill (S.B.) 61. \n \nSENATE BILL 61: Revises provisions governing the program for the operation of \nvending facilities by licensees who are blind. (BDR 38-320) \n \nSHELLEY  HENDREN  (Administrator,  Rehabilitation  Division,  Department  of \nEmployment, Training and Rehabilitation): \nI  present  S.B.  61  which  proposes  changes  to  Nevada  Revised  Statutes \n(NRS) 426, the statutes related to the Blind Business Enterprise of Nevada (BEN) \nProgram. I will read from my written testimony (Exhibit B). I have also submitted \nthe proposed amendments to the bill (Exhibit C). \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nI have a question about limiting it to two vending facilities as training sites. Can \nyou explain why it is limited to two, and are you worried that it might affect \nwho is able to participate? \n \nMS. HENDREN: \nWe  are  limiting  it  to  two  because  we  do  not  want  to  have  the  Bureau  of \nServices to Persons Who Are Blind or Visually Impaired take up too many sites \nthat could be awarded to blind licensees. We see the benefit of having training \nsites and people being able to get specific on-the-job training. We offer this and \nsome of our licensees host other trainees, but the idea of a training site is more \ncontrolled, and potential employees can get quality experience there. The limit \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nof two is because if we had viable sites, we want our licensees to own and \noperate them and reap the benefits. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nMy next question is about section 14 in S.B. 61. I understand there is a fee that \nwill be paid, and it looks like the licensees will be paying now. Who paid the \nfees before? It looks like it is an incentive paid by the licensee? \n \nMS. HENDREN: \nYes, it is an incentive, and we wanted to have flexibility where appropriate to \npay incentives. The set-aside fund is strictly limited on what can be paid out; \nincentive is the only means to do so. We modeled this after Tennessee law \nwhere that state is doing this. Licensees cannot be charged typical fees such as \nrent, fees or assessments. We added the incentive to give ourselves flexibility \nwith  our  partners,  if  appropriate.  As  this  section  says,  this  is  optional  and \nnegotiable, and both parties must agree. The Bureau, upon opening a vending \nfacility to a department or agency, cannot be contingent upon payment of an \nincentive. \n \nRICHARD SAPERSTEIN (Chair, Nevada Committee of Blind Vendors): \nI have been in the BEN Program for 33 years. The amendments to NRS 426 are \nimportant. They align the State Program to the federal program and help solidify \nthe  perpetuity  of  the  BEN  Program.  I  do  not  know  how  many  Committee \nmembers know the history of the BEN Program. In 1985 when I began losing \nmy sight, I had no idea what I was going to do. I was college-educated, a \ndistrict manager for a pizza chain, and the food and beverage director at Circus \nHotel Casino. This Program has helped me immensely to become successful and \nmaintain my financial standing. The Program has done this for many others as \nwell. I support the Program in every way I can, and I encourage the Committee \nto  adopt  these  amendments  so  people  in  the  future  will  have  a  solid  BEN \nProgram that will help them achieve the same things it helped me achieve. \n \nIVAN DELGADO: \nI am from Las Vegas and a blind business owner. I have been in the business for \nfive years and it has been a blessing. I finished high school but had not much \nelse going for myself. Luckily, I got to take advantage of the Program. These \namendments are needed and I support the bill. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nDAVID CHERRY (City of Henderson): \nWe met with the bill sponsors to discuss the City's concerns regarding proposed \nchanges in S.B. 61. The amendment presented today begins to address some of \nthe  issues  we  outlined;  however,  we  remain  opposed  at  this  time.  We \nappreciate continuing to work with Administrator Hendren and her team. The \nCity  already  offers  blind  entrepreneurs  in  the  BEN  Program  business \nopportunities  at  multiple  City  facilities  and  recognizes  the  benefits  of  the \nProgram  for  those  it  serves.  Our  main  concern  is  to  retain  a  system  that \nmaintains  the  consent-based  framework  in  the  statutes  when  determining  if \nvending services are needed and, if so, what type. \n \nWe want to see stronger protections when it comes to existing leases obtaining \nwaivers.  There  should  be  certainty  when  people  make  large  investments  or \nenter  into  partnership  agreements  to  operate  the  facilities  on  City  property. \nThese waivers should enjoy statutory protection with a defined process in law. \n \nThere  are  also  concerns  regarding  the  authority  to  void  contracts  that  is \nincluded in S.B. 61. We oppose the change away from the existing 30-day \nnotice period. This has proven sufficient in the past, and moving to a further \nwindow does not provide adequate time to fulfill this requirement. The City \nappreciates  the  bill  sponsor's  amendment  that  defines  an  exception  from \nNRS 426  requirements  when  a  lease  is  granted  to  an  operator  for  live \nentertainment purposes. The amendment offers a narrow definition that could \npreclude private entities that provide different types of activities and levels of \nservice for sizable financial resources. The BEN Program cannot compete with \ntheir sizeable financial resources by its own acknowledgement. \n \nWe urge the Committee to review statute language preserved in the bill that \nmakes it a misdemeanor crime if someone delivers a sandwich or pizza ordered \nby a worker in a building where there is a BEN Program operator who sells the \nsame products. This is outdated and unnecessary. We feel it could also apply to \na parent selling candy on behalf of a child's activity. We think at a minimum we \nshould remove the misdemeanor penalty and handle it through an administrative \nprocess that does not rely on some type of a criminal penalty. The exceptions \nare limited to only certain types of entities that would qualify. While you already \nhave some exceptions that you would think cover the candy sales I mentioned, \nit depends on the type of activity—let us say a dance team or sports activity. If \nthese are not incorporated in a certain way under NRS, they would not enjoy \nthat exemption. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nJOANNA JACOB (Clark County): \nWe  oppose  this  bill  and  have  had  conversations  with  the  Division  of \nEmployment,  Training  and  Rehabilitation  (DETR)  regarding  our  concerns. \nClark County  partners  with  DETR  on  the  BEN  Program,  and  is  working  to \nexpand access within the County wherever we can. Something unique to the \nCounty we need to work through are questions from McCarran International \nAirport, which falls under our County Department of Aviation. The Airport has \ninput from the Federal Aviation Administration on this bill. There are concerns \nraised that we were not able to work through about federal regulations and \nrequirements. Particularly, preemptions are in place with different transportation \nguidelines and concerns because airports are supported by user fees, which are \nusually prohibited from diversion to other purposes. \n \nWe believe we can work this through and have already raised these concerns \nwith Ms. Hendren. We are concerned section 7 was drafted a little broadly, but \nit could be interpreted to apply to existing contracts. We understand it was not \nthe sponsor's intent, and we presented an idea to make that section applicable \nto contracts entered into after this bill passes. \n \nWe  also  have  concerns  about  the  use  of  third-party  vendors.  The  way \nsection 11, subsection 7 was drafted, the language looks like it was going to \nallow  third-party  vendors  to  take  on  licensee  responsibilities.  We  now \nunderstand DETR is looking to narrow third-party vendors, and this section is \nnot intended to open up opportunities to a whole host of third-party vendors. \nWe are going to work on clarification and bring it back to this Committee. \n \nDAVID DAZLICH (Vegas Chamber): \nI oppose this bill. My colleagues at Clark County and the City of Henderson \nhave illustrated well the objections that the Vegas Chamber has with this bill. \nOur concern is for those private entities operating leases on public property, and \nwe too would like to see stronger language protecting the waivers in statute. \nMs. Hendren's amendments are going in the right direction. We look forward to \nremoving our opposition as we work through this bill. \n \nCHAUNSEY CHAU-DUONG (Las Vegas Valley Water District): \nI want to share comments regarding our opposition to S.B. 61. We recently \nsigned  an  agreement  with  the  DETR  BEN  Program  to  provide  services  for \nemployees, and that process went well. A conceptual amendment provided by \nDETR addresses some of the concerns we have. We want to work with DETR \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nregarding section 7, which could still grant DETR exclusive discretion regarding \nwhat locations are appropriate for vending facilities.  Section 11, which requires \npublic entities to cooperate with DETR, makes such a determination. As a public \nentity, we should be able to make these determinations ourselves, particularly in \ninstances when the vending facility exclusively serves employees. The language \nshould be clarified responding to Covid-19; we appreciate the ability to make \nchanges to our limited food service options and to adapt to the pandemic. We \nwould be happy to work with DETR to obtain answers to our questions and \naddress our concerns. \n \nKELLY CROMPTON (City of Las Vegas): \nThe City of Las Vegas opposes S.B. 61 but supports the Program since we have \nbeen  a  partner  and  gone  through  the  process  during  the  construction  of \nCity Hall. We believe the proposed amendment is a good starting point. The \nmajority of our concerns have been addressed by the City of Henderson and \nClark County, so I will leave our opposition at that. \n \nARIELLE EDWARDS (City of North Las Vegas): \nThe City of North Las Vegas opposes S.B. 61 and echoes the remarks made by \nour colleagues from Clark County and the City of Henderson. \n \nSTEVE COHEN: \nI am testifying in a neutral position. Granted this argument is made in a policy \ncommittee, but during Covid-19, most of the government facilities that would \nbe a beneficiary of this Program are closed to the public. I fully support the \ninclusion of people with disabilities in the general workforce. \n \nMS. HENDREN: \nI appreciate the comments and am open to and available to work with those \nentities and hopefully find a solution that works for everyone. Our position is to \npromote the Program and opportunities it provides for individuals who are blind \nto be entrepreneurs Statewide. This is an old Program, having been on the \nbooks for 85 years federally and over 60 years in Nevada. Certainly, I would not \nlike to make changes that do not benefit the Program or blind licensees.  There \nare areas we could clear up and compromises we could make, such as waivers \nand potentially NRS 426.715 regarding misdemeanors.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI did hear from people who were in opposition in advance of the hearing. I want \nto  note  this  hearing  was  scheduled  early  in  the  Session  on  relatively  short \nnotice. I appreciate the interest and the stakeholders working together to move \nthis bill. It is an important Program, and we want to make sure we get it right. I \nhave  asked  the  local  government  representatives  to  work  together.  Perhaps \nthere  could  be  one  group  voice  as  opposed  to  six  or  seven  separate \nconversations. I hope to help our team at DETR make it through the amendment \nprocess. We look forward to hearing back on your resolutions. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRemainder of page left intentionally blank; signature page to follow. \n \n \n \n   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThere being no further questions, we will close the meeting on S.B. 61. \n \nHearing no public comment, the meeting is adjourned at 4:34 p.m. \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n   \nNorma Mallett, \nCommittee Secretary \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nExhibit  Begins \nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \nLetter  on Page \n  A  1    Agenda \nShelley Hendren/ \nDepartment of \nS.B. 61  B  1  Presentation \nEmployment, Training \nand Rehabilitation \nShelley Hendren/ \nDepartment of \nS.B. 61  C  1  Proposed Amendment \nEmployment, Training \nand Rehabilitation \n ", "64": "\nSENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n \nEighty-first Session \nApril 22, 2021 \n \n \nThe Senate Committee on Health and Human Services was called to order by \nChair Julia Ratti  at  3:35 p.m.  on  Thursday,  April 22,  2021,  Online  and  in \nRoom 2134 of the Legislative Building, Carson City, Nevada.

(BDR 40-740) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN CLARA THOMAS (Assembly District No. 17): \nI will read from my written testimony (Exhibit B) which references the report on \n“Racial/Ethnic  Disparities  in  Pregnancy-Related  Deaths—United  States, \n2007-2016” (Exhibit C), and the presentation on Disparate Impacts of Severe \nMaternal Morbidity and Maternal Mortality on People of Color in Nevada from \nthe Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) (Exhibit D). \n \nEDINA FLAATHEN: \nIn 2008, my husband and I were happy to find out we were expecting a baby \ngirl. I went through much of my pregnancy with prenatal care, joyfully prepping \nfor the arrival of our daughter. I had been ill for much of the pregnancy and \nattributed it to morning sickness. I began to notice swelling in my feet and \nankles and asked my obstetrician if this was normal. He stated it was hereditary \nand that my mother may have also had swollen hands and feet when she was \npregnant. As a new mother, I was reading any information I could on pregnancy \nand this did not sound normal to me, but took what she said as truth.  \n \nTwo  weeks  before  my  due  date,  I  saw  a  new  nurse  practitioner  who  was \nconcerned about the swelling and ordered bloodwork and a 24-hour urine test. \nThe next day, I received a call telling me I had preeclampsia and needed to \ndeliver my baby. I went as long as possible attempting to deliver on my own, \nbut ultimately, my blood pressure rose, and our baby was delivered via cesarean \nsection. If not for the practitioner's care and quick thinking, I would have been \nin grave danger. \n \nIn  2010,  I  delivered  a  healthy  baby  with  no  complications  and  had  what  I \nthought was a perfect delivery until I became pregnant with my third child. I had \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 22, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nonce again been sick throughout the pregnancy, but all seemed well until an \nultrasound revealed I had placenta previa. As a precaution, I was monitored \nevery  2  weeks  and  at  27  weeks  experienced  some  concerning  pain.  My \nhusband  took  me  to  the  hospital  where  tests  were  taken  to  figure  out  the \nsource of the pain. I started early labor which was controlled with medication.  \n \nMy high-risk physician was concerned I had been bleeding internally and later \nfound my uterus had ruptured due to a poor surgical procedure with my second \nchild. The delivering physician said it was a miracle I lived. I lost over two liters \nof blood and needed several transfusions. Other than an early delivery, my son \nhas grown into a spunky child with no developmental issues. Due to the work of \nthe delivering physician, I was able to get pregnant a fourth time and delivered a \nhealthy baby girl who is 11 months old.  \n \nI am thankful for the doctors who did not push my concerns aside and provided \nme with the appropriate care.  \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nAre there any specific areas or policies we should look at? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN THOMAS: \nWe are giving the Maternal Mortality Review Committee (MMRC) the mandate \nto assess the information for disparities among our Black and Indigenous women \nwho will die or have complications from pregnancy-related issues. The DHHS \ncan provide any detailed information you would need to assess this provision so \nMMRC can collect the data. If we do not have the data, we cannot access the \ntools required to submit or legislate policy.  \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI continue to hear about cultural competency training while in medical school. \nThere is cultural competency, and there is the culture of medicine. Sometimes \nthe two do not agree. Would that policy help? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN THOMAS: \nRight now, that is one of the biggest issues we have in medicine. Many of our \nhealthcare providers are not looking at women of color. They are putting us all \nin the same category which should not happen. We have different lifestyles, \ngrew up differently, and have differences in the nature of our background and \nheritage,  our  living  conditions  and  the  food  we  eat.  With  Black  and \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 22, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nBrown women, we have a tendency toward diabetes and high blood pressure. \nAll of these should be taken into consideration when looking at and evaluating \nour health conditions.  \n \nMany of the maternal mortality committees I have spoken with have the biggest \nproblem when it comes to providing information to healthcare providers and the \ncommunity in general. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nBased on the presentation from DHHS, Exhibit D, we now have a lot of this \ndata. Would it be fair to look at the bill as including that data to contextualize \nwhat is already in statute—that the MMRC needs to develop recommendations \nfor preventing maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity? Will this bill \ndrive  the  policy  framing  the  debate  to  have  policies  more  specific  to  these \ndisparities? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN THOMAS: \nYes. Because the MMRC exists, they would incorporate and extract data so the \nLegislature can enact policy going forward. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nOne data set not included in the report from DHHS is geographic-based data. \nHas that data been collected, or was it not included in this report? \n \nKYRA MORGAN (Chief Biostatistician, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nWe do have the available data; it was not included in the summary provided. \n \nKATIE ROBBINS (Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada): \nPlanned Parenthood Votes Nevada supports A.B. 119. The United States has \nthe  highest  maternal  mortality  rate  among  similarly  wealthy  countries  with \nBlack women  having  a  maternal  mortality  rate  of  double  their  White \ncounterparts. This statistic is unacceptable.  \n \nWe applaud the MMRC for taking steps to research and address these issues in \nNevada so we can make childbirth a safer process for everyone, no matter your \nrace or socio-economic status. Planned  Parenthood Votes Nevada welcomes \nthese changes to the MMRC and looks forward to working together to address \nthe disparities in our healthcare system. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 22, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nARIELLE EDWARDS (City of North Las Vegas): \nThe City of North Las Vegas supports A.B. 119. The City knows the maternal \nmortality  rate  showcases  significant  and  widening  disparities  in  maternal \nmortality and morbidity, especially in the Black and Indigenous communities of \ncolor. \n \nWe believe the MMRC is essential in an important effort to ensure the maternal \nmortality rate trends downward in Nevada. We urge the support and passage of \nA.B. 119. \n \nSARAH ADLER (Nevada Advanced Practice Nurses Association): \nThe  Nevada  Advanced  Practice  Nurses  Association  (NAPNA)  extends  its \nappreciation and support to the bill sponsor for bringing A.B. 119 in its amended \nform.  I  would  like  to  thank  the  bill’s  sponsor,  and  her  daughter,  for  their \ncompelling testimony that shines a spotlight on why this bill is so important. \n \nThere are members of NAPNA who specialize in maternal health and obstetrics \nproviding care to Nevadans of all demographic groups. The work of the MMRC \nis important to advance practice registered nurses in their practice. \n \nMoreover, NAPNA is highly focused on the health of Nevadans from a public \nhealth perspective; the research, analysis, and collaboration among healthcare \nproviders, the MMRC, and the Advisory Committee of the Office of Minority \nHealth  and  Equity  that  A.B.  119  assures  will  occur.  That  collaboration  will \nproduce  data  on  which  priorities  or  public  health  policy,  action  and  needed \nfunding can be focused. \n \nDASHUN JACKSON (Children's Advocacy Alliance): \nThe  Children’s  Advocacy  Alliance  supports  A.B.  119.  The  development  of \nMMRC will ensure all mothers and youth are being taken care of. \n \nAMBER FALGOUT: \nI am the northern Nevada manager for Battle Born Progress who is in support of \nA.B.  119.  I  am  also  a  mother  and  have  two  biological  children  including  a \nfour-month  old.  During  the  pregnancy  with  my  four-month  old,  I  had \ncomplications  and  know  what  can  happen.  It  is  incredibly  frightening  and \ndifficult  to  work  through.  We  must  find  out  everything  we  need  to  know \npertaining to women of color going through any stage of pregnancy. We must \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 22, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \npush  for  accurate  data  to  change  the  outcomes  we  are  seeing  with  those \npopulations. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 119 and open the hearing on A.B. 426. \n \nASSEMBLY  BILL  426:  Makes  various  changes  relating  to  the  protection  of \nchildren. (BDR 38-516) \n \nGABRIELLE CARR (Court Master, Sixth Judicial District Court): \nThe Nevada Supreme Court Community Improvement Program is a Statewide \nprogram  that  coordinates  with  every  district  within  the  State  to  improve \noutcomes for families in child abuse and neglect situations. I have supplied a \ncopy of the subcommittee member and participant list (Exhibit E) which contains \napproximately 45 stakeholders throughout the State. This list includes judicial \nofficers,  administrators,  child  welfare  workers,  attorneys  and  a  large \ndemographic of stakeholders who deal with child abuse and neglect cases. This \nsubcommittee unanimously agreed to the proposed changes presented in A.B. \n426. \n \nIn  addition,  you  have  a  memorandum  (Exhibit  F)  regarding  the  summary \noverview  of  A.B.  426.  This  is  a  brief  summary  of  why  we  need  the \nrecommended  changes  to  Nevada  Revised  Statutes  (NRS)  432B.  It  was  an \nopportunity to give a comprehensive overview to a Statewide approach with \nlarge and rural jurisdictions being heard and address those changes to the law \nneeded to improve the way these cases are handled. \n \nThere is a new statutory provision related to warrants. A Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals case indicates Statewide that there is no law making it uniform for a \nchild  welfare  agency  to  remove  a  child  from  a  home  where  a  warrant  is \nnecessary. The purpose of that case is to make it more uniform in how the \ncourts implement that requirement. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThere was an amendment referred to earlier, which the Committee is not aware \nof. Was this about the bill itself and the changes it is making, or is there an \nadditional document with additional changes we should be looking at? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 22, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nBUFFY OKUMA (Chief Deputy District Attorney, Washoe County): \nYesterday,  we  were  provided  with  an  amendment  that  has  not  yet  been \npresented. This amendment is likely coming from Kendra Bertschy, which we do \nsupport. \n \nThe  Clark  County  Juvenile  Probation  Office  wanted  us  to  clarify  section  1, \nsubsection  3,  paragraph  (d)  which  provides  for  a  warrant  to  direct  law \nenforcement and others, if necessary, to assist the child welfare agency to \nprovide  safety  when  executing  a  warrant.  They  were  concerned  that  the \njuvenile probation officers in their area do not carry weapons and would not \nnecessarily be in a position to assist with executing a warrant. \n \nThis  section  says  “may”  which  gives  the  court  the  discretion  over  who  it \nauthorizes  to  execute  the  warrant.  We  want  to  leave  the  possibility  there \nbecause  it  may  be  appropriate  for  juvenile  probation  to  assist  in  some \njurisdictions, and in other jurisdictions, it would not be appropriate. We feel the \nlanguage would allow for that flexibility. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nSection 1, subsection 1, at the top of page 3 states “but the threat is not \nimminent in the time it would take to obtain a warrant.” I interpret that to mean \nwe do not think the child is going to be harmed between now and the judge \nissuing a warrant. Is that correct? \n \nMS. OKUMA: \nIn a variety of cases, you have to get a warrant unless there is an exigency and \nthe child would be at risk of harm in the time it would take to get a warrant. We \nhave left the language as is in that respect because in some jurisdictions a \nwarrant can be obtained very quickly based on the technology they have. In \nother jurisdictions, it can take a bit longer to obtain a warrant. While the case \nlaw has been around, the process is still somewhat in its infancy as compared \nto warrants that are obtained in the criminal realm. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWould this language prohibit placing a child in protective custody if they are in \nimmediate jeopardy? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 22, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nMS. OKUMA: \nCorrect. We have many circumstances where an exigency exists and the child is \nin immediate danger and placed in protective custody.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI:  \nIn that circumstance, do they get the warrant after the child has been placed in \nprotective custody, or is the warrant mute at that point? \n \nMS. OKUMA: \nIf  there  is  an  exigency,  and  the  child  is  immediately  placed  into  protective \ncustody, there is no subsequent warrant. Whether there is a warrant or not, a \nhearing must be held within 72 hours, usually in less time than that, and a \nhearing notice is sent to the parents. They are provided counsel, and in most \ncases, it is before the court with a notice hearing. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nWe have a number of children who are in unsafe conditions because of sex \ntrafficking. Would that fall under this, or is this only for children who are in \nfamilial situations? \n \nMS. OKUMA: \nThis would not apply to a child who is a victim of sex trafficking unless the \nperson who is responsible for that child is a parent or other caregiver. There are \ncircumstances under NRS 432B that come within that, but other circumstances \nthat do not. Chapter 432B only deals with children at risk of abuse or neglect \nby a parent or other person responsible for their welfare that has a specific \ndefinition. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIf there is a child or parent who knows the child is going to be removed from \ntheir home and placed in foster care, and knows they have three or four days \nbefore  this  happens,  the  child  could  run  away  or  the  entire  family  could \ndisappear. How do you handle that situation? \n \nMS. OKUMA: \nThose circumstances do happen but are rare as it relates to the circumstance of \na warrant. Jurisdictions are obtaining warrants and have been for several years; \nhowever, we did not have a mechanism within the statute. Once the warrant is \nobtained by the social worker, they attempt to execute it quickly. Sometimes, \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 22, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nbetween  the  time  of  obtaining  a  warrant  and  executing  it,  the  family  does \ndisappear  and they  use all of their resources to try to locate the family to \nexecute the warrant. In those cases, or the exigent circumstance, there is no \nnotice given to the child before the social worker arrives. The same with the \nparents;  the  case  social  worker  or  law  enforcement  generally  provides  the \nwarrant and places the child in protective custody at the time the warrant is \nserved.  \n \nMR. JACKSON: \nThe Children’s Advocacy Alliance supports A.B. 426. This bill is essential to the \nprotection of children. \n \nALEXIS TUCEY (Deputy Administrator, Community Services, Division of Child and \nFamily Services, Department of Health and Human Services): \nThe Division of Child and Family Services is neutral on A.B. 426. \n \nNANCY SAITTA: \nI support A.B. 426. This is a bill that comes with significant support. It is an \nomnibus  bill  that  allows  for  clarification,  updating  and  modernizing  of  our \nstatutory scheme that will make the safety of children and families, and the \nefforts of our judicial officers and other stakeholders, more appropriate to serve \nthe children who need our assistance. This is a bill for which great gratitude is \nrequired. This will allow children and families the protection of a warrant in the \nmovement from and between multiple families and foster care placement in a \nway that protects their dignity.  \n \nThis bill can and will change the latitude or trajectory of our NRS 432B children \nand families and will make a difference for Nevada. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWho will be proposing the amendment that was mentioned? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will address that in the closing of the hearing. I would urge the sponsors to be \nin communication with the Committee between now and any scheduled work \nsession on this bill. If there is an amendment, please let us know so it can be \nreviewed before the work session. \n \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 426 and open it up for public testimony. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 22, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nVALERIE FRISKEY: \nI  am  a  resident  of  Assembly  District  No.  39  and  a  retired  teacher  from \nLyon County. I am active in the Nevada State Education Association and here to \nencourage you to consider the need for all education employees across the \nState to have access to quality affordable health care upon retirement. Our \nmembers are facing escalating costs of health care and prescriptions. Nevada is \na Windfall Elimination Provision, Government Pension Offset State, and many of \nour retired members will not have access to affordable health care because they \nwill not or do not qualify for Social Security and/or Medicare.  \n \nAs my colleagues retire, they incur insurance costs from $800 to $1,000 or \nmore per month after spending their entire careers as public school employees. \nWe  are  aware  of  and  understand  the  State  is  facing  serious  budgetary \nconstraints this year. We are asking the Legislators to fund steady retiree health \ncare for education employees. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nI will reopen the hearing on A.B. 426 for further support testimony. \n \nKENDRA BERTSCHY (Public Defender's Office, Washoe County): \nThe  Public  Defender’s  Office  supports  A.B. 426.  The  proposed  amendment \n(Exhibit  G),  is  to  clarify  language  changes  in  section  4,  subsection  1, \nparagraph (a) where it states “If the person responsible for the child’s welfare,” \nthe  individual  allowed  to  consent  for  the  child  to  be  placed  into  protective \ncustody, is changed to “the parent or legal guardian.” \n \nThis amendment, Exhibit G, is necessary because it clarifies who can consent to \nprotective custody and complies with the constitution. It is the agreed upon \nlanguage the stakeholders discussed during the negotiations for this bill. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nFor clarification; section 4, subsection 1, paragraph (a) is the language change \nof “the parent or legal guardian,” correct? \n \nMS. BERTSCHY: \nYes. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWould the sponsors of the bill consider this a friendly amendment? \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 22, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nMS. CARR: \nThe amendment is language that was originally proposed in Bill Draft Request \n(BDR) 38-516. There was an oversight in the transition from the BDR to the \nactual bill. Our team’s unanimous consent still exists on that amendment. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRemainder of page intentionally left blank; signature page to follow.   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 22, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 426.
