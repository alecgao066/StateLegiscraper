# Leg Text Scraper Design Specification

## Description

The goal of the project is to build a public facing webscrapper tool that makes text transcripts of state legislature committee 
hearing readily available to researchers and members of the public.  In particular, this project has two parts. 

1. Build a tool to scrape all available text transcripts of committee hearing prepares its for text analytics. This 
tool is to publicly available for users to gather raw data

2. Build a dashboard of text analytics to indicate the power of this text corpora, with a focus on 
sentiment analysis and topic modeling of specific committee hearings (that is, policy area across time) OR for specific sessions 
(that is, what’s the most salient topic discussed during a legislative session). We’ll be using nltk, natural language tool kit 
in Python so if you have previous experience or interest in it, this will be a great project for us to collaborate on.

## Motivation

As many members of public may have seen on the news, recent media attention has focused on state legislative politics and a 
number of controversial bills and policy proposals that have emerged in the past few years. But beyond recent news, public 
oversight of the policymaking process is an important cornerstone of democratic nations. As the current U.S. political climate 
has increasingly shifted national politics to the state-level, state legislatures are key policy venues to watch.

However, unlike the U.S. Congress, the 50 state legislatures have vastly different websites and public documentation protocols. 
A systemic examination of national trends at the state-level is difficult to execute due to challenges in navigating and 
accessing data. While projects such as Civic Eagle and Open States have APIs that provide data for bills and representatives 
across all 50 states, there is currently no open source option that scrapes transcripts of committee hearings for research purposes and public review.

## Use Cases

The use case of this tool is to build and make accessible text corpora of political, social, and scholarly significance that can build greater public transparency about public policymaking and state-level politics. Researchers would be interested in this tool to gather raw data, while journalists and members of the public can engage with the dashboard to capture high-level trends in the political discourse at the state legislature.
