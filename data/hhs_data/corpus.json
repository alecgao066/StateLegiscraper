out why.", "I just lost my OB/GYN whom I had for 20 years\u2014same thing.", "Even as we are collecting data about why people re-up their licenses, if there would be any way you could find out why

there a way to collect this data electronically?", "For the record, could you tell us how that will be implemented?", "John Packham: There are a variety of ways that can be done technologically.",

that would take you to the Department of Health and Human Services where you would complete a survey we would have available.", "When you complete that survey, you would return back, provide your credit card information, and renew your license with the state of Nevada.", "The whole idea is to make this as seamless as possible so that every two years\u2014for most professions\u2014when you renew your license, you are spending from five to eight minutes providing very valuable information that the State and other agencies would use to inform policy.", "There is a document as an exhibit [Exhibit K].", "It is a background paper put together by about a dozen of us who have been working on this issue.", "It provides some great examples of how other states have done this.", "The beauty of this proposed piece of legislation is that we do not have to reinvent the wheel.", "There are a number of state models.", "We received wonderful Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 5, 2021 advice from both the National Conference of State Legislatures as well as from the National Governors Association.", "They have some tried-and-true models out there ready to roll if and when we proceed on this.", "I am confident that this is worth the lift.", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: Are all the boards in a place where they will be able to do this?", "Conversations with different boards at different times indicate they are in different states of data technology.", "I know one board a few years back was still doing paper application renewals because the cost to go to an electronic version was going to be north of $30,000.", "A couple of sessions back, we were trying to figure out how to pool some of those tech needs among some of the smaller boards.", "Just knowing this is a really big swath of boards\u2014and for the legislative record\u2014are all the boards going to be in a place where they will be able to dovetail into the system you are talking about?", "John Packham: My honest answer would be no, they will not all be in the same place.", "By my count, there are 28 boards that license or regulate anywhere from 7 to 75 professions, and they are all over the map in terms of the software they use for licensure renewal.", "Some still do pencil and paper, et cetera.", "Again, I am hoping that the way this bill has been crafted or proposed is one that is mindful of those differences and allows boards to implement this, phase this in as they see fit, and with enough time to take into account those variations.", "If you have seen one licensing board, you have seen one licensing board.", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: I appreciate the honesty of that, because in looking at the end of the bill, I see we have different implementation dates for different sections.", "It looks like you have done an assessment of the boards, so depending on where the boards are at, you are addressing different implementation dates.", "Is that why we are seeing different ones except for the boards that are already doing renewals and licensing electronically?", "They can dovetail into this sooner, and those still using paper will need to figure out a way to get to an electronic base.", "They have until July 1, 2022.", "John Packham: Another thing I would point out is that the time in which health professionals renew their license varies from board to board.", "Some are on a yearly basis and some are every other year, I believe.", "With the state Board of Medical Examiners, you renew your license every two years by June 30.", "The way to think about this is that the data will not start rolling in immediately.", "It will be phased in over the next couple of years, but in two or three years, we will begin to have some solid data on health professions and not just practice characteristics and sociodemographic characteristics.", "If it is the pleasure of this Committee, we can address some of the concerns raised in a previous question about retirement plans or the likelihood of leaving or exiting the profession and the state.", "Those are important questions.", "The point I want to make is the data capture will not be immediate but will be phased in based on the way each board collects that data and the timeline in which they collect that data.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 5, 2021 Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: For the boards that still need to address the tech issue, does this require them to figure out how to get themselves to an electronic renewal, or would they stay with paper?", "For instance, there could be an insert notification in the renewal letter that says, go to this link and do this survey electronically, until they can afford the cost to do everything online and with all the tech.", "John Packham: I think the answer to that is a qualified yes.", "We need to be flexible in how this is going to be implemented and rolled out.", "Some states have a superagency overseeing licensing, so you are dealing with one type of software and one common way of renewing your license.", "We are different.", "Each board is different, and I think we will have to be flexible and patient in how this is implemented given that variation.", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: That was my question on implementation, but I have another about the specific data being collected.", "For the record, in section 5, subsection 1, paragraph (f), the working hours and location, what are you looking for in that?", "When a licensee goes to complete that, is that going to be a qualitative sentence or are you looking for a delineation of their hours?", "John Packham: Let me speak to the general intent of that.", "I did a survey about ten years ago on registered nurses in the state.", "One of the things I discovered in that survey is that about 15 percent or 20 percent of those nurses worked in a county that was different from where they had their licensure renewal mailed back to them.", "While it is good to know how many licensed physicians or nurses work in a particular county or part of the state, we really need to know where they are practicing\u2014where they are working and the type of employer they are working for.", "Are they working in a hospital or clinic setting or in a public health agency?", "The intent of that type of question is to get a better sense\u2014for example, with respect to a health professional shortage area designation\u2014of whether they are providing care in a medically underserved area?", "What percent of the patient panel of population is on Medicaid, et cetera?", "As we are trying to assess that, we are getting better information on actually where they practice medical care as well as whether the person is providing patient care, because a number of physicians work in administrative or university settings.", "This will give us a better handle on exactly where care is being provided, how much, and what types of populations those professionals are serving.", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: Because the list under NRS 629.031 is so exhaustive, your intent would be that those professions that are listed who work in the health care field would take the survey.", "If they were not working in the health care field, there would not be the assumption that just because their licensing type is listed in here, they are necessarily working in the health care field.", "That is something you would ask first and foremost.", "Some of them are more obvious, like physicians, but some others may or may not be in the health care field\u2014for instance, a social worker.", "Some might be in child welfare and some might be in medical, so I guess you would Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 5, 2021 ask this question first: Are they in the health care field?", "If they are, then you want to capture this data because otherwise it would just be erroneous data you would be collecting from people who are not in the medical field.", "John Packham: Our idea would be to ask every health professional renewing their license, so we could get our arms around that.", "For example, if we are getting data on physicians whose primary specialty is family medicine, it is important to not only know what the universe of family medicine physicians are in the state or in a given county, but from that, how many are actually providing patient care.", "How many have an active license and how many are working full time, because we know that for every 100 physicians in family medicine, maybe 80 percent or 85 percent are actually in direct patient care.", "In that subset, some are working full time, and some are working part time.", "Again, as we try to get our arms around what the capacity of the state is and where we may or may not have gaps in provider coverage, this type of data will really inform that much better than anything we currently have.", "I can tell you how many family physicians are licensed in Clark County; I have no clue what the full-time equivalent of that number is providing direct patient care or serving Medicaid patients or working in medically underserved areas, and so forth.", "We need answers to those questions.", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: I appreciate that.", "You keep using the example of physicians, and this is why I am asking for the record because that list refers to all of the healing arts.", "You are not just looking for a subset of the healing arts, you mean the entire list of everyone in NRS 629.031.", "Since I got a firm yes on that, I am thinking that, with some of the licensing types such as social workers, it is anyone who is licensed by the Board of Examiners for Social Workers, but not all of them work in health care.", "Therefore, once you get the data, you will clean it up so that not everyone who is working in child welfare or working in anything other than health care is represented as a part of a workforce that indeed they are not a part of.", "John Packham: Correct.", "We are interested in the state's primary care capacity, and that does not mean just family medicine or internal medicine doctors.", "It also means getting our arms around advanced practice nurses and physician assistants who we know are critical to primary care capacity in our state.", "If your profession would have that kind of variation\u2014how many are practicing, how many are providing patient care versus administrative work, and so forth\u2014I think the answer to that question is, yes.", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: There are a couple of others like music therapists in there.", "They may or may not be in a medical setting.", "There is another one, I think it is a sports trainer, who may or may not be in a medical setting\u2014there were just a couple I was not quite sure about.", "I believe we should flesh out on the record what you were trying to scoop up and the scope of it, because it will be a lot of people to these licensing boards.", "My licensing board asks me about the county I work in, the kind of work I do, the institution I work for, and those kinds of things.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 5, 2021 For some of the professions, a lot of this will not be new.", "I am thinking about how I am going to answer a lot of these things, such as working hours and locations.", "I might spend part of my time outpatient and part of my time inpatient.", "I guess you would want to know how many hours I am in the hospital versus how many hours I am at the office versus how many hours I am spending in patient homes.", "I would just report that.", "I assume you will give me a freeform box to report that as more of a qualitative response, as opposed to just a drop-down box with numbers; then you will sort all that out.", "John Packham: The way to think about that phrasing [unintelligible] we could capture that data are to be determined.", "The standard methodology in this line of research is to phrase the question, \"In a typical work week, how much of your time is involved with direct patient care, administrative work, et cetera?\"", "I am hoping that the bill is not overly prescriptive on the wording of questions, questionnaires, and so forth.", "Again, going back to the original plan A, finding out how many providers\u2014regardless of what field they are in\u2014are providing direct patient care.", "Chair Nguyen: I want to remind Committee members that this is a bill that came out unanimously from a work session from the interim Legislative Committee on Health Care.", "There is an interim committee report available on the Nevada Electronic Legislative Information System that I would encourage our members to reach out and look at.", "There is a work session document that has some of this in the minutes from a discussion of this bill as well.", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: That is an important point.", "I also think it is important to note that the legislative record we create in committee is the legislative record.", "We do not have a precedent for referring to interim committees and the work they do as legislative record.", "It may be helpful for us, but the only formal actions we take are when we are in session, so I always think it is helpful to ask these kinds of questions for the record.", "If you do not ask how it is going to get done, this is the only place where bodies, boards, the people who write regulations, can look back for direction.", "Chair Nguyen: I do not disagree, and I am not discouraging questions and creating a legislative history.", "I just wanted to make sure the Committee members knew that.", "It was left out during the introduction of the bill, and I know the interim committee wanted to make sure that was also included on the record in case people had some additional information they wanted to look at\u2014those other discussions that occurred during the interim.", "Again, I would encourage anyone to ask questions and create that legislative history, because I agree that we do need to have the intent clearly on the record.", "Do we have any other questions from Committee members at this time?", "Seeing none, we will begin testimony in support of S.B.", "379 (R1).", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 5, 2021 Senator Julia Ratti, Senate District No.", "13: I was the vice chair of the interim Legislative Committee on Health Care.", "It was chaired by Assemblywoman Lesley Cohen.", "This particular item came forward specifically because of an experience with one of our federally qualified health care centers in Washoe County.", "They have been able to use one of the wonderful programs from the federal government to do loan repayments to some of the health care professionals.", "Unfortunately, because Nevada did not have sufficient data to be able to compete well, when the time came around to renew that kind of program that helps us recruit health care providers, and specifically health care providers to serve low-income and underserved populations, we did not have the data, we did not compete well, and we lost that program.", "I want to underscore that this is not just about collecting data but absolutely about collecting enough data to be able to compete well and to know where we need to invest our resources and energy, but also to be able to draw down some federal resources so we can recruit providers, particularly into hard-to-serve communities.", "Chair Nguyen: Is there anyone else to testify in support of S.B.", "379 (R1)?", "Joelle Gutman Dodson, Government Affairs Liaison, Washoe County Health District: We wanted to thank Dr. Packham and Senator Hardy for staying the course with this bill throughout the session.", "We are really pleased with [unintelligible] this session.", "As the good doctor said, knowledge is power, and the more we know about where providers are and are not, the better we can work to serve our communities.", "We believe this will help health outcomes in Nevada and, therefore, improve the public health of Nevadans.", "Thank you for allowing me to testify.", "We urge your support.", "Bradley Mayer, representing Southern Nevada Health District: I am echoing Joelle Gutman Dodson's comments, and we want to thank Dr. Packham and Dr. Hardy for bringing this bill forward.", "We think collecting this data can have a meaningful impact on how we deliver health care in Nevada, so we urge your support of this bill.", "Chair Nguyen: We will go to our next caller in support.", "[There was no one.]", "At this time, I will begin testimony in opposition to S.B.", "379 (R1).", "[There was none.]", "Next, I will go to neutral.", "Is there anyone to testify in neutral to S.B.", "379 (R1)?", "Kyra Morgan, Chief Biostatistician, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services: I wanted to provide a little bit of clarity on data collection.", "The idea behind data collection is that the survey would be created and maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), and my office would be involved in that process.", "A simple web link to that survey would be provided to the health professionals upon renewal of their licenses.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 5, 2021 This is an important piece of clarity because it really would just require\u2014from a technical perspective\u2014the person renewing their license to have access to either a computer or a smart phone in order to be able to follow that link and complete the survey.", "There really is no technical requirement from the perspective of the survey distribution on behalf of the boards with the exception of just making that link available to their members.", "The data would then be submitted via an individual following that link.", "They would be taken to a page to complete the questionnaire, and the responses to those questions would be directed back to DHHS without actually having to be received by the boards themselves.", "I think that not only eliminates a lot of workload from the perspective of a technical requirement of the boards, but also eliminates concern that those responses could be used in any negative way in regard to confidentiality of the data.", "I wanted to make those clarifications.", "Chair Nguyen: Ms. Morgan, will you please hold on for a minute.", "I want to see if our Committee members have any follow-up questions for you specifically.", "Do we have any follow-up questions for Ms. Morgan?", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: The responsibility of the board would just be to make the link available to their licensees; that is a good distinction because I was worried that our boards were going to have to stand up an electronic web base.", "Some are moving there, but some are not, so we could inadvertently be causing some of the smaller boards to really get their tech in line, which typically means more licensing fee increases.", "Would that happen in the time frame this implementation date was looking at?", "As long as they provide the information to their licensee, which could include a piece of paper\u2014a notice\u2014in their renewal notice, then the board has met its obligation for this legislation.", "Kyra Morgan: That is correct.", "The idea was that we would take the burden of maintaining the survey away from the licensing boards.", "We would cover the technical aspect of that, and anyone with access to a smart phone or computer would be able to follow that link and submit their data directly to DHHS.", "Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: I am learning today that all the boards do not have full web capability, but would the link be available somewhere on their websites even if they do not have the ability to have online renewal?", "I heard Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson speak about a piece of paper, but often people go to websites to look things up.", "Is that possible, and will you be able to help those boards maintain that link to make sure it is fresh and functional in addition to any physical papers they might share with their board members?", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 5, 2021 Kyra Morgan: Similar to what Dr. Packham stated earlier, there are a number of ways we can accomplish this.", "I think the bill keeps it broad and does not prescribe exactly how it will be done, but absolutely, yes.", "Once the survey is created and a link is provisioned, that link could be distributed via an email list, it could be printed in hard copy, or it could be posted on a website; there are a number of ways that could be distributed.", "From a technical perspective, how that works is, as we update the survey, as long as we keep it at that link, maintenance as far as where that link is stored is extremely minimal.", "The short answer is yes, but we do not have the exact details worked out.", "There are a number of mechanisms we could utilize.", "Chair Nguyen: Do we have any other questions from Committee members?", "Seeing none, let us continue with additional testimony in neutral on S.B.", "379 (R1).", "Margot Chappel, Deputy Administrator, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services: This data is important to the HPSA designations that our office is responsible for periodically for the Health Resources and Services Administration at the federal level, and it will greatly assist us in creating that data and reporting it more easily on a regular basis.", "Chair Nguyen: Is there anyone else on the line who wishes to testify in neutral?", "[There was no one.]", "With that, I will turn this back over to Senator Hardy for any closing remarks.", "Senator Hardy: This is a committee bill that came out of the interim, and Senator Ratti is really the one responsible for it.", "I do not want to claim any responsibility or any accolades, because all of this was committee work.", "Chair Nguyen: With that, I will close the hearing on S.B.", "379 (R1).", "Next, we will move to Senate Bill 391 (1st Reprint).", "Senate Bill 391 (1st Reprint): Revises provisions relating to dentistry.", "(BDR 40-455) Senator Julia Ratti, Senate District No.", "13: As the vice chair of the interim Legislative Committee on Health Care, I am bringing forward to you another bill that passed out of that committee unanimously.", "This bill has been through quite the journey.", "Chair Cohen and I recognized at the beginning of the interim that Nevada has significant struggles when it comes to oral health care.", "The interim committee had voted to focus on a couple of areas, and we chose oral health as one of the areas it was appropriate for us to focus on because of the significant negative outcomes in Nevada when it comes to oral health care.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 5, 2021 I did not know that we have a State Dental Health Officer within the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) until last session, so we went to our State Dental Health Officer and asked her to help us with a survey of best practices across the nation when it comes to oral health and places where we could move the needle when it comes to oral health care.", "Dr. Antonina Capurro did some phenomenal work.", "She brought forward a package of things we could consider, and we had a couple of good days of hearings on oral health during the interim.", "Then there was the pandemic, so coming into this session, we knew that we probably would not have very much success with anything that had a significant fiscal note.", "During the interim, we pared that list back significantly and eliminated most of the things that had fiscal notes, knowing this was not the time to be looking at significant expansions of programs or services.", "What we were left with were two very important pieces where we could move the needle on oral health care.", "One is focusing on oral health professionals\u2014the whole spectrum including dental hygienists, dental therapists, or dentists and their roles in response to an emergency.", "One thing we have learned during the pandemic is that we have this whole field of professionals who could lean in; but when it comes to oral health, we have very little infrastructure built in terms of an emergency management structure\u2014very little training, very little identification of who is available and how they could be available\u2014and that was something we needed to rectify.", "That was the first piece.", "The second is that our state and our Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) lag when it comes to the concept of teledentistry.", "We have done a lot of work in this legislative body over multiple sessions on telehealth, and telehealth has certainly seen a dramatic expansion and acceleration of acceptance during the pandemic, but we had not done a lot of work on teledentistry.", "As a result, we wanted to update the statutes when it came to teledentistry.", "Those are the two concepts that came out of the interim Legislative Committee on Health Care.", "I am going to ask Dr. Capurro to walk through those sections, because most of it is her work that she helped support the committee to work through.", "Since the interim, I have had a couple of conversations with Richard Whitley, the director of the Department of Health and Human Services, about some of the challenges for recruiting the state's own dental health workforce.", "We have two staff in the state of Nevada who support dental health.", "One is our State Dental Health Officer, and Dr. Antonina Capurro is that person.", "The other is a State Public Health Dental Hygienist who works for the state.", "They were structured very differently in statute than were their comparable peers.", "For example, the State Dental Health Officer was structured very differently than the Chief Medical Officer, specifically when it comes to licensing, so we addressed the licensing for the State Dental Health Officer to make it more comparable to the Chief Medical Officer.", "Then, specific to the State Public Health Dental Hygienist, there is a piece in state law that says that if you work as the State Public Health Dental Hygienist, you cannot take any outside work.", "That typically makes sense with our state employees.", "We say if you are going to have a full-time job with the state, you probably should not be doing any outside work with the exception that our State Public Health Dental Hygienist is a part-time position because we have not had the resources to fund it at a full-time level.", "To recruit someone into that position, we are basically saying that we would like to hire that person for a part-time job Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 5, 2021 but the person is not allowed to do any other work to be able to pay the bills.", "That is just impractical on its face.", "I will take you through the parts that are very specific to the oral health staff, and then I will ask Dr. Capurro to take you through the specific sections about telehealth and emergency response in the oral health community.", "If you look at Senate Bill 391 (1st Reprint), section 1 states that the State Dental Health Officer is not required to be a licensed practitioner.", "This is a position that is not sitting in a clinic doing dental health work on most days, so that license is not necessarily appropriate.", "The person could be a licensed dental practitioner: that is one option.", "However, the bill allows for an alternate option which is that the person would have a master's degree in public health and have graduated from a dental health college approved by the Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA) of the American Dental Association.", "The person would have completed a dental health education in a CODA-approved educational facility and would have a master's in public health.", "This would allow for recruitment of someone who might have been working in academia for a while and no longer using their practitioner's license and not updating it.", "It will allow for much greater ease of recruitment from out of state, so when a dental health officer would come here, they would be able to get this license that is specifically created for our State Dental Health Officer.", "Section 1.3 is the section that removes the prohibition on the dental hygienist from having outside work.", "Again, that is now a part-time position, and I think it is only fair that that person be allowed to have other outside work.", "Section 27.5 is the section that authorizes the Board of Dental Examiners of Nevada to issue this limited license for the dentist and dental hygienist, as applicable.", "Section 27.5 also prohibits the holder of a limited license from practicing dentistry or dental hygiene, as applicable, and section 39.5 requires that it be renewed annually.", "Sections 39, 40, and 41 all make the conforming changes.", "I will pause there because those are the sections of the bill that specifically relate to the licensing of the dental health professionals, and ask Dr. Capurro to go through the teledentistry and emergency response sections of the bill.", "Antonina C. Capurro, D.M.D., M.P.H., M.B.A., State Dental Health Officer, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services: I oversee the Nevada Oral Health Program within DHHS.", "I am joined by Ms. Jessica Woods, our Interim State Public Health Dental Hygienist.", "She will also provide additional details on this bill.", "I want to start with some background.", "The landscape of health care is changing, as is our service delivery model, so to adapt to these changes and implement lessons learned from the dental community's response to the pandemic, this bill has been created.", "The components of the bill are built on the foundation that oral health is critical to overall health for individuals of all ages.", "Poor oral health can lead to pain and tooth loss that affects quality of life and can impact employment.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 5, 2021 Research has identified an association between poor oral health and chronic disease conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, and stroke.", "However, in 2019 what we saw was 35.3 percent of Nevada adults reported they had not visited a dentist or dental clinic within the last year, and 23 percent of Nevada adults responded that they experience anxiety due to conditions of their mouth and teeth.", "We know that low-income adults, individuals, and families, as well as racial and ethnic minorities, are disproportionately affected by oral health problems, and the COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated these health care inequities.", "It has led to dental office closures to all but emergency services.", "From March 16, 2020, to May 4, 2020, we had cancellation of school-based preventive touch points.", "There has also been a change in the dental workforce which we may not realize for several years.", "Many of the lessons learned from providing dental care during the pandemic, including the expanded use of teledentistry and inclusion of dental professionals as emergency responders, is addressed in this bill.", "Sections 10 to 16 define the educational and training requirements that are needed for oral health professionals to respond to a public health disaster or any type of state of emergency.", "It also establishes the Committee on Dental Emergency Management.", "These sections are based on the concept that emergencies and disasters strain the state's health resources, and without a more robust disaster workforce, the lives and well-being of Nevadans are at risk.", "Dental practitioners who are well versed in emergency management are deployable health care professionals during a public health crisis, terrorist threat, or natural disaster.", "There are numerous dental professionals who are technically trained to save lives, but who do not have the specific types of training that would be necessary to step in during an emergency or public health disaster.", "This lack of training impairs the state's ability to respond quickly and efficiently to emergencies and disasters, so this training is addressed in these sections.", "Section 17 adds a dental emergency responder to the Committee on Emergency Medical Services.", "The last component in the bill is teledentistry.", "During the 2020 stay-at-home orders, there was an exponential rise in the number of teledental visits.", "In June 2019, there were roughly 102 teledental visits to Medicaid patients.", "That number grew to 934 in May 2020.", "This increase occurred without a framework for safe and efficient utilization of teledentistry.", "Sections 19 to 21 include a teledental exam that meets certain criteria as an option to fulfill school entrance requirements.", "Sections 22 to 27 define what teledentistry is, and sections 28 to 31 require a dental practitioner to follow clinical requirements, ethical standards, and confidentiality of the patient's information during a teledental visit.", "It also outlines the practitioner-patient relationship and outlines it for consent as well.", "Sections 32 to 35 ensure communication complies with all Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act laws, and the patient information is secure and encrypted.", "Section 33 outlines when referrals should be made to ensure that there is adequate in-person care when it is needed.", "Section 34 requires the Board of Dental Examiners of Nevada to adopt regulations governing teledentistry, and sections 37 and 39 outline a one-time teledentistry education course for dental practitioners.", "Section 1.7 and sections 42 to 45 create options for hospital systems in the state to leave the established network of dental professionals that are enrolled in the dental managed care Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 5, 2021 organization to bring those teledental services to individuals who are having a real-time dental emergency at a hospital.", "Sections 19 to 39 and sections 42 to 45 are the sections that establish this framework for teledentistry to reduce those traditional barriers to care, to foster equality, and allow Nevada to leverage new technology that expands access to dental care for all patients in the state regardless of where they are located, a parity with in-person services, practitioner-patient relationship, informed consent, patient record requirements, confidentiality of the information, and referrals and regulations to be created by the Board of Dental Examiners are all outlined in these sections.", "Senator Ratti: I believe that is the entirety of our presentation, and we stand ready for questions.", "Assemblywoman Titus: Thank you for bringing this bill forward.", "I was a member of the interim Legislative Committee on Health Care; however, we never see the bills actually written.", "They are generally just concepts of what the priorities will be for a bill presentation, so I have a couple of questions on the bill.", "Under section 1, subsection 1, paragraph (b), subparagraphs (1) and (2), you are removing the requirement that they be a licensed dentist in the state, so at no time can our dental health officer see patients, practice on anyone, give advice, or consult.", "You are removing from them their ability to practice, or will we ultimately require that they get a license in the state?", "I understand that perhaps you might want to recruit someone who is not currently licensed in Nevada and there may be a delay\u2014the individual might not have a license at the time\u2014but I am concerned that ultimately they may never need a license to practice in the state.", "Senator Ratti: Section 1 creates the alternative path to licensure, and that is where you see the word \"or.\"", "Right now, it has to be someone with a current license to practice.", "Section 1, subsection 1, paragraph (b), subparagraph (2), creates the alternate pathway which is the master's or doctorate degree in public health or a related field and be a graduate of a dental college or residency program accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation.", "That is the accrediting body for educational institutions for oral health.", "Then, if you will follow me to page 19 and section 27.5, this is the section which states, \"The Board shall, without a clinical examination required .", ".", ".", "issue a limited license to a person to practice dentistry or dental hygiene who: (a) Has entered into a contract .", ".", ".", "to serve as the State Dental Health Officer .", ".", ".", "or the State Public Health Dental Hygienist\" and satisfies the requirements of those chapters of NRS and pays the fee.", "Then the bill talks about the limited license\u2014how you get that license; the fee; and then on page 20 at line 21, the bill states: \"Shall not, for the duration of the limited license, engage in the private practice of dentistry or dental hygiene in this State or accept compensation for the practice of dentistry or dental hygiene in this State except such compensation as may be paid to the person by the Division of Public and Behavioral Health .", ".", ".", ".\"", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 5, 2021 You see it there, and it is only within the scope of his or her appointment as the dental health officer or the dental hygienist.", "Section 27.5, subsection 6 is important.", "It states, \"Not later than 7 days after the termination of a contract .", ".", ".", ".\"", "Now they are no longer an employee of the state.", "Subsection 6, paragraph (a) continues with, \"Provide to the Board written notice of the termination; and (b) Surrender his or her limited license to the Board.\"", "If they were interested at that point in going back into practicing dentistry, or maybe practicing dentistry for the first time in the state of Nevada, they would have to apply for and obtain their license to practice.", "It is the combination of section 1 and section 27.5 that lays out what the new path is and what the requirements of the new path are.", "Assemblywoman Titus: Thank you for that clarification.", "I have another question.", "In section 1.7 it reads that if a Medicaid recipient presents to the emergency room, there is a list of dental providers that must be given to them or displayed somewhere.", "In my practice, we always made sure everyone\u2014those who were not on Medicaid, those who were uninsured or underinsured\u2014had follow-up instructions and access to lists of providers we would refer them to whether it was the ophthalmologist, the orthopedist, et cetera, including a dentist.", "Why are you singling out that the Medicaid recipient has to have this list and it has to be posted?", "Senator Ratti: I will turn that one over to Dr. Capurro.", "There were many conversations with providers that resulted in some compromise language, and she had more involvement.", "Antonina Capurro: This language specifically talks about Medicaid recipients because that is the patient pool that we know services are provided for.", "When they come in for a nontraumatic dental emergency right now\u2014someone who is seen at the hospital\u2014there is no definitive treatment that is provided.", "Providing teledental services to that group will ensure that they are able to access real-time care and those services are provided under Medicaid.", "That is why this language has come about, so there is some type of information when in the hospital emergency room and they do not go from that emergency room back to the emergency room when their condition flares up again.", "Adults in the state have dental coverage for emergencies, but we are trying to link them to a provider.", "That is why this is more specific to the Medicaid patient, but I would hope that if the hospital had signage about teledental providers or used teledentistry, any patient in the hospital would become aware of that and would use the services.", "Assemblywoman Titus: I just want to make sure that the Medicaid patient is not seen as getting lesser care because they are forced to use teledentistry, whereas another patient might be referred right to the dentist\u2014an in-person visit.", "I wanted to make sure there was parity there and not that a person who is on Medicaid would have to use teledentistry.", "I am always anxious when Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 5, 2021 a certain subset is provided one avenue and not everyone else is provided with that avenue, or the reverse.", "I needed some clarity that, indeed, there is health care for all patients, and I am not seeing that.", "[Assemblywoman Peters assumed the Chair.]", "Antonina Capurro: We are not trying to change what is provided in the hospital.", "All patients would still have to be triaged in the hospital; this is simply a referral mechanism to ensure that those patients who have this Medicaid benefit are able to receive it.", "It is a type of care coordination.", "Vice Chair Peters: Are there other questions from the Committee?", "Senator Ratti: Having served on many health committees with Assemblywoman Titus, I know where she is going with that line of questioning, and I would be happy to look into it a little bit further.", "I will say that the origin of this is that we have set up a dental provider managed care organization within the state and we see underutilization.", "For whatever reason, our Medicaid patients are not figuring out that they also have dental insurance.", "I do not know if we see that same problem for someone who has their own insurance and knows about their insurance, but we are definitely seeing in the Medicaid market a significant underutilization of a service that we are investing a significant amount of resources into.", "This is really trying to get at that underutilization of our Medicaid dental health benefits, but I am happy to take a look at it and see if we need to expand the language to read that anybody who has a dental emergency should get this list.", "I think that will happen naturally, but that is the genesis of this if that is helpful for context.", "Assemblywoman Titus: Thank you, Senator Ratti.", "That is much appreciated.", "[Assemblywoman Nguyen reassumed the Chair.]", "Chair Nguyen: We will go next to Assemblywoman Thomas.", "Assemblywoman Thomas: My question concerns clarity or understanding.", "In section 13, subsection 5, it reads: A dental responder may not be held civilly or criminally liable for any act or omission performed while providing or supervising the provisions of emergency medical care, immunizations, medical care in a mobile clinic or humanitarian care in accordance with this section and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto unless the act or omission: (a), Amounts to willful misconduct or gross negligence.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 5, 2021 Who determines what is willful misconduct or gross negligence?", "I am not seeing where the patient who is under the care of a dental responder has the ability to tell authorities that they feel like there was misconduct or negligence.", "Senator Ratti: I feel relatively confident that this is the boilerplate language that is in place for all emergency response, so it acknowledges that in an emergency response sometimes our providers are going to need to take emergency action.", "We try to give them some protection\u2014a limited protection\u2014from liability if they are operating within the scope of their license to provide assistance to somebody in an emergency.", "That is the first premise.", "Specifically getting down to the exceptions to that\u2014and these are very important exceptions, so this is not a get-out-of-civil-court or get-out-of-criminal-court-free card.", "It does not amount to that at all because if there has been willful misconduct or gross negligence, or they were under the influence, you lose that liability protection.", "At the end of the day, the decider will be the judge, right?", "Really, this is about if there were a criminal charge filed or if there were a civil complaint, so if that patient perceived he or she had been harmed, the remedy would be to file a civil complaint.", "A judge would look at that civil complaint.", "The judge's starting point would be that there is some limited immunity here because it was an emergency, unless they were under the influence or it meets the standard of willful misconduct or gross negligence\u2014which are legally defined terms that courts are accustomed to working with.", "This is really all about that system\u2014the court system\u2014and the judge would be the person who would decide.", "Chair Nguyen: Ms. O'Krent is on the Zoom now, and I will turn it over to her to confirm what you just mentioned.", "Karly O'Krent, Committee Counsel: That is absolutely correct.", "It would be up to the court to make a determination regarding whether willful misconduct occurred, and \"willful\" is defined in Black's Law Dictionary to have a particular meaning, so that would be interpreted by the court at that time.", "Assemblywoman Thomas: To me, it looks like that patient does not have the ability to seek restitution, but it might be just the way it is worded here.", "That is my opinion.", "Senator Ratti: I appreciate the clarification and the perception.", "It is relatively standard language we have in all our emergency responses.", "It is not my intent to remove a patient's right to seek remedy.", "They absolutely have that right to seek remedy; however, they would only achieve that remedy if there was willful misconduct or gross negligence or someone was under the influence.", "That would be the way to think about it; and thank you for the comment.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 5, 2021 Chair Nguyen: Assemblywoman Thomas, do you have any follow-up questions?", "Assemblywoman Thomas: No, but I appreciate it.", "Chair Nguyen: Do we have any other questions from Committee members?", "Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: If memory serves, we had a bill yesterday in the Assembly Judiciary Committee that talked about removing the dental board\u2014consolidating some of the boards.", "That was really surprising, so I texted my dentist and asked if he knew anything about it.", "How would this bookend into that?", "Senator Ratti: I am not in a position to answer that question because it was not my bill and I have not sat on the committees that heard that bill, so I cannot claim to be familiar with it in a detailed way.", "Legal counsel might want to chime in and explain what happens if two bills pass that are in conflict with each other.", "We certainly have lots of statutes that call out the licensing boards, and if there is a change to the licensing boards, my assumption would be that all the other statutes would have to conform to that.", "Chair Nguyen: Ms. O'Krent, is there any clarification you can give to Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong at this time, or do you need additional time to research those two bills?", "Karly O'Krent: I would need some additional time to

20, and 21 that talk about teledentistry and dental homes and virtual dental homes.", "Section 19 talks about public schools, private schools, and child care facilities that require children to receive dental examinations.", "Then it says that the \"dental home,\" which is a group of people including a dentist, can have a virtual dental home.", "It just has to be a dentist licensed in Nevada.", "I am wondering if it can be a dentist who is licensed in Nevada but living and practicing in, say, Florida or some other state or country?", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 5, 2021 Senator Ratti: Thank you for the question, but I will turn that one over to Dr. Capurro.", "We have learned a lot about telehealth generally and what works well, but I will turn the details on that one over to her.", "Antonina Capurro: It is specified in section 28 that a person who provides teledentistry would need to be licensed in this state, so they would need to be licensed in Nevada.", "What I have seen in other states that have a virtual dental home model is more for a patient who might be living in a rural community where there is not a dentist nearby.", "They are receiving care via teledentistry with the licensed provider in the state they are living in.", "There is also language regarding informed consent that determines that a patient is in the state the dentist is practicing in.", "Assemblywoman Krasner: Because they can have a virtual home, I think dentists can be licensed to practice in more than one state, is that correct?", "If that is true, could the dentist be licensed in, say, Nevada and Florida both, and have a virtual home in Nevada where the dentist does teledental exams on the children, but they are physically located in a different state?", "Is that possible with this bill?", "Antonina Capurro: If the provider is licensed in multiple states but is also licensed in Nevada and following Nevada's statutes and laws, then that would technically be possible.", "The provider would also need to provide referrals, and that is also outlined in the bill.", "If the patient needed care that the dentist could not provide through teledentistry, they have to be aware of the surrounding provider network and refer the patient to care.", "Therefore, the child would not be without a referral network if that was the case.", "Jessica Woods, R.D.H., M.P.H., Interim State Public Health Dental Hygienist, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services: I have worked in this model before, so one thing that might be helpful is to think of us like a hub-and-spoke model where the dentist may be in one location but other members of the dental team\u2014like a dental hygienist or dental therapist\u2014would be out in a rural community collaborating with that dentist.", "Often, the dental hygienist or the dental therapist will be collecting some sort of information such as X-rays or intraoral pictures and sending them back to a dentist who is not actually in that community\u2014maybe not even in the state\u2014but giving the direction to a provider who is actually located there.", "This language would allow for that.", "Senator Ratti: It does end up becoming critically important for a state like Nevada that has so many communities right on the border.", "In some of our eastern Nevada communities, a big chunk of their care might come from Salt Lake City, Utah.", "In our southern Nevada communities, Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 5, 2021 a good chunk of their care might come from across the border in Arizona, or right here where we have some good relationships with our California providers.", "Yes, the model is intended.", "There is nothing

health care spending has been growing by 4 percent to 5 percent annually since 2014.", "The key factor that contributes to increased health care spending is market consolidation and health care providers and facilities.", "According to a new report from the National Academy for State Healthcare Policy, rapid consolidation in nearly every state has created dominant health care systems that use anticompetitive contract practices to charge super competitive Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 5, 2021 prices especially to commercial insurance plans.", "The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to further accelerate this consolidation and, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a large body of research demonstrates that provider consolidation leads to higher health care prices for private insurance.", "Studies also show that consolidation of health care facilities reduces health insurers' ability to keep prices low because they have less market power than the hospitals.", "At the same time, these increased prices have little or no impact on quality of care, utilization rates, or efficiency.", "Nevada currently does not have many tools to review or regulate

care already, and we do not know very much about how the industry is changing.", "We know it is happening; we know consolidation is happening in the markets because we see it in our claims and in our contracts.", "We see it when we see that the hospital system has hired an emergency room (ER) group that now, instead of being owned by ER doctors in Nevada, is owned by a private equity company.",

indicator of increased quality.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 5, 2021 Vertical mergers are when one group buys a lower group in the health care tier such as a hospital buying a doctor group [page 5, Exhibit Q].", "We have some state laws about that in this state, but we also have some cases where doctor groups are being bought by hospital groups.", "That results in higher clinical prices and also results in higher hospital prices and little to no quality improvement.", "Specific ways that this happens is when a hospital buys a physician group, it can then start charging a facility fee for the physician group.", "So you are paying an additional fee for no additional care because of the cost of the facility now when a hospital group buys a physician group.",

incremental change that you do not see at all.", "You just feel it and you pay for it.", "It can take years and tremendous resources to do this through the courts, and so what we are trying to do is increase our opportunity to interrupt the price trends that are going on with eliminating some of the noncompetitive language in our contracts, but also create enough transparency to see what is going on, even if you cannot interrupt it; to see some transparency laws that we do not have right now, and that is our goal.", "Now, Maya Holmes will talk about the bill itself.", "Maya Holmes, Healthcare

systems work is very confusing.", "I struggle to figure out where I can go and where I cannot go, but my concern is that right now under the current system, I have a fairly comfortable way of navigating when I go to the hospital that some of these things are going to be covered.", "It appears under this bill the intent is to actually break that up.", "If I end up at a hospital that is not in my plan, the radiologist group may or may not be covered under this plan, and that draws some very serious concerns to me.", "Maybe you can address why that is a benefit.", "I look at a one-stop shop as being of much more benefit to the patient, including myself, than having to go to a hospital, check in, and then be sent to a radiologist group clear across town or, in my case, possibly to another town.", "Bobbette Bond: That is not where this bill is intending to go.", "Where this bill is intending to go is if you are in negotiations with a hospital and you know the quality scores or the price at that hospital is higher and lower in quality than other hospitals, then you want to be able to negotiate a rate with that hospital that takes that into account, or you can negotiate a different rate for one hospital than for another.", "That is one thing we would like to do in our contracts, so that is why we talk about it in monopoly terms.", "The language that is being [unintelligible] into contracts does not let us do that.", "We are not trying to eliminate the hospital from the contract, we are trying to be able to steer people to it in different ways.", "If it is the most expensive contract we have, then we would tell our patients that they can go to the other two places for less money.", "We would tell them, This is your cost share; it is lower Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 5, 2021 somewhere else, or it is better quality; or you would be able to work with one hospital and their special women's health program.", "That is a real example we are dealing with right now.", "It is not about breaking up the hospital and doctors at all.", "It is more that we want to eliminate the language that does not allow us to send a patient to

here.", "It is saying that you can have all these choices.", "If you go to radiologist A, it is going to cost you this; if you go to radiologist B, it may cost you this.", "Some of our contracts

20.9, subsection 1.", "HCA Healthcare does not do section 20.9, subsection 1, paragraph (a).", "They do not do paragraph (b), and they do not do paragraph (e), so what we are going to focus on are paragraphs (c) and (d).", "With regard to paragraph (c), we believe that the provider should be explicitly permitted to offer incentives in the contract bargaining process to include those of its own entities in the contract or in the same tier.", "Proponents seemed to imply that they thought that to be the case, but the lawyers I have talked to who have read this believe that this may prohibit that from happening.", "We would like to have explicit language allowing the provider to offer such incentives.", "This would enable a higher volume of patients and thus enable a more discounted rate.", "It would also permit coordination of care.", "Hospital Corporation of America has consciously put together a system which enables the providers to get the patients to the right place for the needed treatment in a timely manner, thus seamlessly to the patient.", "We would like to explicitly know that is permitted, and why that is important is that, at the end of this bill, it says a violation of this section is a felony.", "This language is pretty vague.", "We have already had discussions about what it means.", "It is very important that a normal bargaining process not get you into a situation where you can be accused by an aggressive attorney or aggressive opponent of committing a felony.", "With regard to section 20.9, subsection 1, paragraph (d), similarly, providers should be able to incentivize the payor to contract with affiliated groups.", "Those groups that provide your radiology treatment, your anesthesiology treatment, your hospitalists, having these together is essential to providing the continuity and coordination of care as well as preventing the difficult situation that can happen when a patient thinks he or she is going to an in-network hospital, and then wakes up after surgery to find out that the anesthesiologist or the radiologist or the hospitalist is in a different network, and all of a sudden they are paying out-of-network charges.", "Plus, when you do not have that connection, you have much less coordination, much less cooperation.", "We would love to see that section cut out altogether, but if not, it should be changed to explicitly permit the provider to incentivize the payor in the bargaining process to contract with affiliated groups as necessary for profit continuity, coordination, and integration of care.", "Without that, this puts the patient in a very difficult situation.", "It is my understanding that the [unintelligible] which was referred to, actually allows hospitals to ask for contracts with doctors providing services in that area or at that hospital for the reason of continuity of care.", "Essentially, failure to fix section 20.9, subsection 1, paragraphs (c) and (d), as we are asking, will leave the patients in a very difficult situation.", "They would be facing a fragmented, disorganized, confusing medical environment in terms of both health care and figuring out their billing.", "I know there are certain payors, and we have heard from one of them extensively here today, who probably takes their patients almost by the hand and guides Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 5, 2021 them around, but the vast majority of Nevadans are not in that situation.", "They are left to do this on their own, and now that neither I nor my wife are as young as we used to be, we are doing a lot of health care.", "It is quite a confusing situation.", "Having everyone at least in the same network certainly would make life exceptionally easier.", "Finally, antitrust violations should not constitute a felony.", "Antitrust cases are typically civil cases.", "The language in paragraphs (c) and (d) is ambiguous and open to very varied interpretations.", "To make trying to achieve a situation where the doctor groups serving a hospital are not in a payor's network a felony is a recipe for much worse and expensive care as well as a very anxious and confusing world for the patient.", "The beginning statements talked a lot about health care costs, and this is a way to bring down health care costs.", "But I think I have the right to say that the single most important thing this Legislature and the advocates of this bill could do to bring down their health care costs is to join together with all of us and convince the Legislature to increase Medicaid reimbursements to providers.", "The single reason why those costs are so high is because we have to shift such a large amount of cost onto the commercial and trust fund payors.", "It is very simple.", "Katherine Gudiksen talked about how much health care costs have gone up.", "Well, since 2001, hospitals have gotten one raise in Medicaid rates\u20142.5 percent\u2014which was taken away from us last summer.", "That is all we have gotten.", "If you wonder why costs are going up, that is a very, very large reason.", "Chair Nguyen: Are there any follow-up questions?", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: Going back to the same question about section 20.9, subsection 1, and the \"shall nots\" and paragraphs (a) through (e), it looks as though paragraphs (a), (b), and (e) are off the table and we are focusing on paragraphs (c) and (d).", "Could you talk a little more about the practices that are allowed now that will become the \"shall nots\"?", "What it will allow from your perspective.", "George Ross: I cannot speak for any other company on that and I am not the negotiator on ours, but I can tell you that we do not require them all to be in the same tier, and we do not require them all to contract with all our entities.", "However, we would like to be able to incentivize them to do so if we chose to.", "If we could give them an incentive good enough for them to do it, we would love that.", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: Perfect.", "George Ross: Hopefully, they would find the lower price we could give them for that volume to be attractive as part of the bargaining process.", "We just want to make sure that the normal bargaining process, because of the way this bill is worded, is not suddenly becoming a crime.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 5, 2021 Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: I appreciate that.", "Again, going to incentives to make sure we are clear for the record: In the way we have been talking about it, it seems to mean financial incentives.", "Is that right?", "George Ross: Yes.", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: Therefore, section 20.9, subsection 1, paragraph (d), is contracting with affiliates.", "Obviously, if a hospital wants to say, Here is the hospital network we have built out.", "We have the hospital, we have the clinics, we have an urgent care, and we have specialties, so the idea would be to incentivize people to stay in the hospital network.", "That would be contracted and negotiated\u2014the incentive to stay in, versus the way it is being talked about right now\u2014the status quo.", "You are all in the hospital's network or you are not.", "George Ross: We do not mandate that, but we like to incentivize it.", "In terms of section 20.9, subsection 1, paragraph (d), the way we read that, it refers to affiliated entities.", "It is not necessarily the ones we own.", "In this case, we believe that means, the way our lawyers and negotiators write it, it is talking about the doctors' group that we made a contract with to do their radiology.", "The doctors' group we made a contract with to do the ER, and so on\u2014all the places where you get a doctors' group to do it.", "It is a real mess when all of a sudden you have to pay out of network when you are in a network hospital.", "From a patient point of view, those are the kinds of things where a patient would say, What does this bill mean?", "Why do I have this?", "Why do I have that?", "It can drive you crazy.", "This will make life a lot simpler, a lot more organized, but more importantly, it will help coordinate care.", "When the hospitals work with these groups where they have contracts, they can interact and coordinate.", "The best example I can give you of some of this is when I had an operation at MountainView Hospital on my elbow.", "I had my stitches out.", "The next morning there was a lot of blood in my bed.", "I got in my car and drove down the freeway to Southern Hills Hospital & Medical Center's ER.", "It took me about 10 or 15 seconds to get in there because all my information was right there in their computer system.", "They had everything they needed.", "It was very coordinated.", "They could see everything that happened to me right there.", "I respect what the proponents are trying to do here.", "They have a noble objective, but we want to make sure that our ability to provide the best possible care we can in a coordinated manner to the patients and give them as good an experience as possible is not inadvertently or advertently eliminated by the way this bill is worded.", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: I should clarify.", "When I was talking about the hospital and their network and I was referencing the buildings, we know that very few people are hospital employees.", "They have the brick and mortar then hire the physician groups to come in.", "You might have Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 5, 2021 administration\u2014payroll and human resources and maybe some others tend to be direct employees\u2014but maybe 10 percent of the people you see in a hospital are actually employees of that hospital and the rest are contract groups.", "George Ross: The nurses are all employees.", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: Yes.", "When I am talking about specialty clinics, urgent cares, it is the groups that are staffing those.", "In section 20.9, subsection 1, paragraph (e), it says they shall not do exclusive contracting, so those provider groups will be contracting with multiple entities as well, which I think they can do now because we have some case law on that.", "George Ross: That is correct.", "We have no problem with doing that; we do not stop them from doing that.", "We have no problem with that piece of the bill.", "If there is a group that wants to contract with two or three different hospital groups, fine.", "Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: This is really complicated, and our intent is to do the right thing for our constituents.", "This bill, if I am not mistaken when I listened to the earlier testimony, does not allow for there to be fines and fees if people do not comply.", "If there is no vehicle for fines and fees, and the only vehicle that is allowed here is a felony, what else can be done?", "I think we have seen enough corporate misbehavior.", "Often when people are fined, they continue poor behavior because they can afford to pay.", "It may seem egregious, but if you have a suggestion about how we can get people to comply, I would like to hear it.", "George Ross: You can always make it a misdemeanor and not a felony.", "Ideally, you could put fines in.", "You could put penalties in there but even then, we would think.", "If you just allow normal bargaining\u2014because several times the proponents referenced that is part of the bargaining of the contract\u2014if you can just put in here that we are allowed to incentivize those two items I talked about, we would not have any worries and we would not be worried about getting a felony because we would not be breaking the law.", "We do not do section 20.9, subsection 1, paragraph (a), we do not do paragraph (b), and we do not do paragraph (e).", "We just want to make sure that we can continue to provide coordinative, high-quality care that is good for the patient and puts the patient in a good place without committing a felony.", "Chair Nguyen: If I could just clarify, Mr. Ross, NRS Chapter 598 already has those violations go to district court.", "I believe that is existing statute.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 5, 2021 George Ross: I am not an attorney.", "Chair Nguyen: I will ask Ms. O'Krent because I believe that is already existing in the statutes, so this is not a new provision.", "Ms. O'Krent, can you clarify that, or do you need additional time?", "Karly O'Krent: That is correct.", "Chair Nguyen: I just wanted to make sure the record was clear that is language that already exists in NRS Chapter 598.", "George Ross: I have done a lot of health lobbying up here for two decades, and every time you change the health care law, it shows up in about one little blue line in about seven or eight very long paragraphs because there are all these different kinds.", "I am not a lawyer, but maybe we could put it in a different section and get rid of it that way.", "If that is what it requires, make a new section.", "Chair Nguyen: We have another question from a Committee member.", "Assemblywoman Krasner: Thank you, Mr. Ross, for being here.", "This is a complicated bill, but I do know that when people get sick or their loved one gets sick, they want the state-of-the-art hospital.", "They want the best doctors, but here in Nevada, we have one of the lowest Medicaid reimbursement rates in the United States.", "In the special session, we reduced Medicaid reimbursement rates an additional 6 percent.", "How will those factors, coupled with this bill, affect our state and health care for the people in our state?", "George Ross: I do not think it will help.", "If it passes as written, I think it will have a negative impact on how people receive health care and how people experience health care for the reasons I stated.", "The best thing we can do to improve health care in this state is to increase the Medicaid reimbursement rate.", "You need to pay doctors enough to take Medicaid patients.", "We are very low on medical, but when you drive through Henderson or you drive through parts of Summerlin, you are not seeing any shortage of doctors.", "Where you see the shortage of doctors is in east Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, and northeast Las Vegas.", "Where do the majority of the folks who are on Medicaid live?", "Those same places I just listed.", "You need to pay the doctors enough that they will take and see Medicaid patients, and similarly, if you pay the hospitals a somewhat fair rate\u2014comparable to other states.", "I know it was said Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 5, 2021 earlier, but we have at least five entities that own hospitals in Las Vegas.", "It is fairly competitive when you do those contracts.", "It is one reason why someone apparently tries some of these other things to get an edge.", "It is quite competitive, so it will not take long if you start raising the Medicaid reimbursement rates when the cost-shifting gets less and the contracts to the payors go down.", "We do not like having to do that, but if you do not push those rates up, a hospital does not survive.", "Chair Nguyen: Mr. Ross, can I get you to direct this toward the contents of this bill?", "I know we have other people who want to testify here as well, so we will go to the lines for testimony in opposition to S.B.", "329 (R1).", "James Wadhams, representing Nevada Hospital Association: I would like to thank Senator Lange for the time she spent talking openly to the sponsors of the bill.", "That has been a very open and robust discussion.", "The bill with its amendment is much improved.", "We do still have some concerns, and it is part of the reason we have been addressing these questions.", "There is not only a felony potential, but there is a private right of action, treble damages, and attorney's fees, so this element of section 20.9 is very serious.", "It has to be precise.", "Many of the Committee members' questions have drawn attention to the ambiguity, for example, in the phrase in what we have just been talking about in section 20.9, subsection 1, paragraphs (c) and (d) on business affiliates.", "Does that mean the affiliation of the in-house basic hospital services, such as lab and radiology and anesthesiology, or is that a reference to external, but affiliated, facilities?", "That needs to be clarified for all the reasons of the treble damages and the felony.", "The other element is making sure of the language.", "If the Committee will look at section 20.9, subsection 1, I think there is a concern that there may be ambiguity in the way that language is written that a restriction on changing the incentives after the contract is entered into may be barred as well.", "I do not think it was the sponsors' intent nor, clearly, was it Senator Lange's intent; I do not think from what we have heard from the proponents that was their intent.", "I think the language needs to be clarified in that regard.", "Finally, I think it would be worthwhile at least to have committee counsel take a look at the reference to a third party when we are actually talking about a hospital or a provider/physician provider entering into a contract with the payor.", "They are counterparties to the same contract.", "One is not an unrelated third party.", "The technical elements of this and eliminating antitrust provisions by themselves are not the problem that we have with this bill.", "It is making sure that it is clear and does not impede the open contracting that otherwise occurs in this highly competitive environment.", "Again, I appreciate the opportunity to testify and thank you, Madam Chair.",

the Office of the Attorney General can deal with bad actors.", "St. Rose also does not mandate that payors contract with our entire network.", "The contracting restrictions piece of the bill in section 20.9 is severely problematic and will make navigating health care coverage even more difficult for patients while also creating access-to-care and quality issues by interrupting the continuum of care.", "This could also be harmful to health equity.", "There is nothing in this bill that would prevent payors from making their members go to the cheapest place of care and not giving them a choice.", "How is this confusion and frustration better for the patient?", "This benefits the payor's bottom line, not the patient.", "That being said, St. Rose is willing to work with the sponsor on this bill in conjunction with the Nevada Hospital Association and hopes we can come to a resolution.", "Dan Musgrove, representing Valley Health System: I will not be repetitive.", "George Ross, James

increasing Medicaid rates.", "We are a small hospital compared to others in Las Vegas and have just one location in Las Vegas; therefore, the ability to have as much flexibility with our contracting

industry on the bill and working to determine if there were unintended consequences that could be corrected in the bill language.", "We do, however, oppose S.B.", "329 (R1) as amended as the majority of our concerns have not yet been addressed.", "Our primary concerns include the following: We believe payors and providers should be allowed to negotiate and mutually agree on contract terms.", "Senate Bill 329 (1st Reprint) prohibits parties from negotiating certain terms that may result in providers not being able to offer their best volume discount if they cannot confirm the payor's members will not be directed away from them.", "In addition, as an integrated delivery system, Renown Health provides value to its patients and those employer groups and payors we contract with by being able to provide high-quality care in the most cost-effective setting, including this past year during the COVID-19 pandemic where we provided care in the patient's home when it was appropriate.", "Excluding or steering patients around the components of our delivery system has the potential of diminishing our ability to meet the patient's needs.", "By connecting the components of

outline of this measure.", "The second part of this measure relates to expansion of services and access.", "Primarily, sections 4 and 8 through 16 compel private payers to reimburse providers on the same basis as the insurer provides coverage and reimbursement for health care services provided in person.", "Medicaid is already required to reimburse providers.", "Audio-only service is excluded from this reimbursement provision, but the technology is recognized as an allowable modality.", "The Commission voted to recognize that reimbursement should be kept on par with in-person care to give reluctant providers a reason to try telehealth and spur widespread adoption with the goal of increasing access.", "This legislation will encourage providers and patients to use virtual care alternatives to increase access to care.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 7, 2021 As Chair Nguyen mentioned, the reprinted version of the bill includes Amendment 174, which was adopted and voted out unanimously by the Senate.", "It includes several provisions.", "There was an amendment from DHHS removing their fiscal concern related to the creation of the data dashboard, providing clarity there was no intent to have an unfunded mandate and recognizing there are resources the Department needs to have available in order to comply with this request.", "The adopted amendment addresses their fiscal concerns, and there is no fiscal impact to the state considered on this measure.", "The other four adopted amendments include a revision of the definition of \"telehealth,\" to provide that the term includes, without limitation, the delivery of services from a provider of health care to a patient at a different location through the use of synchronous and asynchronous store-and-forward interaction.", "The second amendment replaced the term \"standard telephone\" to reference \"audio-only.\"", "The third one is a provision that prohibits health professional licensing boards from prohibiting licensees from establishing a patient-provider relationship via telehealth when it is clinically appropriate to do so and authorizes the State Board of Health of the Department of Health and Human Services to establish regulations prescribing requirements governing a process of establishing a patient-provider relationship via telehealth.", "That new provision can be found in section 8, subsection 4.", "The fourth amendment was an attempt to carve out workers' compensation from this mandate.", "There was no focus in the Commission's deliberations on workers' compensation; instead, it was an inclusion from the drafting decision.", "In a conceptual amendment, Chair Julia Ratti requested to remove provisions related to workers' compensation to comply\u2014to carve them out of the requirement for payment parity.", "That concludes my remarks.", "Chair Nguyen: Are Mr. Ott and Mr. Young available for questions?", "I see them nodding their heads.", "I will go to members' questions.", "Assemblywoman Titus: In section 1, subsection 1, paragraph (a), subparagraph (2), the data dashboard must \"allow for the user .", ".", ".", ".\"", "Who would the user be?", "Sara Cholhagian: The user, in this context, is a member of the public.", "The intent is to have this publicly displayed, and the user would be the public.", "Assemblywoman Titus: Section 1, subsection 2, paragraph (a), subparagraph (1), says that the dashboard shall have relevant information.", "What is considered \"relevant?\"", "Who will determine what \"relevant information\" is?", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 7, 2021 Sara Cholhagian: I will do my best to answer this.", "Kyra Morgan, the Chief Biostatistician in the Division of Public and Behavioral Health in DHHS, will be heading this effort as a part of the Office of Analytics.", "She was not able to join us today.", "If I cannot answer this, I will follow up with you.", "My understanding is that the relevant information would be their interpretation of the requirements outlined in this bill in section 1, subsection 2.", "Assemblywoman Titus: In section 2, subsection 1, paragraph (h), what does it mean \"to make such access more equitable\"?", "Is it access to the dashboard?", "Is it access to telehealth?", "Is it access to health care in general?", "What access needs to be more equitable?", "Sara Cholhagian: Regarding the intent around this request for equitable access, the Commission wanted to make sure they address vulnerable populations that may not have great access to telehealth services.", "When you talk about the reference \"to make such access more equitable,\" it means that if the data shows vulnerable populations or service areas with lower utilization rates, the Department must consider how to make those areas more equitable.", "Assemblywoman Titus: The reason I am asking these questions is, I am not sure where in the bill you decide what is relevant.", "The public goes on as the user.", "You have someone who is the user, but somebody else is collecting the data.", "With that data, is this platform somehow going to make health care more equitable?", "I do not see that pattern.", "My next question is regarding section 4, subsection 1, paragraph (a).", "In your presentation, you mentioned you would not include audio-only.", "In telehealth for mental health, we were looking at more access.", "It has been a real issue.", "You are not recognizing we may need to have the availability of just audio.", "Not everyone has a phone with FaceTime for visual access.", "Not everybody has a computer.", "Sometimes, all they have is access to a landline phone, especially in my rural areas where we frequently do not have access to the Internet.", "I am curious why you would exclude the audio-only component.", "Sara Cholhagian: I will take the first part and reference the provision about users and looking at the data.", "That is aimed more as a public awareness and transparency effort to make sure the user has the ability to look at these policies and to keep policy and its consequences in the public eye.", "When you look at the review part in section 2, subsection 1(h), the key component of that is to review access and make sure, after the Department reviews access, they consider those evaluations in their policymaking decisions.", "The component for the user is to see it is a transparency effort to keep the public involved and aware of those decisions.", "When it comes to audio-only and having a carve-out, you are absolutely right about making sure that there is continued access for the patient to be able to use the telephone, which is why the Commission voted to allow for audio-only to be preserved access as an allowable Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 7, 2021 technology.", "It just did not recognize it as an adequate platform to provide proper health care services like changing the standards.", "I think there was some discussion around whether it warrants the same reimbursement level.", "There was not enough comfort with the commissioners' deliberation to say that they must include audio-only as a part of the reimbursement mechanism, but they definitely wanted it, to contain access and allow it for a recognized modality.", "Assemblywoman Titus: In your opening statement, you talked about having parity with paying the telehealth providers with the brick-and-mortar providers because you wanted to encourage more providers to use telehealth so that, hopefully, you would increase access.", "This is my fourth session.", "At every session and in my career, I have advocated for access to health care.", "I am on board with that.", "I also understand the disparity in health care and those who are not able to seek health care.", "That is frequently out in the rural areas.", "Telehealth makes it helpful.", "I support the telehealth concept and have used it, especially for psychiatric patients.", "My concern is about offering parity in reimbursement for telehealth providers versus brick-and-mortar providers.", "In the contract world of health care, when you negotiate a contract with providers, you set what you are going to reimburse a provider.", "I am concerned about paying the same rate to telehealth providers and the brick-and-mortar person who stayed in a community and has tried to survive under health care regulations.", "The telehealth provider has no investment in the community and does not have to pay employees in the community.", "I am worried that, in the long run, you might do the opposite of what you are trying to do\u2014create access to care\u2014if telehealth becomes the only access to health care because you pushed everybody else out of business.", "I am concerned about the parity of reimbursement piece and how that will shape up for those providers who have dedicated their lives living in a community.", "Sara Cholhagian: I am not sure if there was a question.", "I do not know how to respond to that.", "During the Commission's deliberations, their focus was driven on increased access and providing another alternative delivery model for patients to receive services.", "There was not a deep discussion or deliberation on modifying brick-and-mortar businesses or changing the economics of some of the other smaller providers.", "It was around, How can we provide another option to make sure that increased access is here to stay?", "Assemblywoman Titus: Again, that is per other discussions we have had on a bill we heard just the other day about medical practices aligning and people leaving and signing into big groups.", "Part of this is the global discussion of how we really access care and all these little things that chip away at that.", "I just wanted to bring it to your attention.", "Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: I would like to ask a different question regarding audio-only.", "In the Assembly Committee on Judiciary, we had a bill about the police being able to use a telephone, an iPad, or some type of electronic device to have a person in crisis speak to someone who provided emotional Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 7, 2021 counseling.", "Part of that bill was not just that they talk on an iPad, but that they might be able to hold a phone up to someone and have them get some counseling.", "Would the audio-only exclusion affect that?", "That is a very important portion of the calls made by a Mobile Outreach Safety Team (MOST).", "In my community where we have many providers of homeless care and mental health services, we do not want an inadvertent conflict with those teams not being able to provide that service.", "Would you please respond?", "Sara Cholhagian: I understand and am empathetic to your concern.", "To give you some comfort, the audio-only carve-out is specifically related to the reimbursement provision.", "There is no restriction on the use of that modality to provide service.", "It is only meant for the reimbursement portion on the providers and payers, but not for the utilization of an audio service modality.", "Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: Would you please explain that a bit more?", "You are saying it only applies to the reimbursement portion.", "If the police are contracting with an organization to provide these services and they are being reimbursed by Medicaid\u2014I do not know if they are, but if they were\u2014could this interfere with that?", "Sara Cholhagian: What I meant by \"the reimbursement portion\" is there is no mandated requirement that it must be paid in parity with in-person care.", "This means that it can be billed and reimbursed; it does not mean that it is automatically mandated at the same level as in-person care.", "It would warrant reimbursement at the flexibility of the payer and provider discussion.", "It can still be allowed; it is just not a mandate that it is reimbursed at the same rate as in-person service.", "Perhaps, for more clarity, Deputy Administrator DuAne Young could explain that from the state side so you can see how that reimbursement would work.", "DuAne Young, Deputy Administrator, Division of Health Care Financing and Policy, Department of Health and Human Services: I will give a little bit of history so that we can put this on the legislative record in this house as we did in the Senate.", "When we first went down this path to put this legislation forward, working with the Patient Protection Commission, we determined that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) had not made a ruling if audio-only communications for telehealth would continue outside of the public health emergency as they have been under the public health emergency.", "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has now ruled that if a provider is able to maintain the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and reasonable efforts of privacy, audio-only is included under the definition within the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification, for the purposes of CMS reimbursement for telehealth.", "As it is, Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 422, as outlined within this bill, does not change.", "Medicaid already had reimbursement parity for telehealth and in-person services.", "This provision allows some guardrails for audio-only communication, meaning that, even though the Division has been paying at parity for audio-only communication through the public health emergency, if we were to ever get into an economic crisis or needed to adjust Medicaid's budget, we would not Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 7, 2021 have to pay for parity for telephone-only calls and could adjust the fee schedule and cost-based providers if necessary.", "These are appropriate guardrails.", "Other legislation being considered would expand audio-only.", "For that, the Division has placed a fiscal note because of the increased utilization the Division would see for audio-only, so this is an appropriate guardrail as the language is written now to keep that utilization and allow the Division the levers that it already had in NRS Chapter 422.", "To go back to Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong's question regarding crisis services, audio-only crisis behavioral health services are and have always been allowed through Medicaid policies.", "When a person is in a behavioral health crisis and calls a crisis line to speak with an enrolled professional, the professional can bill Medicaid for the crisis intervention.", "Those services are allowed.", "On these platforms, MOST officers were able, even before the pandemic, to bill for those services and would be able to continue to do so.", "Chair Nguyen: Are there any follow-up questions?", "Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: No.", "I appreciate this history and in-depth explanation because this is very concerning to many of us.", "We hear things in different houses and committees, and then you see there is a nexus.", "I just want to make sure that I am not making a mistake when I push the button.", "Assemblyman Orentlicher: On the parity of reimbursement, I understand the goal of encouraging providers to use telehealth, so that makes sense.", "On the other hand, I can see that the cost of providing telehealth services is lower than on-site services, so we might get into an over-reimbursement setting.", "If it turns out, after a couple of years, people and providers have gotten used to it and are willing, we have solved the access problem, but now we might have transitioned to an over-reimbursement.", "Would we have to come as a Legislature to amend this?", "Is there a way to give some sort of authority to eliminate it or sunset it without having to come back to the Legislature?", "Sara Cholhagian: I would defer to our attorney to answer your legal question.", "I would be hesitant to try to respond to something that is legal and technical in nature.", "Chair Nguyen: Ms. O'Krent, are you on the line and able to respond, or do you need additional time to do some research?", "Karly O'Krent, Committee Counsel: I can answer that question now.", "As the bill is currently drafted, they would have to come back and change those provisions to adjust the reimbursement rates.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 7, 2021 Assemblyman Orentlicher: If there is a way for us to revise this now so we can give some kind of ability to change this without having to change the statute, it would be worth considering.", "Chair Nguyen: Assemblyman Orentlicher, do you have any other follow-up questions?", "Assemblyman Orentlicher: No.", "Assemblywoman Peters: I have questions related to the intention of certain language.", "The first is a clarifying question about the data privacy and security of the dashboard, ensuring it meets with confidentiality standards and all of that.", "I wanted to make sure to get that on the record.", "The other piece is the definition of \"different groups and populations\" as mentioned in section 1, subsection 1, paragraph (a).", "It looks to me as if you outlined some of that in section 1, subsection 1, paragraph (a), subparagraph (2), but I want to make sure we have a clear understanding of what your intention of reviewing the access for different groups and populations means.", "Sara Cholhagian: I will defer to Kyra Morgan for additional follow-up.", "I will answer to the best of my ability.", "Because there are no mandated new data collection requirements in this bill, all the privacy and concerns are already embedded in their current operations and process and would align.", "The data dashboard is intended to be created utilizing existing resources.", "The security would follow what is already in place.", "To answer your question about the different demographics, the Commission wanted to make sure they captured all the right demographics to look at any potential vulnerable population.", "That language was provided by drafting, so the specifics of that and the feedback I received from Commission members were generally in agreement that it captured their intent.", "I have not heard any negative feedback about those parameters.", "Assemblywoman Peters: I would appreciate it if any follow-up information could come to the Committee so we can all see it.", "My next question has to do with the second part of the bill.", "In your definition of \"telehealth\" in section 7, subsection 6, paragraph (d), you use the word \"audio-visual.\"", "Do you mean that telehealth is only reimbursable if it uses both the audio and the visual mechanisms?", "I did a telehealth call and my video was on the wrong side of my computer.", "I was watching the screen and did not have the video on me.", "In that case, I did not have audio-visual interaction.", "Do you mean the best attempt at that?", "I just want to make sure we are not accidentally excluding certain practices or incidental actions\u2014if someone is blind and cannot see the video, if someone is deaf and needs to use the texting mechanism of Zoom, those kinds of things.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 7, 2021 Sara Cholhagian: I will ask Deputy Administrator Young to opine on this part.", "I can tell you that the intent of the definition was to be all-inclusive of all the appropriate modalities.", "There was not an attempt to exclude any one technology, but I will defer to him to explain that in a more practical way than I can address.", "DuAne Young: The intent and the language in NRS Chapter 422 originally focused on the audio-visual impact of telehealth.", "As I mentioned earlier, audio-only was allowed only in instances of a behavioral health crisis or case management, not through other means.", "Since then, during the public health emergency, audio-only has been allowed.", "This language was crafted as a response to fix state law but not supersede federal law.", "The regulation through the Office for Civil Rights within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has been reversed and CMS has reversed course, so audio-only is allowable.", "This language only speaks to the reimbursement portion, but it does encapsulate existing language, the framework of NRS Chapter 422, and the new provision for audio-only as allowable by the federal government.", "Assemblywoman Peters: This question has to do with section 8, establishing regulations that allow a doctor and patient relationship via telehealth.", "Are there existing models of this in other states, or are we creating something from scratch with those regulations?", "Sara Cholhagian: I do not believe Nevada is creating anything new.", "The addition of the proposed amendment was provided through discussions with the American Telemedicine Association and Teladoc Health.", "I would like to get back to you to make sure I answer correctly.", "I believe this was model language provided through the American Telemedicine Association for Nevada to consider.", "Assemblywoman Peters: I was thinking about the time it takes to adopt regulations and if the drafting came up with brand-new language that was never used before.", "I wondered about the timeline for that, but it sounds like we may have something to start with while getting into that regulatory process.", "Assemblyman Matthews: I have a question on broadband access, as there is limited broadband in some cases.", "Will we be looking at the limits on broadband for our urban and rural areas since this might be a deterrent to access to telehealth in some cases?", "To what extent might you try to address that?", "Sara Cholhagian: That was a part of the deliberations of the Commission when they started discussing equitable access, asking what they could do to improve broadband access to vulnerable populations.", "Being mindful of the economic climate at the time, they did not want to put forth a measure that created an unfunded mandate to increase broadband

certain vulnerable populations that could benefit from increased broadband access and resources dedicated to those areas.", "Assemblyman Matthews: To make sure I understand, it is part of the data collection.", "You anticipate that will include data on the need for providers and access to make sure we can provide these services in some instances.", "Do I understand you correctly?", "Will part of the data collection address that?", "Sara Cholhagian: Yes, but not necessarily data collection; it would be more data analysis.", "They are going to use data they already have and are already collecting in the state, but they will analyze access points and identify vulnerable populations.", "I think in discussions of potential solutions for further policies the thought about increased broadband to enhance equitable access would be a part of the deliberations.", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: I appreciate the ability to make sure we do this right.", "In section 4, subsection 1, it states, \"The Director shall.", ".", ".", ".\"", "We are talking about the State Plan of Medicaid, so this is just for Medicaid.", "Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 442 is about child and maternal health.", "Will we see this language specific to section 4, subsection 1, paragraph (b), subparagraph (5), on categorizing the service provider through telehealth differently for purposes relating to coverage or reimbursement?", "Is that going to be specific to maternal and child health programs through Medicaid?", "It is a short bill.", "If we were touching every section of health care, it would be bigger.", "Is it only living in that one spot, or is it more comprehensive than that?", "Sara Cholhagian: The provision you are referencing is the drafting intent to make sure they capture that telehealth is not treated any differently than in-person care.", "It lives in that provision under child and maternal health, but it is not specific to just child and maternal health.", "Perhaps Ms. O'Krent could opine on that because I see it as a part of the drafting effort to make sure that telehealth services are not treated any differently than in-person care.", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: I scrolled down further, and I see it also in section 7 and NRS Chapter 616C, where we start getting into the insurance policies.", "That is where it is applied across all insurers of health care.", "Is that correct?", "Sara Cholhagian: That provision relates to workers' compensation, and it does not apply to workers' compensation provisions.", "You will see there is a separate definition of \"telehealth\" in section 7 of the bill.", "The intent for that section is to make sure that provisions requiring workers' compensation to comply with the billed audio-only and payment requirements are Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 7, 2021 not applicable to the workers' compensation program, but that provision is applicable to every other insurance carrier in the remaining sections 8 through 16.", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: I want to make sure I have my status quo right.", "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services currently has temporary regulations out through the end of the pandemic that allow for Medicare and Medicaid payment.", "I think the one for Medicare is the 1135 waiver.", "That is the one that is living right now and is going to carry us through the end of the federal government's formal emergency declaration.", "Through that time, Medicare and Medicaid must have parity and allow for the telehealth services.", "Is that right?", "I was trying to figure out when I was reading the 1135 waiver, is it just billing parity?", "Sara Cholhagian: I am going to go back to what Deputy Administrator DuAne Young said about Medicaid.", "In 2015, Medicaid payment parity was codified into law.", "They already pay in parity.", "What the federal waiver did through the public health emergency was allowed reimbursement on the audio-only portion of it.", "Should that end, then the state would go back to the parity already in place.", "There is no modification to state Medicaid.", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: I am trying to figure out what the change is.", "We brought the bill to create a change.", "I see interested groups bringing amendments to this change.", "Obviously, there is a big shift.", "There is enough interest in this that it is a big shift.", "The other piece I was trying to figure out is that with the waiver, CMS was not going to audit for the clinician-patient relationship that had been established prior to using telehealth.", "We are going to say that we will allow the clinician-patient relationship to be established by regulations, and we are going to tell boards not to have a dozen different standards for a dozen different boards.", "Is that the bigger change here?", "I am trying to figure out why we have these big national groups submitting amendments to Nevada legislation.", "It would not matter if we were not changing it substantially, so I am trying to make sure what health care is going to look like in my state a year from now.", "Sara Cholhagian: There are two parts to that.", "First, we are going to go back to one of the larger provisions of this bill relating to reimbursement that compels private payers to reimburse on the same level as they provide for in-person services.", "Parity laws were established in 2015, but the reimbursement portion only applied to state Medicaid.", "This bill compels private payers to reimburse on the same basis as providing health care services in person.", "That is the bigger change for the private payers.", "There is not a modification for the state because they already pay in parity.", "Second, the modification related to the health professionals' licensing boards got national attention and was about making sure that you protect access to care so the patient-provider relationship could still be, if clinically appropriate, allowed to be established via telehealth.", "It happens in practice; that provision makes sure there is nothing in law that could prevent it Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 7, 2021 from happening.", "That maintains alternative access for patients through telehealth services and is about being able to establish that relationship.", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: In my initial quick read, I had it backwards.", "When I said I wanted to figure out the status quo on parity between brick-and-mortar versus telehealth, I was thinking it was pieces of Medicaid, but not all of Medicaid.", "That is where we saw the references to the statute on child and maternal health.", "I also see statutes on private insurance, so it is the reverse of what I thought.", "Medicaid is doing it, but private insurance plans are not required to do it.", "That is a significant change.", "Assemblywoman Titus and I were both in the building when we had the initial hearings on whether we would do telehealth.", "Some thought the sky would fall if we did telehealth or that we would have horrible care.", "Ultimately, it was a way to go.", "For areas of our state, telehealth made sense.", "The conversation was always about telehealth as a supplement; the gold standard of care is to get in through the door and see a physician.", "If that cannot happen or where that cannot happen, then you have telehealth.", "That is the way it has been conceptualized in statute.", "From my perspective, if we are going to mandate all insurers with the parity piece combined with talking about a patient-client relationship, we are drastically changing how health care will look in this state.", "I wanted to make sure I understood.", "The data collection is great and fine, but I worry about those two pieces coming together at once, and I worry about how that will impact our health care market.", "To Assemblywoman Titus' point, we were talking about having worked in health care.", "Ten years ago, I worked for a tiny hospital where there were still nuns providing health care.", "Then the nuns got kicked out.", "Then it got sold.", "Then it was owned by a western-market conglomerate.", "Then a year and a half later, it was sold and went to a western United States corporation, and now it is a national corporation.", "I have seen that acquisition of health care.", "I have lived that acquisition of health care where every year and a half they say, We will keep the name the same so people in the community recognize the name and think we are the same, but the ownership is constantly changing.", "It is always going broader and up, it is not devolving.", "I wonder what this will look like for telehealth when we say health care can be provided by an investor group that is managing a telehealth corporation.", "That is my thought.", "Sara Cholhagian: I appreciate your perspective and understanding of the future.", "You do have a correct understanding of this piece of legislation.", "This is their attempt for a long-term recovery of the new normal and making sure the goal was patient access to care and having virtual alternatives to increase that access.", "You do have a correct understanding of the intent of this legislation.", "Chair Nguyen: Do you have any other follow-up questions?", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 7, 2021 Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: No.", "I appreciate that and the ability to make sure I was thinking about it correctly.", "Chair Nguyen: I was going to go to Assemblywoman Krasner, but Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong has a follow-up question related to what Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson asked.", "Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: This is a good segue to ask on the record the question you and I discussed previously.", "If we have a provider who is only providing telehealth and does not have a brick-and-mortar location in Nevada, and a patient who does not want health care through telehealth is referred to him, now where are we?", "We are placing a patient in a situation of not being in control of how their health care is delivered.", "That needs to be considered.", "I would like you to speak to that because it really concerns me.", "What if that person wants health care in person, and the doctor tells them, I do not do that, or, You will have to wait because my new normal mode is telehealth?", "What happens to that patient?", "How will it increase access if they may not have an option?", "Sara Cholhagian: I appreciate your perspective and understand your concerns.", "This piece of legislation is aimed at providing access to care and giving patients alternative methods of delivery.", "For your scenario in which there may be a mandate from the provider to a patient that says they only are available via telehealth or in person, that is a valid concern.", "However, this piece of legislation does not address any of those mandates.", "It just provides another option.", "It maintains patients' ability to have an alternative method of accessing care.", "Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: I understand that is your intent, but we know that when we do not have clearly defined parameters, people will use their own judgment.", "We could very well see that the patient loses control and that the doctors or whomever they work for do the compelling about how service is delivered based upon profit and not based upon the best use and the best situation for their patients.", "As legislators, we are not in a position to allow people's good nature to drive what they do because we all know that is not what happens in reality.", "Oftentimes, it is corporate governance and profits that do.", "Assemblywoman Krasner: I have a few questions.", "The bill expands telehealth from audio-visual and emergency audio to now include audio-only, but the bill will not allow Medicaid to pay in parity for audio-only interactions with health care providers if there is not enough money to do so.", "Is that correct?", "Sara Cholhagian: That is not correct.", "There is not an expansion of services or an expansion of a different modality.", "I think your question relates to the reimbursement from the state on the audio-only.", "Deputy Administrator DuAne Young explained it and would be better equipped to Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 7, 2021 answer your concern.", "I think your question is related to the reimbursement of audio-only from the state perspective.", "Assemblywoman Krasner: Yes, it is.", "DuAne Young: I want to clarify in plain language: The existing parity for telehealth in NRS Chapter 422 was established in 2015 by the Legislature [Assembly Bill 292 of the 78th Session].", "There was one provision of NRS Chapter 422 in that legislation that prohibited audio-only because there was a federal Medicaid provision through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights that did not allow audio-only or HIPAA-compliant platforms.", "During the public health emergency, the Trump Administration lifted that ban on audio-only as a promotion.", "Then CMS came back and said we did not have the authority to do that because we did not get permission from the Office for Civil Rights to do so.", "Under the Biden Administration, the Office for Civil Rights did not change the regulation; however, they formally changed the interpretation behind that regulation that said audio-only is included for telehealth as long as the provider can maintain reasonable privacy standards.", "That reversed the CMS's course to say it is allowable for reimbursement from the federal government for Medicaid services.", "The language in this chapter removes that state provision so that it is allowable beyond the public health emergency.", "It also establishes through that one clause that Medicaid could and still does pay parity for audio-only communications, so it does not tie our hands.", "To speak to Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong's point about quality of care, we at Medicaid know that while we do our due diligence to gatekeep those providers, there are providers who would set up shop and not effectively provide care.", "We would be chasing those providers to make sure they uphold the standard of quality of care and are stewards of the state's and the federal government's resources.", "Not changing the existing language and allowing for a nonpayment parity allows us appropriate guardrails so we would not have to put a fiscal note on this.", "We would be able to control utilization, and it would allow us to say a provider must meet those standards of care and ensure they are serving the patients of Nevada as they are claiming to do.", "Assemblywoman Krasner: Back to my question: If a health care provider provides the initial consultation with the patient through audio-only and through telehealth, and if Medicaid is not going to have to pay parity if there is not money to do so for audio-only, why would a health care provider even do this?", "Why would you expect a health care provider to do this knowing they might not get paid for their services?", "DuAne Young: There would be payment.", "It may not be the same level of payment as if they were providing traditional telehealth.", "In establishing the policy based on the Legislature's decision in 2015, Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 7, 2021 we knew there were some infrastructure costs in telehealth, so I believe that is the reason the Department of Health and Human Services and Medicaid services supported the provision without an extended fiscal note.", "We knew there were some infrastructure into traditional telehealth equipment.", "We have providers who utilize audio-only.", "We have been paying them at parity through the public health emergency, but there are some providers that receive a Prospective Payment System (PPS) encounter rate.", "We have been paying them at parity through the public health emergency, but there are some providers who receive PPS encounter rates that are based on their costs.", "There are other providers who receive rates that are based solely on their costs.", "We know that audio-only has a lesser cost than traditional telehealth equipment or the infrastructure of full brick-and-mortar, so if those costs were to reduce, this would give us the flexibility to make adjustments based on their reduced costs.", "It is not to discourage providers from doing audio-only, but it does allow the provider to decide if the reimbursement is lowered at some point.", "They could make that business decision if it is advantageous for them.", "It also gives the state the leverage it needs within Medicaid policy to control the guardrails appropriately so we do not have to come back before the body of the Legislature to say we reached a shortfall; we can control the mechanisms within policy to have those appropriate fiscal and policy guardrails.", "Assemblywoman Krasner: I respectfully disagree with you.", "Furthermore, does a health care provider who provides services to somebody via telehealth get sued for any less amount for medical malpractice?", "Or are they also going to get sued for malpractice and then not be reimbursed by Medicaid in parity with this bill?", "DuAne Young: I am not equipped to answer a medical malpractice question.", "I do not practice law.", "I will defer to either Mr. Ott or Ms. O'Krent.", "Gregory D. Ott, Chief Deputy Attorney General, Patient Protection Commission, Office of the Governor: I would prefer you go to Ms. O'Krent.", "Chair Nguyen: Ms. O'Krent, are you able to answer the question, or will you need to follow up with Assemblywoman Krasner?", "Karly O'Krent: I will need to follow up and am happy to do that.", "I will send any information necessary to the Committee.", "Chair Nguyen: Assemblywoman Krasner, Ms. O'Krent will follow up with you.", "Do you have any further questions?", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 7, 2021 Assemblywoman Krasner: No.", "I think this is bad policy.", "I do not think we would expect any other profession to not be paid in parity for doing their services in an alternate fashion when there is a need for such in that state, and we have already established there is a desperate need in this state.", "Chair Nguyen: This is a very important discussion we are having.", "I am looking to see if there are additional questions.", "Some

certain purposes.", "The State Treasurer may select one or more fiduciary organizations to administer the money in the program.", "To establish an account, an eligible person and the fiduciary organization must enter into an agreement in which the account holder deposits funds into a financial institution and the fiduciary organization matches the funds with not more than $5 for each $1

and Human Services May 24, 2021 Assembly Bill 85 of the 80th Session, modernizing and clarifying the mental health crisis hold process [page 2, Exhibit C].", "In that process, we had a deeper understanding of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 433A, and Senate Bill 70 (2nd Reprint) is a continuation of that work.", "Part of the product of A.B.", "85 of the 80th Session was that we developed this brochure [page 4] that we sent out to all the hospitals\u201410,000 copies in the last year.", "I hope that type of work will continue with S.B.", "70 (R2) if it were to pass.", "I want to start with a brief overview of mental health crisis holds [page 5].", "All 50 states in the U.S. have involuntary mental health hold laws to protect people and communities from risk of harm to self or others or inability to care for self due to mental illness.", "It is the greatest loss of individual rights in society other than arrest and is based upon the constitutional ability of police intervention for harm to self or others.", "Nevada's mental health crisis hold lasts for 72 hours, which is common among the states.", "It includes the process of detention and application for emergency admission, medical evaluation, and certification that the individual is indeed in a mental health crisis.", "At any time after medical evaluation and certification, that individual may be admitted into an inpatient psychiatric facility under emergency admission.", "If the crisis lasts longer than 72 hours, the petitioner needs to petition the court for an involuntary court-ordered admission into an inpatient psychiatric facility for treatment for up to six months [page 6].", "I want to also note that, since 2014, Nevada has also had an involuntary outpatient treatment mechanism in the law as well that is known as assisted outpatient treatment and also lasts up to six months.", "This is a quick overview of what I just discussed showing the steps of the mental health crisis hold [page 7].", "These are the changes we made in S.B.", "70 (R2) [page 8].", "We tackled many pieces of the mental health crisis hold process.", "You will see that we updated the terms, definitions, and criteria for the mental health crisis hold process.", "We updated the chemical restraint definition and the family petition process.", "We clarified and defined the emergency admission, updated the involuntary court-ordered admission into inpatient psychiatric hospitals, updated conditional release, updated assisted outpatient treatment, and created a clearer process.", "I want to note that many of these concepts are not likeable, per se, but they are necessary.", "Sometimes we have legislators who have wanted to vote against these, but by voting against this, you are voting against clarifying the law.", "The effort of S.B.", "70 (R2) is not to create any new mechanisms, just to clarify and update those mechanisms so we have a more transparent process that patients, families, and providers can understand.", "We are trying to get everyone on the same page; so we really see this as upholding patient rights.", "In the process of developing S.B.", "70 (R2), we had very diverse stakeholder involvement.", "I facilitated a statewide mental health crisis hold work group at the request of the Northern Regional Behavioral Health Policy Board since 2017.", "We have had very strong participation from Clark County's Judge Yeager, Washoe County's Judge Lu, the public defenders, the Division of Public and Behavioral Health within the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), the Nevada Hospital Association, et cetera.", "You can read the list yourselves [page 9].", "On the youth side, we had a lot of participation from the Department of Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 24, 2021 Education; the Clark County School District; Clark County, Washoe County, and rural child welfare agencies; the Division of Child and Family Services, Department of Health and Human Services; and children and family advocates from Nevada PEP Statewide Family Network.", "At 70 pages, the bill is huge.", "It is complex, but it can be broken down into five elements [page 10, Exhibit C].", "It updates and modernizes the mental health crisis hold law, and it updates assisted outpatient treatment and conditional release.", "We did not recreate the youth mental health crisis hold process that was created in the 2019 Session; we adjusted some pieces so it is workable and aligned with parental rights.", "We updated the chemical restraint definition as well, and I will walk you through each one of these processes.", "The first element involves updating the mental health crisis hold process and defining terms [page 11].", "As I said, A.B.", "85 of the 80th Session made a few changes, but as we got into NRS Chapter 433A, we realized that it was written in 1975.", "Because there have not been any changes since then, it reads as though it is from 1975.", "Right now, it reads that a law enforcement officer detains an individual and applies for emergency admission into an inpatient psychiatric facility.", "It is a one-step process where they detain and take the individual into an inpatient psychiatric facility for evaluation.", "That is not our current system.", "Our current system is now detainment and you are brought to either a mental health crisis center or to a hospital emergency room (ER) where you are evaluated and observed.", "A large percentage of people are taken off that hold because they are found to be stable or to not meet the criteria.", "That step was missing in our statute, and we tried to break apart that first mental health crisis hold and the emergency admission to modernize the law.", "Our proposed solutions are in sections 28 to 32, updating the mental health crisis hold process to align with current practice and clearly separating the mental health crisis hold from emergency admission.", "In sections 3 through 8, we developed definitions for the terms that were used in the law so everyone can be on the same page.", "In section 26, because we adjusted the \"application for emergency admission,\" we are now using a more neutral term\u2014\"mental health crisis hold.\"", "Before, the Attorney General would approve forms for the admission of people to inpatient psych; and now, they will approve the forms for detainment, evaluation, treatment, and conditional release, so that expands the added terms we developed.", "We clarified the family petition for court-ordered pickup [page 12].", "The problem was that the process in law was unworkable and vague, so we updated it.", "Section 9 develops the petition process for court-ordered pickup and evaluation of individuals suspected to meet criteria for mental health crisis.", "Section 36 removes the ability for a spouse, parent, adult children, or legal guardian to petition for straight admission to an inpatient psychiatric facility.", "Because we are always trying to think, it is nice to have screens and filters for people to go into inpatient psychiatric facilities.", "With the current process, it makes sense for them to go to a hospital ER.", "If they are deemed appropriate, and based on their insurance, they can go into an inpatient psychiatric facility.", "This one-step process straight into the inpatient psychiatric facility is reminiscent of the 1970s and no longer necessary.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 24, 2021 We clarified the hospital and court procedure for individuals who cannot be medically cleared in 72 hours [page 13, Exhibit C].", "That process was really unworkable in the law, and we made it so that it is clear.", "Hospitals did not have a place to turn to in the law to understand what process to take when those individuals are not medically cleared within that time, so we corrected that.", "We also updated hospital times for notifying guardians and courts [page 14].", "Currently in law, hospitals are required to provide a notice of discharge to courts and guardians for patients who are under involuntary court-ordered admission ten days prior to discharge.", "That is actually a longer length of stay than the average length of stay for people in inpatient psychiatric units, which is now about seven days.", "We brought those times down to three days prior to discharge.", "We also allow for flexibility for hospitals because there are people who only stay for one day sometimes.", "We tried to create more reasonable guidelines for that notification, because it is an essential part of the discharge process.", "Sections 39, 47, 48, and 48.5 made those changes.", "We clarified the involuntary court-ordered and county transfer process [page 15].", "Patients were getting lost in the system if they were transferred between counties, and there was no standard timeline that existed to ensure detention does not extend beyond the legal limits.", "Section 39 requires a person who submits such a petition to notify a court if the subject of the petition is currently admitted to a mental health facility or hospital and has been transferred to another facility.", "That helps courts who have ordered people in to keep track of where these people go.", "Section 41.5 clarifies the court transfer process when examining personnel are not available and the county of residence is responsible.", "Again, there are times when, say, Esmeralda County does not have the resources to be able to do this court-ordered admission.", "By law, they are able to transfer that to another county and it was vague in the law.", "We have been able to clarify it so the courts can be on the same page with that.", "Then there is direct filing in the county of treatment which allows a mechanism for the petitioner, for instance a rural hospital\u2014knowing that the person is going to West Hills Behavioral Health Hospital in Washoe County\u2014can petition Washoe County to do the court-ordered admission.", "That way, Washoe County can have oversight of that patient while that person is in the Washoe County system.", "That creates a more streamlined process and also conforms to current practice.", "Continuing this update of the involuntary court-ordered and county transfer process, one problem was that courts throughout the state order patients into state services without the necessary evaluation and acceptance process [page 16].", "This happens a lot with Northern Nevada Adult Mental Health Services and Southern Nevada Adult Mental Health Services.", "There needed to be an actual acceptance process from the hospital following admission guidelines, so we clarified that once a person is involuntarily admitted to a mental health facility, the admitting court can transfer the case, and the mental health facility is required to notify the court if the person is transferred.", "Actually, that is already in law.", "Once you do one court-ordered admission, that is it.", "You have that court-ordered admission.", "Currently what is happening is some rural courts will do the court-ordered admission and then try to transfer the case to the urban areas.", "You can see it is messy because there is not much clarity in the law.", "Section 50 of this bill prohibits the transfer of a consumer who has been admitted to a mental health facility or required to receive assisted outpatient treatment to another facility Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 24, 2021 or provider of treatment unless arrangements are made regarding the cost of treatment.", "Again, we need to be on the same page when there are transfers and work according to the system we have regarding insurance and such.", "Section 48 abolishes the requirement that an evaluation team evaluate a person who is under a court-ordered admission in a mental health facility or required to receive assisted outpatient treatment before the person can be unconditionally released before the expiration of the order [page 17, Exhibit C].", "Right now that does not happen, and all the stakeholders thought that was an unnecessary step.", "Section 23.5 updates the term \"person professionally qualified in the field of psychiatric mental health\" so the term is used for both public and private.", "This allows us to have a shorthand term for that type of person as opposed to continuing to list all the people who would be able to fit under that term.", "In section 3.5, we applied the term \"consumer\" to the entirety of NRS Chapter 433A so we can be on the same page with definitions.", "Then we closed a loophole.", "Prior to S.B.", "70 (R2), what is in current law mandates courts to seal records in cases of court-ordered admission but not for all these other people who are in the system and still going to court.", "Therefore, there would be a person who could go to court, have their case heard, the court would deny it, and there was no mandate that the court would seal that record.", "There were other cases like that, so we wanted to make sure there was standardized privacy across the board.", "For assisted outpatient treatment (AOT), the court-ordered outpatient treatment, these programs were written into law in 2014 and they were specific programs funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the federal funding arm for mental health [page 18].", "They were unique programs with one in Clark County and one in Washoe County.", "We had a technical assistance provider come and tell us that it is actually a generic mechanism of treatment across the board and that these are not specialized programs.", "We worked to develop a law that allows for that generic use in all counties and not just in Washoe and Clark Counties.", "We also had an interesting part of Nevada law.", "It was the only state that first required that the patient meet criteria for inpatient hospitalization and then meet AOT criteria.", "Basically, the courts needed to find that someone was a danger to self or others before ordering them into outpatient treatment in the community.", "We made some improvements in this with the criteria so people are able to see the specific criteria in the population that this court-ordered treatment would fit.", "The proposed solutions are in sections 11 through 21, 20.5, 24, and 43, which develop specific assisted outpatient treatment criteria and program procedures and clarify and update current law for implementation in all counties.", "It creates a separate AOT process so that the AOT process is interwoven into the inpatient process and now it is very easy to read and understand.", "You will see that there is this requirement that the same counsel must continue to represent the person, so section 42 moves that piece into the AOT section so it is all one cohesive format.", "As I was saying, we created a generic term, and we think this creates a clear and transparent process so individuals will know what AOT is and how to petition for the program [page 19].", "It enables community providers to provide AOT services in coordination with courts.", "In my region we have certified community behavioral health clinics (CCBHCs).", "Those agencies Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 24, 2021 are able to provide the services of AOT, so it is possible for us to expand assisted outpatient treatment, at least in my region, into other regions that have CCBHCs without needing state funding.", "As I was saying, it clearly identifies the target population instead of just saying the person is a danger to self or others; for instance, if the person is over the age of 18, has a mental illness, and has a history of poor compliance.", "There are even basic outcomes the person needs to meet; for example, been hospitalized, receiving services in a behavioral health unit, in a detention facility for 48 months, et cetera.", "The last one is that the person must be capable of surviving in the community in which he or she resides without substantial likelihood of serious harm to himself or herself or others if he or she receives AOT.", "Conditional release is another mechanism that provides a level of care in the community that we are working toward [page 20, Exhibit C].", "These are individuals in inpatient psychiatric units.", "I used to work in one as a discharge planner.", "You get them stabilized so they are no longer a danger to self or others and they are under a court-ordered admission, but you know that without necessary supports, they are going to deteriorate when they leave.", "In those situations, it is hard to discharge because it is essentially an unsafe discharge.", "Many hospitals may decide to keep that person until the end of the court-ordered admission and if they still have not found a great solution, the person is discharged without good support and deteriorates\u2014as we suspected would happen.", "What this mechanism creates is a discharge plan on steroids where the hospital, if the individual is still under inpatient court-ordered involuntary admission, can try the individual out by coordinating with a team in the community and having the individual agree to certain terms.", "They may tell the person, you are going to go to treatment, a community team is going to check in with you, and we are really going to try to create a warm handoff into the community.", "The hospital can provide that information to the court, and this is really important in a place like Clark County because they have 20 hospitals.", "You have people constantly going all through those hospitals and they are re-creating the wheel with every discharge plan, every treatment plan.", "The court can serve as a central entity and be able to coordinate that care so if that individual comes back in, the court can say, \"This is what the last treatment team said worked; here are the medications,\" and be able to provide that to the next hospital for continuity of care.", "If the individual looks as though they are starting to deteriorate, the community organization working with the individual can come to the court and at least inform them of the deterioration that is happening.", "We are really trying to create another supported level of care in the communities.", "Sections 22, 39, and 47 clarify and update the conditional release process.", "This was already in the law.", "It was completely unworkable.", "We think that having more court oversight will provide more due process for individuals.", "Looking at the youth mental health crisis hold, as I was saying, they were using inaccurate terms when the law was written [page 21].", "The way the law was written also was saying that hospitals have to notify the parents of the youth being detained on a hold 24 hours after that emergency admission.", "It is hoped that the youth would never be admitted to an inpatient psychiatric facility without parental consent or knowledge or without some other due process.", "We thought what it is really trying to say is that hospitals have to notify the parents Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 24, 2021 within 24 hours of the placement of the hold, so we made small changes like that.", "Section 33 clarifies and changes the time hospitals detaining a youth must notify a parent or legal guardian of holding a youth under a mental health crisis hold from 24 hours to 8 hours.", "That was a big request from the family advocates, and we thought that was reasonable from the hospital's perspective.", "As a hospital, that is the first thing you should be doing if a youth is coming in without a parent.", "Section 35 also creates a mechanism for youth to be released from a mental health crisis hold to parent custody if the guardian or parent agrees to treatment or accepts physical custody of the youth.", "Right now, there is no place on the form for that, so we wanted to create that option and mechanism.", "This next slide [page 22, Exhibit C] is titled \"chemical restraint,\" and everyone is probably concerned about it.", "Nevada's chemical restraint mechanism was developed in 1975, is outdated, and does not take into account innovations, new medications, and new uses of medications in health care approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).", "The solution was in sections 2, 65, 66, and 68, where the term \"chemical restraint\" is used, and excludes modern FDA-approved interventions for treatment from the definition of \"chemical restraint.\"", "This was proposed by the Division of Public and Behavioral Health, DHHS, whose staff worked closely with the chair of the Commission on Behavioral Health, also within DHHS.", "That was the last slide, and I am happy to accept questions.", "Chair Nguyen: Assemblywoman Titus, who sits on the Northern Regional Behavioral Health Policy Board, also has a presentation in support of S.B.", "70 (R2).", "Assemblywoman Robin L. Titus, Assembly District No.", "38: I have been seated on this board now for two sessions, and I know Ms.", "Flood gave you an overview of what the board does.", "There are now five boards that all have representatives from the Legislature sitting on them.", "Those of you on this Committee know we have been working for many sessions on what we know as the original \"Legal 2000\" hold, trying to fix this statute.", "The ultimate goal was to make sure that a person's rights were upheld, that the person got medical and mental attention in an expeditious manner and was able to get treatment.", "During these many sessions we tried to identify where the hiccups were on this, and over the years we heard testimony concerning people being stuck in emergency rooms because they needed a medical clearance or medication or a place where they could be sent.", "I want to give credit to Ms.", "Flood.", "What she did was engage every single aspect of this large bill and not just from the medical aspect, which is what we would get hung up on, but also the judicial aspect\u2014whether it was in the rurals or in the urban areas, whether it was a little hospital or a big hospital.", "The key was trying to look at what the needs were throughout the state and making sure patients in mental health crises were treated both from a medical aspect and, at the same time, making sure their legal rights were upheld.", "Again, thank you for hearing this bill.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 24, 2021 Chair Nguyen: Thank you, Assemblywoman Titus, and thank you, Ms.", "Flood.", "I know in talking with many of the stakeholders that you spoke with that you often met weekly, if not twice a week, throughout the entire pandemic to make sure you were incorporating all the stakeholders.", "Do we have any questions from Committee members?", "Assemblywoman Thomas: Thank you to Assemblywoman Titus and Ms.", "Flood.", "Are hospitals equipped to handle the mentally ill or people who they suspect are mentally ill?", "I know in the south there are several private mental health facilities that can assist because that is what they do.", "However, the hospitals do not seem to be zeroing in on just that subject.", "Assemblywoman Titus: I would say that the hospitals absolutely were not, which is what was critical to another piece of legislation.", "We passed a bill involving crisis stabilization centers which were critical to looking at the overall mental health of our state.", "One thing we identified is that we do not have adequate mental health care throughout our state.", "The little hospital where I practiced is an eight-bed hospital.", "We did not have a mental health area where we could stabilize patients who were in mental health crises.", "That was a component we are addressing throughout the state, and we are getting better at it, but this bill addresses that.", "This bill says what do I do in the ER in my rural area, how long were patients sitting in a big urban emergency room with no access to adequate mental health within that ER because neither my little hospital nor that ER were mental health centers.", "So, partly, we are trying to address that with this legislation and other bills we have seen here.", "Jessica Flood: As Assemblywoman Titus said, we are trying to develop that alternate behavioral health crisis response system.", "That 988 legislation [National Suicide Prevention Lifeline], the crisis stabilization unit\u2014it is pretty amazing watching that be built.", "We have acknowledged that hospitals largely cannot respond to mental illness, so creating those crisis stabilization centers and the crisis call line are essential to being able to adequately respond to people who are in mental health crises.", "Assemblywoman Thomas: If I am understanding this, once that person is admitted to the ER and they know this person is basically unstable, are they transferred to another facility that actually can get them the help they really need without a court order?", "Assemblywoman Titus: When we start a mental health hold, there has to be a medical screening before they get admitted to the medical facility.", "That is where our ER would come in.", "The person would be brought to me, I would evaluate them and make sure their mental health crisis is not due to a medical reason like low blood sugar, stopping their medications, or some other medical reason.", "Once we have cleared them medically, we cannot release them until we have an accepting facility.", "That warm handoff, as Ms.", "Flood mentioned, is a critical component, as is Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 24, 2021 having access to a bed.", "For example, there have been times when they would stay in our ER for days until we could get them into a facility.", "Jessica Flood: I would like to add that a court order is not always necessary.", "Sometimes people can be on a hold, and if they voluntarily want to go into a facility, that hold can be discontinued; or if the crisis ends, the hold can be discontinued.", "People are going to hospital ERs, but the goal is for them to go to holds in these crisis stabilization units.", "In my region, we have the Mallory Behavioral Health Crisis Center that works as a psychiatric ER.", "Assemblywoman Thomas: When you mentioned a conditional release, I was trying to understand how the courts are in the role of assessing whether the person is deemed to be released.", "A doctor can determine whether this person is able to be released yet the courts have to give permission.", "Is that what you meant during your presentation?", "Jessica Flood: The courts do not give approval for a discharge; the hospitals decide the discharge.", "The courts are only notified that the conditional release has occurred.", "The courts get the form that the hospitals have done with the community provider so they can be a central repository of coordination, but there is no approval from the courts.", "Assemblywoman Krasner: Thank you for the presentation.", "I appreciate the intent of the bill, but I have questions.", "The first one is about an involuntary health crisis hold.", "The word \"involuntary\" scares me.", "Here in the United States we value our individual rights and liberties, our freedom of movement under the Constitution, so \"involuntary hold\" should give all of us pause.", "I understand there are people who really are going through mental health crises who do need this, but as legislators, we have to be thoughtful and think about odd cases\u2014a worst-case scenario.", "What if somebody is taken against their will in this involuntary mental health crisis hold for 72 hours and really does not belong there?", "My first question is, at every point along the way during the 72-hour extended hold\u2014if somebody decides they are going to go for an extended hold\u2014does that individual have the right to petition the court for release or at least a hearing?", "Jessica Flood: Yes, they do.", "In NRS Chapter 433A we have habeas corpus where the individual can petition the court at any time.", "Actually, that was why we started this work in the first place.", "The law is not well understood, so patients were not able to understand what their rights were.", "Prior to A.B.", "85 of the 80th Session, the hold started at a very ambiguous time after medical clearance.", "You could be held against your will for, let us say 8 hours, and you would ask, When does my 72 hours end?", "They would say that it had not even started until after medical clearance.", "That was pre-2019, and we clarified all that so we could create education.", "That pamphlet I showed you [page 4, Exhibit C] talks about your right to go to the court at any time and have a hearing on that.", "There is also the Nevada Disability Advocacy and Law Center that is able to advocate for individuals with mental illness in those Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 24, 2021 situations as well as the American Civil Liberties Union.", "Those are definitely why those pieces are in place, and there is due process for anyone who requests it.", "Assemblywoman Krasner: Thank you.", "Is the adult or child given notice that they are entitled to a phone call within three hours?", "In NRS 171.153, a person who is

phone call\u2014within three hours.", "In your bill I do not see that, and I think that should be added.", "I wonder what your thoughts are about allowing somebody to be notified that they can make a phone call, whether it is an adult or a minor, within three hours of the time they are taken against their will.", "Do you have thoughts on that, please?", "Jessica Flood: In NRS Chapter 433A, the patient does have the right to access the telephone\u2014not even just within three hours, but during their entire stay at a hospital.", "When we created that brochure, it has all these rights listed.", "I would be open to your thoughts if we need to add the three hours, but having blanket access to a telephone through the entire stay is really important.", "Assemblywoman Krasner: Also in your presentation, did you state that your recent addition is that a minor, a person under age 18 who is taken involuntarily, it is no longer going to be within 24 hours that the parent or guardian must be notified, it is going to be within 8 hours?", "Did you state that?", "Jessica Flood: Yes.", "Assemblywoman Krasner: That is a good start, but as a mom, if I did not know where my child was for eight hours, I would be in a huge panic.", "I feel it is so important, for a minor especially, that they are allowed within three hours to make phone calls to a parent, a guardian, a friend, a grandparent\u2014somebody.", "In NRS 171.153, if we are allowing someone who has been arrested to have that right, we certainly should allow a child to contact a parent, a guardian, a trusted friend, a grandparent\u2014somebody.", "I feel strongly that should be included in this.", "I appreciate all your hard work, and I know I am bringing up nuances, but as a parent I feel it is so important that we have that language in here.", "What are your thoughts on that?", "Jessica Flood: I think your request is reasonable.", "As a hospital, it should be happening as soon as a child comes in.", "If law enforcement brings a child in, you would think the first thing the hospital would want to do is try to get ahold of that parent.", "With this diverse stakeholder group, there is a lot of push and pull and tension.", "There are the hospitals saying that there are situations in which they will not be able to do that.", "Then you have the parent and family advocates who say that it should be as you said, within Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 24, 2021 three hours.", "I think that is reasonable, but I do not know what the stakeholders think about that; however, I would be open to seeing what the stakeholders think about it.", "Assemblywoman Krasner: That is a vague response.", "Chair Nguyen: Assemblywoman Krasner, I will ask you to follow up with Jessica Flood.", "I know she is speaking on behalf of her position as coordinator for the Northern Regional Behavioral Health Policy Board, so she probably has a difficult time answering that on behalf of all the stakeholders she has been speaking with.", "Assemblywoman Krasner: I appreciate that.", "I just remember, when this bill came in, reading that a minor could be taken without the consent of the parents or guardian and held for basically 23 hours and 59 minutes without notifying the parents.", "One of the directors of a local youth mental hospital reached out to me and said they were mortified by the bill.", "They thought it would further traumatize children if they were not allowed to have that kind of contact or make a phone call to a parent or guardian, so for the record, I wanted to see if we could put that in there.", "Since we give that right to people who are arrested, I thought we could also give that same right to people who are taken against their will.", "Jessica Flood: Chair Nguyen, I appreciate your comment.", "This has been a group effort with probably 30 stakeholders.", "I have my own opinions, but in terms of the agreement and the process we have put in, I do not want to just agree to something because I am present in this hearing and they are not.", "On the other hand, I think it is very reasonable to think about three hours.", "Assemblywoman Krasner: Thank you.", "Chair

bringing this legislation forward.", "Senate Bill 158 (1st Reprint) amends Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 432B.623, which concerns the Kinship Guardianship Assistance Program, or KinGAP.", "The KinGAP program provides financial assistance to a relative who becomes a legal guardian of a child in foster care.", "Currently, a child's relatives are only eligible to receive financial assistance through the program if adoption and reunification have been ruled out as permanency options.", "Basically, that means that even if it is not determined to be in the best interests of the child, as long as reunification or adoption are technically out there as options, that relative caregiver would not be eligible for funding.", "Senate Bill 158 (1st Reprint) will revise this requirement so that instead of requiring ruling out adoption and reunification, a child welfare agency can determine that being returned home or adopted are not appropriate permanency options for the child.", "This is a small change to the law that would ensure that the state law is not more restrictive than federal requirements, which would expand opportunities to utilize federal dollars and ensure more permanency for kids.", "The language matches the federal Title IV-E eligibility language so we are not being overly restrictive about who can access federal dollars because there is a technical legal difference between \"not possible\" versus \"not appropriate.\"", "Maintaining family, community, and cultural ties is important for children, and adoption may not always be the best option.", "A child might have a strong relationship with their relative guardian.", "Parents may not wish to terminate their parental rights.", "The parents and the guardian may have a good relationship too, and placement

have a question specific to the bill.", "In section 1, subsection 1, paragraph (c), it reads that \".", ".", ".", "services must determine that being returned home or adopted are not appropriate permanency options for the child.\"", "Does that eliminate a family member from adopting the child?", "Gillian Block: I will let Amy Honodel elaborate on this, but no, this should just make it so that the more restrictive language in the NRS is not controlling here and it will match the federal language.", "Amy Honodel, Staff Attorney, Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada: I represent youth in foster care.", "No, it does not eliminate adoption as an option for these families.", "The way the amendment is written, adoption will still be on the table, and actually, it is best practices for us and the courts to do what is called \"concurrent\" planning so that two plans may be developed with the idea that we do not have to wait for one to be eliminated to get a youth out of the system.", "There are times when adoption may not be what the child desires; for example, if he or she is an older youth.", "No, adoption would still be on the table.", "It would also be used in a case where a parent may not want to relinquish their rights and the evidence is not concrete to terminate their parental rights.", "Assemblywoman Titus: Thank you for that clarification.", "I wanted to make sure it was on the record that the intent was not to totally eliminate adoption as an option for the child or the children.", "Chair Nguyen: Do we have any other questions from Committee members?",

three grandchildren because their mother had died.", "She did not receive any help from the state in order to take care of those children.", "If I had taken the children, I could have received foster care money.", "I am hoping this bill will eliminate that because this was a grandparent\u2014or an aunt or other relative\u2014and that a relative can receive money from the state.", "Is that what is happening with this bill?", "Amy Honodel: All relatives are eligible for financial assistance when they take children in.", "They are able to become licensed foster parents and there is a shortened class requirement.", "It is called kinship Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 24, 2021 licensing, but this bill does not affect that.", "What we are hoping to do going forward in other areas is help with the Clark County Department of Family Services and the Division of Child and Family Services within the Department of Health and Human Services.", "Washoe County is also working on this to make sure relatives are given information very early on because it is a significant financial undertaking when they take on relatives' kids, but this bill will not affect that.", "This bill in fact requires those relatives to become licensed before the case gets referred for kinship guardianship.", "The bill is so that the initial investigators are telling these relatives that they can become licensed as foster parents as well as identifying what other social service help there will be.", "Assemblywoman Thomas: I am not fully understanding that because it seems as though there may be a misunderstanding on my part that a grandparent, because they either have to adopt that child or reunify with the parent, would receive assistance.", "Amy Honodel: I am not sure where the confusion is coming from.", "Right now, the way title IV-E funding and the foster licensing programs are written and prepared, any person\u2014relative or nonrelative\u2014can become a licensed foster parent to take care of a kid.", "Ideally, at the beginning of a case when children are removed from their home, they do better with family.", "The law requires a preference for family placement.", "The social worker or case manager who is doing the placement should be advising these people, whether it is a grandparent or another relative, of the availability of licensing for them to provide a financial subsidy to them.", "The bill that is before this Committee does not affect that.", "However, it does contain the requirement that anyone who does this gets licensed and the kids are in the home with that person for six months prior to the time the guardianship is granted, so it forces the conversation.", "In the case you were referring to, that grandparent would have been eligible from the beginning, but it is not affected by this bill.", "Assemblywoman Thomas: Thank you.", "If I understand what you are saying, that grandparent or relative would need to be a licensed foster care person in order to receive assistance from the state.", "Amy Honodel: That is correct and that is regardless of what the plan is for the child.", "If the child will be going home or can be adopted, that does not affect that relative's eligibility to become licensed.", "We want these people to be supported when they have this unexpected request to take care of children who are in their family.", "Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: I have one more point of clarification.", "I see that in order to become a licensed foster care person, there is a referral to NRS 424.030.", "What is the timeline on this?", "A lot of these things happen so quickly.", "It could be death; it could be anything.", "How much time?", "As an example, when I leave here, I work full-time.", "Where do I find the time to become a licensed foster care person?", "If I am getting my licensing under NRS 424.030, are there online Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 24, 2021 classes?", "Do I have to go someplace?", "If I do not do it fast enough, are you going to take my grandbaby from me?", "How does this work, because this is really scary.", "Bailey Bortolin, Statewide Advocacy, Outreach and Policy Director, Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers: Yes, it is a scary process for everyone involved.", "KinGAP is a federal assistance program to financially assist families who are relatives who take in their children for the foster care system.", "I believe the agency works with you and works around that timeline because we have a preference for working with family members and the law to ensure that we are putting children with their relatives whenever possible.", "What this bill is fixing, to put a finer point on the question you were asking, Assemblywoman Thomas, is, everyone in the state of Nevada could agree that, in a child welfare case, the most appropriate placement is to have this permanency plan of guardianship with a relative.", "That is why we have this federal KinGAP program; a lot of families cannot afford to just pull back and have no financial assistance and have the case closed under a guardianship with grandma.", "She needs that financial assistance.", "The federal KinGAP program that exists closes that loophole by providing that funding, but the way we currently have interpreted that eligibility standard in the NRS is more restrictive than the Title IV-E federal funding actually requires us to be.", "By saying \"not possible,\" we have cases where it becomes a debate in the legal system as to what \"not possible\" means.", "Everyone could be on the same page: the social services agency, the child's social worker, the family members, the child wants this.", "Everyone wants the permanency plan to close this case and be guardianship with grandma.", "However, if it is determined that it is \"possible\" to adopt the child, then that could restrict access to the federal funding.", "By changing that word to \"appropriate\" when everyone in the child's life agrees that this is the best case going forward, we do not have to have legal arguments about whether it is \"possible\" for grandma to adopt.", "If grandma wants the kid, she should adopt the kid, and that will come with an adoption subsidy.", "In a narrow set of cases, we get into a legal argument that is unnecessarily restrictive just because of the way it is currently drafted in NRS.", "Whenever it is possible and appropriate, this will allow us to get these families the federal funding.", "This slight tweak in NRS will ensure we are giving those families that federal funding.", "Chair Nguyen: Thank you for that clarification.", "To further clarify, this makes it a lot easier in situations with grandma such as those Assemblywoman Thomas and Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong mentioned.", "Bailey Bortolin: Yes.", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: The program is run through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program.", "I want to say that there is an income threshold, so some people might not be eligible for it just because they do not meet a certain percentage of poverty.", "I think 275 percent of the federal Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 24, 2021 poverty level is what the qualifying guideline is.", "Everyone who qualifies financially and is taking in a relative or kin\u2014and kin is defined\u2014can get this.", "If there are people out there who are not getting this, it is because they are not eligible.", "There is still an eligibility piece, and that might be a consideration for people who have incomes higher than what the federal poverty level is calling for on this.", "Further down in the statute, there is language on adoptions saying that enrollment in this program should not hold up or in any negative way affect the possibility of adoption down the road, and I think it says those adoption subsidies as well.", "That is important to know.", "When this was put in statute in 2011, there was a lot of consideration for that.", "We did not want to inadvertently create a financial incentive to have to choose a path to walk down such as, do you want to do guardianship now and never adopt, or do we want to leave all doors open for that child to have permanency with their family?", "I think we have that covered.", "I just know that, in this bill, we do not see that piece of the statute, but I believe it does still exist in statute.", "Bailey Bortolin: Yes, there are a lot of considerations that go into this; however, in this bill, we are looking at one consideration where we have found that the NRS in some cases has been interpreted to be unnecessarily restrictive.", "You will still have to otherwise qualify for the program, but the unfortunate situation we have seen happen is when everyone agrees that grandma should take the child\u2014that is the plan and what all parties involved want the plan to be\u2014and we have actually seen the guardianship be granted by the court as a permanency plan, but the KinGAP federal funding has not been attached to it which leaves grandma with a financial hardship.", "In some cases that relationship will no longer be sustainable, and the child will end up back in the child welfare system.", "The funding is not necessarily indicative of whether the guardianship will be granted, it is whether the guardianship will come with financial assistance.", "In those cases, this will help the family members have access to that additional support when appropriate and when they otherwise qualify through the program.", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: I think the longest piece of becoming licensed is completing the fingerprint and background checks, so you are waiting for that process to play through.", "It would probably be tricky to try to adjust or undo that because it has all kinds of implications.", "It can either take 90 days or three months, whichever comes faster.", "Chair Nguyen: Are there further questions from Committee members?", "Seeing none, I will begin testimony in support of S.B.", "158 (R1).", "Kendall Lyons, Director of Health Policy, Children's Advocacy Alliance: For the reasons that

to what Ms. Bortolin was saying, when I was a children's attorney, I had several cases in which we had this issue where everyone wanted the grandparent or the relative\u2014the aunt, uncle, sibling\u2014to have that child and where it was best for the child to remain with the family member, but because the plan had to be guardianship and there was no financial support, that added a lot of angst and issues for the entire family.", "I urge your support of this bill.", "Joanna Jacob, Manager, Government Affairs, Clark County: We worked with legal aid and stakeholders on this bill during the interim leading up to this legislative session.", "I want to put on the record that a great number of our foster care kids are with relatives and in relative placement.", "As of March 2021, we had over 1,100 children who were staying with their relatives.", "It is something Clark County supports.", "I also want to put on the record that what we are talking about here is the subsidy.",

that placement.", "You will see in the bill that they have to be with that relative for six months.", "During that time we work with our relatives to get them licensed, and we have expedited licensing procedures.", "If the licensing is delayed, it delays the subsidy.", "It is not a situation in which we would remove the child from that family placement.", "We want to avoid disruptions to the fullest extent possible, and I wanted to state that for the record.", "We appreciate legal aid's goal in working on this bill.", "Because of the language that was in the statute, there were some issues with how that language was being interpreted.", "That is why we worked with them on this bill to mirror the federal Title IV-E language which will enable us to get the financial support to our families.", "To Assemblywoman Thomas and Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong, if you would like me to follow up with you about that process, especially if you have seen some issues in your communities, I

hospital.", "If Ms. Calvinia Williams had been on Zoom, she would have told you that in her situation they believed she was having a stroke.", "If the doctors had had their way, they would have given her medication which probably would have ultimately caused her death because what was really happening was that she was having a lupus-related incident that needed to be diagnosed.", "It turned out that there was only one doctor who happened to pass her as she was laying in the hallway, identified her symptoms, and was then able to treat her.", "She is now living with us today.", "I ran into

not have lupus, but yet they have been diagnosed for ten years.", "I recently heard a story about a woman who had been on lupus medication for the past 20 years then ran into her rheumatologist who took her off all medications and placed her on Tylenol for her pain and inflammation.", "Tylenol has the effect of damaging kidneys in lupus patients, so she is now in a pickle because they are saying that she is a problem patient rather than listening to her and understanding that she knows her care better than anyone else and that she is trying to tell the doctor exactly what is going on with her, but yet he is not hearing her.", "Now she is in a state of panic because she needs to find another doctor who can take care of her.", "She is worried about the absence of the medications because he removed those medications from her, and now she is on nothing and trying to figure out how she can tell her story to a physician and, hopefully, get to a primary care physician who can get her back

other diseases that the patient suffers from [paragraph (d)], and the information concerning the usage and access to health care services by the patient [paragraph (e)].", "That is key because they

be nice if, once we pass this bill and get aligned with the national standards, we could become a part of a surveillance project and start to develop and lift up these patients so we can identify their associated disorders and the variants and the access-to-care issues they are facing.", "Further on in section 8, subsection 1, paragraphs (a), (b), and (c), it lays out the information

diagnosed with lupus and its variants who are over 60 years of age, and the transition of patients diagnosed with lupus and its variants from pediatric to adults upon reaching 18 years of age.", "This

qualified person or designee shall analyze this information pursuant to sections 5, 6, and 7.", "In section 9, subsection 2, the Chief Medical Officer or designee will determine if there is a trend that exists in the usage of and access to health care.", "This is important because it lays out that after they make the determination, they are then supposed to work with appropriate government, educational, and research entities to investigate the trends and advance research into the trends and facilitate the treatment of lupus and its variants and associated disorders.", "Section 10 allows the Division to apply for and accept grants, gifts, and donations to carry out sections 2 through 12, and continues to discuss how they are going to coordinate and administer any other state programs related to lupus.", "I wanted to make sure this bill tied them into any federal activity or any state activity going on so they are coordinating at every Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 24, 2021 chance they possibly can with other states to move themselves ahead.", "With that, I am open for any questions.", "Chair Nguyen: Thank you, Senator Neal.", "Go ahead, Assemblywoman Titus.", "Assemblywoman Titus: I appreciate your bringing this forward, and I absolutely share your passion and caring for your constituents and all Nevadans.", "I have a couple of technical questions about the bill.", "Under section 5, subsection 3, you mention that hospitals, medical labs, and other facilities should provide screening, et cetera, and that you have to provide that information unless it has been provided by someone else.", "How would they know that, so as to prevent double reporting?", "How will they know it has already been provided?", "Senator Neal: That will be a key piece that the Department will have to deal with.", "For the data, right now we are using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes in order to identify whether they went to an emergency room or have inpatient care.", "There is an absence of data, so this bill would help refine and make sure we are not getting double the information.", "We do not have the full set of data we need in order to do the analysis and determine access to care and the treatments around the variants.", "That is what I thought was unique.", "When I asked what data they actually had on lupus, I asked that the biostatistician send me anything they had on lupus.", "That is why I uploaded what I did receive in the exhibits because we need to actually collect data.", "I cannot tell you that it will not be duplicated.", "We need to get into the fray and find out what is there, pull it from all the areas, and then do the analysis.", "From that benchmark, we need to make sure that the standard of the information being recorded is just coming from one entity.", "I do know that there is a small subset outside of the hospital because they either see a rheumatologist or a primary care doctor.", "Assemblywoman Titus: As a primary care doctor, a family practice doctor, I have seen many patients who thought they might have lupus or who were subsequently diagnosed with lupus, so it is not something just limited to women of color.", "It is throughout the spectrum, but especially in women.", "Getting in to see a rheumatologist is the X factor.", "We have to do all these tests prior because we have so few rheumatologists in the state.", "Before I could refer a patient, I would have to send all the tests I ordered.", "In order to get permission from their insurance companies to obtain the tests, I would have to use an ICD-9 code to justify the tests, so I wanted clarification on how they were reporting and on duplication of reporting.", "I certainly understand your comment that in order to even start, we have to have some sort of template to get started with the data.", "Then we can go through it later.", "Do any other states have this model?", "Would Nevada be the first state that does this, or are you using some other state's successes?", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 24, 2021 Senator Neal: I pretty much built this bill off my sickle cell bill, but they are doing it in California.", "It is my understanding that they are also doing some work in New York and Georgia and maybe in another state.", "In 2011, Illinois passed a lupus education awareness act; in 2014, Georgia created a council on lupus for education awareness, so other states have done different variations.", "California has been the surveillance project that has been with the CDC, but Illinois and Georgia focus more on education awareness.", "This bill, S.B.", "175 (R1), is getting into reporting and doing a registry which I was trying to match with what California is doing.", "Assemblywoman Titus: Thank you for that, and thank you for your passion, Senator Neal.", "Chair Nguyen: Next we will go to a question from Assemblywoman Thomas.", "Assemblywoman Thomas: I love the bill and I would also like to be a cosponsor on the bill.", "I know this is crunch time, but, for the record, I would like to note that.", "My question concerns the reports.", "After all the reports are in, is there a way for the Legislature to get the reports so they do not just sit on someone's desk collecting dust?", "Senator Neal: I want to acknowledge Assemblywoman Titus because what she said is true.", "If you look at the data, 88 percent of people with lupus are women.", "To your question, Assemblywoman Thomas, I have not considered giving this information to the Legislature because the reverse may occur\u2014reports sit on legislators' desks, so I have more interest in it going to the Department where they are more engaged and active in looking at the information.", "The way the bill is set up, the Chief Medical Officer will engage in analysis and do an assessment to determine trends.", "If it went to the Legislature, you would see it as a report\u2014and we get many reports.", "Unless you specifically look for it, it has value only to the person seeking it out.", "I am not going to say this in a negative way, because we tie ourselves to legislative reports.", "We believe that the Legislature is this esteemed body, but unless you are totally engaged in making sure something happens\u2014following your legislation, looking at the reports, the data, and acting upon those agencies\u2014that is the only value of the legislative report.", "You have to actually make the Legislature, esteemed body that it is, have the power and authority to go to the person and say, You have not responded to this data and I need you to respond to this data.", "For now, I am going to keep it with the Department of Health and Human Services.", "Assemblywoman Thomas: Thank you, Senator Neal, I appreciate that, but I also had a vested interest.", "You mentioned neonatal lupus.", "I am very concerned about that.", "Senator Neal: I will add you to my bill.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 24, 2021 Assemblyman Matthews: I appreciate the question from Assemblywoman Titus, as I was curious along those same lines.", "In response, I think you said that California has a registry along these lines.", "Could you speak to what they are doing with that information?", "Has it led to policy changes, or are policy changes in the works?", "Have there been any changes or improvements in health outcomes?", "I guess that would depend partially on how old the registry is or how long they have been doing this, but I was hoping you could speak to what has occurred in California as a result of this.", "Senator Neal: California attempted legislation twice, once in 2011.", "It did not pass then, so they tried again in 2014, and then they got connected to the CDC.", "It is my understanding that the work they have been doing is a part of the National Lupus Patient Registry.", "They have managed to get consecutive funding from Congress of about $9.5 million.", "They also funded $10 million for a lupus research program in which California\u2014and possibly Georgia\u2014is a part of the CDC's surveillance project.", "In addition, in 2020 because of the work that has been happening\u2014giving information to the CDC and the national group\u2014they got $2 million for the lupus program.", "Also, the National Institutes of Health, the largest public funder of research, was given an increase of $1.25 billion.", "It is my understanding that, since roughly 2014, they have been building this National Lupus Patient Registry and they have been able to leverage funding and create research programs in order to help other states.", "I wanted S.B.", "175 (R1) to become a part of this national work and that Nevada get into play.", "I did not find out that we were behind the times until I got this document from Director Richard Whitley who told me that S.B.", "175 (R1) aligned with a 2015 agenda around lupus work.", "Since it is now 2021, I said we should get in the game\u2014we are six years behind\u2014and start playing in this national work.", "Assemblyman Matthews: In terms of the initial consequences in California, it has resulted in access to additional funding.", "It is perhaps premature to say whether that is getting us on the road, presumably to improved health outcomes and changes in policy beyond that.", "They are still in the phase of bringing in financial funding for this at this point.", "Is that correct?", "Senator Neal: The latest report from the CDC said that they were able to document 16,000 new cases per year.", "I think the registry has helped them reach that 16,000-per-year number.", "I would not say that they are in the forming stages.", "They probably started at an infant stage around 2014 or 2015, and then they have successfully grown.", "I just want Nevada to be a player because we have a lupus population here that feels as though they are drowning and not a part of the care.", "Ms. Calvinia Williams created an organization in order to do the work in Las Vegas and is doing it all on her own, reaching out to women.", "This gives her a chance to take the work she has done and leverage it into the state and, hopefully, into a national conversation to say that Nevada has lupus patients who need to be a part of the work.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 24, 2021 Assemblywoman Peters: Thank you for bringing this bill.", "We have a familial connection with lupus, and it is a pretty terrifying disease with the unknowns and some of the ways it expresses itself.", "The information around it is not readily available.", "My question is about the reporting expectations in the bill.", "Are you expecting that the reporting would be defined through the regulatory structure?", "Senator Neal: Yes.", "In section 6 it is by regulation.", "Assemblywoman Peters: From there, are you expecting that the regulations will ask for reporting per case or on an annual basis?", "By which provider will this happen, the individual provider or the facility in which the provider works?", "Senator Neal: The intent is that whether it be a hospital, medical laboratory, or other facility that is either providing the screening or the diagnostic or therapeutic services, they are reporting that information to the State Board of Health.", "That is the goal.", "Assemblywoman Peters: Will that be annual, or is it more important to get it up-front and see it as the diagnosis is happening?", "Senator Neal: It is supposed to be happening when they go, within that six-month window.", "It is not annually, but they will be reporting when those cases come through, and there should be a compiling moment.", "In section 7, subsection 2 where it says, \".", ".", ".", "the manner and not later than 6 months .", ".", ".\"", "the Division abstracts the information and then we have the analysis that occurs.", "We are collecting, then we are going to abstract the information, then we are going to do the analysis to determine if there are trends.", "Chair Nguyen: Do we have any other questions from members?",

also like to thank the Committee on Health and Human Services.", "I am pleased.", "Lupus of Nevada, Inc., our agency, is advocacy and education awareness.", "One of the things we want to see with S.B.", "175 (R1) is accountability, the reporting process in this.", "When our lupus individuals go to the doctors, and this has been over 17 years in Nevada doing this, they will come out with no answers at all.", "The second thing I would like to have is the demographics of this.", "That is what we really wanted, to hold that accountable so the registry can get their hands on it and we can fight to get grants.", "We do not know how many people in Nevada have it.", "My people call me Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 24, 2021 daily complaining about the fact that they went into their doctor, went to California, have been diagnosed for 16 years, moved here 6 months ago, one physician told them they did not have lupus, took all their medicine away, and now they are told to get on Tylenol.", "We need accountability with this because we need to figure out what is going on for someone who has been on medication for 16 years.", "Now this individual does not have any doctor.", "I get concerned and agitated because I am a major advocate for this.", "We need your help, and this bill is going to do it for us.", "It is going to set boundaries and standards determined by the diversity of the people who have it here in the west side, the south, the southwest.", "A lot of people are not going to the doctors because they are not going to get the outcomes that they are expecting to get.", "That is why I feel it is so important for this bill.", "Chair Nguyen: Is there anyone else to testify in support?", "[There was no one.]", "Next, I will go to testimony in opposition to S.B.", "175 (R1).", "[There was none.]", "Do we have anyone testifying in neutral?", "[There was no one.]", "With that, I will call our bill sponsor up to make any closing remarks.",

health information.", "Failing to prioritize information access can result in public health disinformation and distrust, which is in direct alignment to an environment that can foster vaccine hesitancy.", "Vaccine hesitancy, as in the refusal of vaccines despite the availability of these services, is a very real problem here in Nevada that will become apparent within the next few weeks, especially as we begin to expand our reach to marginalized groups that have been abused and neglected for years.", "In public health, we use the term \"health literacy\" to describe a person's ability to find, understand, and use information and services to inform health-related decisions and actions for themselves and others around them.", "Health literacy is an important thing to consider in developing programs that improve the community's health status, mostly because it Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 24, 2021 acknowledges any present limitations and emphasizes the ability to use health information, not simply to just understand it.", "To make well-informed decisions, health literacy skills are needed.", "This means that the wide range of our population must have the adequate foundational knowledge of a health problem before even considering the implications that may arise.", "As legislators and public servants, the reality of this pandemic is that we have not done our best with how this response has taken shape, mostly because we did not have the right infrastructure in place to carry out a good response.", "If we want to fix the disparities observed in communities of color, we have to take the right step to invest in public health services that will achieve good outcomes.", "The biggest takeaway from today is that health literacy starts at the distribution of information, and information is accessible when it is done in a culturally competent manner within your own native language.", "Your language is your culture, and your culture can modulate your perceptions of what health can mean to you.", "With the permission of the Chair, I will turn this over to Ms. Olivia Whiteley, Western States Advocacy Officer from the Refugee Advocacy Lab, to give her remarks on the bill language and a brief rundown on the intended outcomes on Senate Bill 318 (1st Reprint).", "Olivia Whiteley, Western States Advocacy Officer, Refugee

preferred language of every individual who receives COVID-19 services; provide limited English proficient individuals with interpretation services, either Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 24, 2021 in-person or remotely; translate vital documents such as applications or notices related to COVID-19; translate governmental orders related to COVID-19; and collaborate with community-based organizations to ensure all local languages are represented.", "The requirements for language services are proportionate to the number and language of limited English proficient individuals served by the division or health district, ensuring smaller health districts do not have to provide services in the same frequency or breadth as larger health districts.", "If a health district only serves individuals who speak Spanish, Arabic, and Hindi, that district only has to provide services in those languages.", "The Division of Public and Behavioral Health submitted a

implementation, many agencies eliminated or significantly decreased their fiscal notes [Exhibit I, Exhibit J, Exhibit K, and Exhibit L].", "Senate Bill 318 (1st Reprint) is a relatively low-cost,

culturally and linguistically appropriate services policy from 2018.", "These policies contain several praiseworthy components that S.B.", "318 (R1) would require of all agencies.", "However, even these policies are four to five years old and lack standardization.", "For example, the culturally and linguistically appropriate services policy defines an interpreter or translator as an individual who has a bachelor's degree from an accredited institution, preferably in languages or linguistics, and possesses at least one year of specialized experience, while the LEP policy has no such definition or qualifications requirement.", "As both policies are specific to the same program area within DCFS, Children's Mental Health Services, this fundamental determination of who is competent to interpret or translate treatment options, eligibility requirements, or medical conditions to parents whose children are facing mental health difficulties should be standardized.", "If you look through other publicly available DHHS LEP policies, you will see a further lack of standardization.", "Some of these policies are a single paragraph, and some are not publicly available.", "The agency or division an individual is dealing with should not determine an individual's ability to access essential information in their preferred language about programs that they are eligible for but which are funded by their tax dollars\u2014nor should an individual's ZIP Code.", "It is possible and likely that the agency and its divisions have additional policies, plans, and resources for ensuring language access that are not readily available to the public.", "Further, this is not intended as a comprehensive evaluation of the existing language access work of these departments.", "Across the state agencies and departments we have spoken with, all have expressed a very strong desire to expand their language access offerings, but have a general lack of resources to do so.", "Senate Bill 318 (1st Reprint) provides a statutory basis for all agencies to include funding to support the implementation of their language access plans in their biennial budget requests, bridging the gap between agency intent and the resources available to each agency.", "My final remark, and perhaps my most important remark, is that S.B.", "318 (R1) is a civil rights issue that underlines all other activities of this Committee.", "One primary objective, if not the primary objective, of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was to prevent the discriminatory Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 24, 2021 use of public funds, ensuring that all who paid taxes were able to access the goods and services those dollars subsidized.", "The Act's prohibition of discrimination on the basis of national origin was explicitly extended to language access in the Supreme Court's 1974 Lau v.

removed?", "Senator Donate: Over the last couple of months we have had extensive conversations with each of the departments and agencies as to how this would be implemented once it becomes law.", "I think it is very clear from our conversations with each of the agencies and departments that this is something they have wanted for a very long time, but the question is how do we get to language access?", "Part of the amendment we submitted in the Senate was to reiterate to the departments and agencies that Ms. Whiteley and I are not looking for implementation.", "We are looking for them to determine what they need to implement language access.", "That has been made clear by the fiscal notes that have been removed.", "There is only one fiscal note outstanding, and that is with the Department of Corrections.", "We made clear to them that our bill only creates an access plan and is simply an exercise and not for implementation.", "Vice Chair Peters: Thank you.", "I did look at some of that language and the fiscal note.", "It is my understanding from your language that you are not requiring an additional person, just somebody who may have interest in this who can champion it through their offices.", "Are there any other questions?", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: Thank you for this bill.", "In previous conversations, the intersection between language access and health equity is the new, big policy frontier we are going to have to battle moving Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services May 24, 2021 forward.", "Future Legislatures will decide whether we do it

other departments, tell me more about the type of work product you are hoping to see from them.", "Senator Donate: I will turn that over to Ms. Olivia Whiteley, who can speak more to that.", "Olivia Whiteley: There are a couple of outcomes we are hoping to see from the language access plans that are required under section 7.", "One of the primary purposes for creating the plans required under section 7 would be to allow agencies to develop a robust, detailed understanding of what costs would be associated with implementing that language access plan and ensuring that all Nevadans could understand and access their services.", "The bill requires agencies to submit that fiscal note in the 2023-2025 biennium so that can be a discussion occurring in the Legislature during that period.", "All the language access planning components are purposed toward ensuring that agencies can then take that next step to implementation.", "In regard to the content of the plan, you are correct in that, first, it does require agencies to gather demographic data; this can be done in a couple of different ways.", "Second it requires agencies to include in their language access plans an inventory of existing services.", "This inventory was based off the U.S. Department of Justice's language access assessment and planning tools.", "It goes through things like what training is provided to employees, and it is fairly specific.", "It asks them if they provide employees with training on how to talk with a limited English proficient individual over the phone, via email, or in person; so it goes through a checklist of those existing services.", "The language access plan also requires agencies to report on ways where laws might need to be modified to better serve limited English proficient Nevadans.", "It requires agencies to evaluate where areas that translator and interpreter certifications are not listed for their particular agency activities.", "Perhaps in conjunction, there would be workforce development opportunities.", "Sometimes for these less frequently spoken languages, there is even a lack of local interpretation or translation resources available for agencies to use, so it also attempts to fill some of those gaps.", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: I appreciate that.", "I know it is a long, hard road.", "I already have a June 10 meeting on my calendar for the Information Technology Advisory Board.", "It is the committee that looks at the technology of the state.", "Obviously, our meetings were disrupted during the pandemic, but in that

six months ago was that we are more than a decade away from being fully ADA-compliant just on our state's websites.", "What I have learned is, wherever you can fit it in to different pieces as they are moving, jump on it there.", "As long as we are having the conversation about modernizing some of our systems and we talk about accessibility, we should make sure to add language to that accessibility as well.", "For those pieces we are starting to modernize now, at least we can look at a language component and play catch-up on everything else.", "As much as you can, I would hope you would want this section to be liberally construed to make sure that the Executive Branch departments, where they see an opportunity to do this work, that they can.", "It may not be a symmetrical kind of progress; it might be asymmetrical where you will see certain departments moving ahead of others.", "Some may be more organically equipped and come at this from a different direction than others.",

us to a better place.", "Assemblywoman Titus: Senator Donate, thank you for bringing this forward.", "This problem is real.", "During this COVID-19 epidemic we had significant issues reaching out to

record now that I reached out to Assemblyman Flores and Assemblywoman Torres to help me put together information even though the state had information out there.", "I asked for help interpreting that information, and I got recommendations; so having a process, not only in Spanish, but also in a format that someone reading it would understand and not be threatened by.", "This was more a comment, but I wanted to thank you for bringing this forward.", "I think this is important, and for those doubters, it was a significant aha moment for me this last summer when we could not get the information out that we needed to get out, not only in their language, but in whatever the translation was they would accept and trust.", "The health care system is all about building trust.", "We do not just want some bureaucrat to write it in Spanish, which was not really their language anyway.", "It was a textbook kind of interpretation, so I think there is a huge need here.", "Vice Chair Peters: Are

Concerning the Costs of Prescription Drugs.", "I hold two master's degrees from the University of Nevada, Reno\u2014one in political science, the other in social work.", "I am also a licensed social worker and worked for the Aging and Disability Services Division of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) before joining the LCB.", "I am originally from Munich, Bavaria, in Germany, and since 2009 I have been living in Nevada for most of the time.", "I am really honored to serve as your committee policy analyst, and I am looking forward to working with all of you.", "Chair Nguyen: Karly O'Krent and Patrick Ashton are valuable resources for all the members on this Committee, so please reach out to them as you are looking through bills if you have questions about them.", "Patrick and Karly are here to help all of us on the Committee understand and get through the sometimes very complex nature of working through these bill draft requests as we are going through the session, so please take advantage of their knowledge and resources.", "They are fantastic people as well.", "Our first order of business today is the adoption of the Committee policies [Exhibit C].", "They were posted on the Legislature's website and I believe we had the opportunity to also email them to Committee members.", "They are policies I am sure you have probably all voted on; they are very similar to those approved in other committees.", "They serve as a complement to the Assembly Standing Rules and the Joint Standing Rules we adopted as a legislative body on Monday in the full Assembly.", "Due to the virtual format of some of our meetings, some additional virtual meeting policies have been added.", "Are there any questions or comments regarding those policies?", "I do not Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 3, 2021 see any, so I will entertain a motion at this time to adopt the Committee policies for the Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services.", "ASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS MOVED TO ADOPT THE COMMITTEE POLICIES FOR THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES.", "ASSEMBLYWOMAN TITUS SECONDED THE MOTION.", "THE MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY.", "This next document was on the Nevada Electronic Legislative Information System (NELIS) and was probably also provided to you in an email.", "I will have our committee policy analyst present the Committee Brief [Exhibit D].", "Patrick Ashton: Before I start, I have a little reminder that as non-partisan legislative staff I cannot advocate or oppose any of the proposals that come before you.", "I am here to assist the Chair and members with any questions concerning policies that may arise.", "My only agenda is to be objective and provide you with unbiased information.", "I am available to assist the Committee and its members on any issues related to health and human services.", "In addition, the Research Division is available to provide information and assistance on a confidential basis to individual members of the Legislature on any topic.", "Please feel free to reach out to me or any of my colleagues at any time.", "You have all been provided with an electronic copy of the Committee Brief, and you can also find a copy on NELIS.", "This brief provides background information on the work of the Committee and policy issues that you may consider this session.", "During the 2019 Legislative Session, this Committee considered a total of 46 Assembly and 41 Senate bills and resolutions for a total of 87 measures [page 3, Exhibit D].", "Seventy-four of these were voted out of the Committee and the Legislature approved 68 measures.", "That means that, of the original 87 measures, over three-quarters of them were signed into law.", "Though it appears this Committee was quite busy last session, let us see what may happen this session.", "Please turn to the next four pages [pages 4-7].", "For the next four months, we can expect hearings about many health and human services issues in this Committee, in the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, or on the floor of the Assembly.", "The pandemic caused by the coronavirus disease of 2019, COVID-19, will dominate any measures you will consider this session either directly or indirectly.", "For example, you might consider matters related to public health, behavioral health and substance use, access to health care, and prescription drug costs, just to highlight a few of them.", "The Committee Brief provides background information on these highlights.", "In the next couple of weeks, we will also hear additional presentations from experts on public health, mental health, and Medicaid.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 3, 2021 I would like to note that a correction in the brief in the Behavioral Health and Substance Use Prevention section [page 5, Exhibit D].", "The first sentence of that section stated, \"More than a quarter of adults in Nevada have a mental health disorder .", ".", ".", ".\"", "That is incorrect.", "Instead, it should read, \"More than one-fifth of adults in Nevada have a mental health disorder .", ".", ".", ".\"", "Actually, it is 20.7 percent, to be exact.", "You will find an updated Committee Brief uploaded on the Committee's web page.", "On the next two pages [pages 8 and 9] you will find an overview of relevant audits, reports, and studies such as interim committee bulletins that summarize the work of committees and studies during the past interim; reports from certain issues that the Legislative Committee on Health Care studied; and legislative audits from the Legislative Counsel Bureau's Audit Division.", "The Committee Brief contains hyperlinks to the reports and bulletins if you would like to dig deeper into certain issues.", "Finally, you will find a separate document in your meeting materials that lists relevant state and local agency contacts [Exhibit E].", "The agencies included are those that are likely to come before this Committee at some point during this session.", "This concludes my presentation, and I welcome any questions you may have.", "Chair Nguyen: Does anyone have any questions for Patrick at this time?", "I do not see any.", "As I said, he is an invaluable resource to our Committee.", "He is there to answer all your questions in a straightforward way.", "I appreciate all his help in getting ready for today, and I look forward to working with him for the rest of the session, as I am sure you all will.", "We will now move into our only presentation today.", "I asked Director Whitley to present a very broad overview of the Department of Health and Human Services.", "A tremendous amount of our state budget is related to health care.", "We have a wonderful director who manages all this, and I will ask him to introduce himself.", "Keep in mind that we do have other presentations coming up that will provide more detailed discussions about some of the agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services.", "Richard Whitley, Director, Department of Health and Human Services: I am grateful that the Chair has allowed us to take some deeper dives into aspects of health and human services such as Nevada Medicaid, behavioral health, and a focus on the state's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.", "I plan to show you a few slides, starting with this one [page 2, Exhibit F] which references our Department's authority and mission.", "We have a population-based approach to health care and a public health approach to prevention and intervention.", "The next slide [page 3] summarizes how the Department is organized into five divisions as shown in the gray boxes.", "They are framed around populations served, such as Aging and Disability Services and Child and Family Services; and functions, such as Public and Behavioral Health, Welfare and Supportive Services, and Nevada Medicaid.", "Each of the divisions comes equipped with all the standard bureaucratic components\u2014personnel, information technology, and financing.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 3, 2021 The next slide [page 4, Exhibit F] represents the total number of full-time staff in the Department.", "The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) employs a staff of over 6,000 and the majority work in a direct service capacity.", "This session, there is a request for 288 additional staff\u2014primarily due to caseload growth in various programs.", "The budget is shown on the next slide [page 5].", "For fiscal years 2022 and 2023, DHHS represents 48 percent of the state's total budget; that represents all the funding sources, both from the state's General Fund and from the federal match.", "Within the DHHS budget, Medicaid represents 78 percent of the total amount spent.", "You can see that DHHS has the largest spend of any single state agency, and that spend is primarily in Nevada Medicaid.", "To frame the high-level overview, I would like to go back to talking about our structure [page 3].", "When you look at our programs, you have to look at them in the context of how we operationalize them in the community and what our role is.", "Our role includes the direct delivery of service, the funding of service, and the regulating or enforcement of service delivery.", "So we have all three of these components, and sometimes they exist in a single program.", "For example, in public health we only have two local health districts in our state\u2014the Washoe County Health District and the Southern Nevada Health District.", "The remainder of the state falls under DHHS for public health.", "We do have a quad-county collaborative led by Carson City, but that is not a health district.", "We are one of the few states in the nation that have this model where the state assumes some direct responsibilities for public health.", "Social services are another area.", "There are county social services in every county, but they play very different roles.", "In Clark and Washoe Counties, child welfare is delivered at the county level, but for the remainder of the state, the state has oversight for child welfare.", "This makes for a challenge sometimes because the same oversight for direct service delivery is also oversight for the entire state.", "So sometimes we are partners, but sometimes we are enforcement or regulatory in terms of a statewide system.", "This is also true in mental health.", "The state never formally transitioned, as other states did, from state-operated mental health to county-operated mental health to community-operated mental health, or certainly not at the pace the rest of the nation did decades ago.", "Until the expansion of Medicaid, the state was the single largest provider of behavioral health services.", "The transition to a more community-based strategy has really developed with the expansion of Medicaid, allowing consumers to have a choice about where they go to get services, and with the legislation that created the regional behavioral health boards.", "Before the expansion of Medicaid, we were one of only three states that operated behavioral health with the state being the primary care provider.", "In Medicaid, this model is primarily a managed care model in Clark and Washoe Counties and a fee-for-service model in rural Nevada.", "Additionally, there are populations such as the blind, aged, and disabled that are in a fee-for-service environment.", "The service delivery approach is really complex and costly, both in terms of the vulnerable populations that are served as well as the actual financial cost for that delivery.", "While trying to reduce the number of people who are uninsured, for the past four or five years we have struggled to really implement health care in an environment that has been made difficult by the notion of repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and even affecting the Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 3, 2021 expansion of Medicaid.", "As we moved forward to mature our health care system, we had a lot of challenges along the way, further complicated this past year with the COVID-19 pandemic.", "It is important to note that this was already a very fragile environment, due primarily to the fact that much of our state is a health care workforce shortage area; access to primary care, specialty services, and even health facilities such as long-term care and hospitals remain very vulnerable in some communities.", "During the pandemic we have had challenges, but we have also had opportunities identified.", "We may have moved more quickly or taken bigger or bolder steps to be responsive than we would have otherwise, but some of these things are too good not to build off of as we go forward.", "For example, telehealth has really increased access, especially in the area of behavioral health.", "That is largely due to the groundwork that legislators did on framing telehealth.", "We were pretty much ready to go with the implementation, including with Medicaid, and that allowed us to continue with service provisions during the pandemic.", "A second opportunity is the expansion of the scope of practice.", "A good example of that is pharmacists and pharmacy techs as immunizers.", "A lot of focus is on the workforce shortage areas.", "I am happy to share with you, or you can browse around on our website, that we have a Primary Care Office.", "It does the assessment of the shortage areas for the United States Department of Health and Human Services.", "Those shortage areas then become vehicles for application for funding to become federally qualified health centers or for health care workers for loan repayments.", "Much of our state is a workforce shortage area as it relates to health care, but the challenge of producing more doctors and nurses is just that\u2014a challenge.", "However, we have seen some improvement in terms of broadening the scope of practice of some of the existing disciplines.", "Discussions are always tense when it comes to licensing boards and scopes of practice, but I think we have seen some benefit, especially in the area of vaccinators.", "The third area we have seen an opportunity for growth in is data analytics.", "Those of you who sit on the budget committee will note that one of the few moves we are making within our Department this legislative session is the request to move data analytics under my office.", "Data analytics, much like financing, is usually categorical.", "We have programs that may come with a federal grant and have all the bells and whistles for data analytics, and then we have other programs that are largely reliant on the State General Fund that have very little in terms of capability for data analytics.", "I am most proud of the work of Kyra Morgan, our state biostatistician.", "If you look on the website for the COVID-19 tracker, Nevada early on scored an A+ compared to other states with our transparency and data, largely due to the work of our state biostatistician and her staff.", "It is not just data for the sake of data, but it is really the analytics of the data that serves to inform us.", "We have utilized that data daily as it relates to who is being tested, who is not being tested, where we are seeing outbreaks, and where to target our limited resources.", "I did not want this to just be an event that occurred with COVID-19, because bringing the analytics together and sharing some best practices as well as sharing the dashboarding is really rich.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 3, 2021 If you go on the main page of the DHHS website and you look on the right-hand side under \"Nevada Health Profiles,\" Kyra created a data dashboard by districts and counties.", "You can pull up your legislative districts and look at the health indicators for the people you represent.", "You can also find the health care coverage, the uninsured rate, the insured rate by payer source, and demographics.", "It is a really rich tool.", "That is one thing that has come out of the pandemic that I intend to keep pushing.", "We rarely ask for general funds related to data analytics because the service line is generally so long.", "We know where the need is\u2014in behavioral health and substance abuse\u2014so the idea that we would pull resources for analytics has been too tough to put forward.", "But I do think in this organizational structure, without costing any more money, we have the ability to share the knowledge and capabilities for data analytics.", "I had a great conversation earlier this week with Joan Hall, Executive Director of Nevada Rural Health Partners, the association of rural hospitals\u2014most of which are critical access hospitals.", "On her web page, you need only look at the tool box she created for data reporting for rural hospitals.", "Now hospitals know what they need to report, but what you do not see is what we do with all that data\u2014how we translate that to information that is actionable.", "With this look at data analytics, I am hopeful that I can come before you next session with some recommendations\u2014perhaps even changing some of the reporting requirements.", "There is a tendency sometimes in government to pile on requirements without pausing to see whether those requirements still serve the same purpose, or whether there might now be other ways to get at the intended goal.", "This is illustrated very clearly when it comes to data collection.", "And then what do we do with it?", "If we collect it, I believe we should do something with it that would inform on strategies for how to either make improvements or go upstream and prevent a costly health outcome.", "Those are a few things I wanted to highlight which are the silver lining in our need to do work differently.", "As Chair Nguyen said, you will get a deeper dive into Medicaid.", "Our financing of Medicaid is historically dependent upon the counties, the taxing.", "When expanded, we did not change the way we funded it.", "Most of you who were serving during the special session know that we initially came before the legislative body with some dramatic reductions because the economy could not continue to support the level of services.", "Our financing of health care is fragile.", "We have opportunities with provider fees that are optional, but we have not had any providers take advantage of that other than what is required in statute for managed care and skilled nursing facilities to pay fees.", "I feel as though our agency had good momentum coming out of the last session, but we have really had to focus.", "It has been all hands on deck related to the COVID-19 pandemic.", "One other highlight I should mention is our oversight of health care.", "If you have been around during the last decade, you know that Nevada had a large exposure to hepatitis C in an ambulatory surgery center in Las Vegas.", "It has been ten years, but one thing that came out of that horrible event was that we embedded facility epidemiologists, disease investigators, into our regulatory agency\u2014the Bureau of Health Care Quality and Compliance.", "I am very proud of the work Margot Chappel and Lisa Sherych have done to ensure that our health facilities are safe.", "We have had tragedies, we have had deaths, but when you look at Nevada Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 3, 2021 compared to other states, we rank among the lowest.", "We are responsive when there is an outbreak, whether connected with employee training, lack of equipment, or policy.", "We are quick to get in, identify the problem, and find solutions.", "I am very proud of our regulatory environment and that it is not regulatory in isolation.", "It is regulatory that enters from the belief that we share the same goal\u2014to be compliant.", "I have not seen other states operate in this way and not even the federal government where the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' regulatory arm operates in a silo.", "I am quite proud, and it was demonstrated once again in the effectiveness of the work with our regulators to keep our most vulnerable protected in health facilities.", "Another slide [page 6, Exhibit F] lists the bill drafts from our Department that will, for the most part, be appearing before you in this Committee.", "That concludes my formal presentation, and I am happy to answer any questions.", "I am also happy to speak with any of you who have bills.", "As you see in our organizational chart, we have touchpoints to a vast variety of issues surrounding health care such as financing it, regulating it, and delivering it to all populations.", "What usually happens in the Legislature is that something may be a great idea until it gets a fiscal note, and then the fiscal note becomes the stall.", "What I have found when we reach out to legislators about what they are trying to do is that sometimes the program may be something we already have, although not in that context.", "If you have an interest in an area that would help people, and we have a piece of the program or the components of it, we might be able to work together.", "Chair Nguyen: That was a wonderful presentation, as always.", "Assemblywoman Titus mentioned that you have amazing historical knowledge since you have been in this position for a while.", "Reaching out to you, I felt we put a lot on your plate, but I appreciate your willingness to be able to make health care accessible and affordable.", "One philosophy I have in life and here in the Legislature is that if there is a problem, does the bill actually solve that problem?", "I think what you said is very important: sometimes there are already solutions out there; sometimes there are already laws out there; sometimes there are already programs out there.", "That leads to the first question I have for you.", "On your organizational chart, you showed five main divisions of DHHS.", "We always focus on specifics to health care services, but can you touch more on the other social services managed through DHHS?", "How many different programs are there within those five main divisions?", "Richard Whitley: One that does not get a lot of focus is the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services (DWSS).", "That is the eligibility engine for multiple services.", "I would like to applaud the staff who work in that program.", "They are mostly frontline eligibility workers, some of whom were consumers of those services at one time.", "Administrator Steve Fisher has created a pipeline for opportunity for people who may be recipients of some of the services to become employees.", "I am very proud of the work they do in eligibility.", "The welfare division provided staff to the Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation during its Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 3, 2021 struggles with the application process.", "The reason for this is that Welfare and Supportive Services has an integrated model for eligibility, so it is an engine that populates whether it is Medicaid or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.", "Those are all programs, but they have different financial eligibilities.", "Temporary Assistance for Needy Families has the lowest eligibility\u2014about 100 percent of poverty.", "Interestingly, during this pandemic we have seen the caseload in that program go down.", "It was lower than what was projected during the last legislative session.", "However, in programs like Medicaid and SNAP we have an increase in the eligibility.", "From a government standpoint, what is most important about this work is how they do it.", "They do it with a single electronic application, so if people are eligible for other programs, there are prompts to complete the application so they do not have to get in multiple lines.", "The Division of Welfare and Supportive Services went through a lean process and has a model called \"One and Done.\"", "When a consumer approaches them with a need, their eligibility staff are able to help those people meet their need with their application and complete the service.", "Prior to this, if you wanted to apply for a categorical program you had to get in the categorical line.", "If there were errors, you had to start over.", "I hold this up as an efficiency in government that many other programs in other departments could benefit from looking at.", "With food security and nutrition as determinants of health, DWSS touches that area through SNAP as well as our Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program.", "Food security during the pandemic has become a real focus area for people who have never had to access these supports in the past.", "A lot of people have needed assistance navigating how to get access, and then there is the need among older Nevadans to remove some of the stigma.", "If I could, I would change the title of DWSS.", "The term \"welfare\" puts some elderly or senior folks off in terms of accessing services such as food.", "Senior meal programs are operated in the Aging and Disability Services Division\u2014Meals on Wheels\u2014and have become even more important as senior centers closed because of the risks and more meals are being delivered.", "Our major partner in that program\u2014Catholic Charities of Southern Nevada\u2014really expanded its provision of in-home food delivery.", "What has been helpful during the pandemic is getting some waivers so people could get food delivered.", "Imagine a single mom on WIC: on the public health side, we ask the mom to stay at home because of COVID-19, yet her children need access to food.", "We have had waivers approved by the federal government to be able to have delivery as well as pickup for some of our food programs.", "That also helps our economy in retail terms with the ability to make sales.", "In terms of food security, those programs run across our divisions but definitely work together.", "You might have one family that has a grandmother and a few young kids living with them, and they may qualify for multiple programs.", "We work across our divisions to organize that and make sure there are prompts for eligibility to any of the programs.", "Food security has become more of a focus.", "Food and housing are probably the two areas where people reach out with the greatest vulnerability.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 3, 2021 Concerning application and enrollment, there has been a gradual increase.", "In talking with people who enroll, their health care is not their primary need.", "If you think about it, they are likely not disabled; they had been working but then they were laid off.", "It is only when health care becomes a need that some of the folks who had been laid off have been enrolling, so that has been a gradual increase.", "We have seen more of a spike in applications for SNAP.", "I have illustrated some programs across divisions beyond health care, but I would call these all determinants of health\u2014poverty, housing, food security.", "We have also been enriched by our working relationship with the schools.", "I am so proud of our relationship with the Superintendent of Public Instruction.", "We have reached out to the school districts concerning how to meet some of the behavioral health challenges of kids who are being homeschooled and who might need additional help.", "The same goes for victims of crime and some of the services people need in that area.", "I venture to say that if it is a social service program, we have a touchpoint to it.", "In all these areas we look for parity of service.", "If we are underserving a population or if there is overrepresentation, it is helpful to be able to see what is going on and if we could go upstream and address the problem.", "In our state, we have a lot of food deserts.", "It may be one of the weaknesses in the United States Department of Agriculture programs such as SNAP that a liquor store can sell some groceries and qualify to be a SNAP provider, but that might be the only source for retail purchase of food in a neighborhood.", "I have identified that as an area we could improve on as relates to the food deserts.", "There are some models in WIC.", "For instance, in Chicago there are mobile WIC stores that go to neighborhoods.", "We have had some meetings with Catholic Charities about opportunities in that area.", "To come full circle, I want to again say food security probably is a pressing topic right now.", "Chair Nguyen: Thank you.", "I appreciate your ability to see some of the challenges we have had with this pandemic and that you are using the pandemic as an opportunity to streamline and cut through some of the bureaucratic red tape we have getting these services to the individuals who need them.", "I appreciate your willingness to be flexible and streamline the access to services and also your willingness to share this with us.", "Does anyone have any questions?", "I do not see any.", "Director Whitley is a resource, and contact information for the various divisions and agencies is available on NELIS as well, or our staff can get it to you.", "I will move on to public comment.", "As a reminder, you can always provide public comment in writing to the committee secretary.", "I think there is one person in the public comment queue.", "[There was no one.]", "Are there other comments from Committee members before we adjourn?", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 3, 2021 Assemblywoman Titus: Thank you for the presentation from Director Whitley.", "The institutional knowledge he has to offer concerning how we got to this point and what brought us here is quite valuable to all of us.", "I would encourage you to reach out to him.", "If he does not know the answer, someone in his Department will know.", "Getting the history so we do not have to repeat it concerning some of these programs that may or may not have worked is valuable.", "It is a big lift for the state of Nevada.", "The biggest budget item is health care, so we really need to understand where we send those monies, and Director Whitley is a great resource.", "Chair Nguyen: I completely agree.", "Are there any other comments or concerns?", "[There was no response.]", "That concludes our meeting for today.", "Our next meeting is Monday, February 8.", "Meeting adjourned [at 2:50 p.m.].", "Chair Nguyen: [Roll was taken.]", "Let us get started with our first presenter.", "We are going to take a deeper dive into some of the state agencies, so we will turn this over to the Division of Public and Behavioral Health in the Department of Health and Human Services.", "Lisa Sherych, Administrator, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services: Several of us will be sharing today's presentation [Exhibit C].", "Moving to our first slide [page 2, Exhibit C], this provides an overview of our division's vision and mission.", "The next slide [page 3] provides an overview of our division's organizational chart, and the subsequent slide [page 4] provides an overview of our agency's operations.", "As you can see, we are composed of five service branches\u2014community health, regulatory and planning, clinical, behavioral health policy, and administrative services.", "The next two slides [pages 5 and 6] provide an overview of our public health program, and the next three slides [pages 7-9] provide an overview of our division's accomplishments.", "Of note, I am particularly proud of the work the Division of Public and Behavioral Health has continued to do related to addressing COVID-19's spread within Nevada's licensed facilities.", "Comparing the national average of the percentage of deaths in facilities, Nevada has consistently been under 25 percent, whereas the approximate national average is 40 percent, with some states as high as 80 percent.", "Additionally, Nevada has been under 20 percent since August and, as of today, we are at 15.8 percent.", "That is 1.5 percent lower than it was a couple of weeks ago.", "The next slide [page 10] provides information on our division's public health priorities.", "Now I will turn it over to Julia Peek who will provide a further overview of our presentation.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 8, 2021 Julia Peek, Deputy Administrator, Community Health Services, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services: One of the easiest ways to understand public health is to understand the historical accomplishments in the field.", "I have provided a link in the PowerPoint of ten great public health achievements [page 11].", "I will note the top five which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes as: vaccination; motor vehicle safety; safer workplaces, which is related to safety in mining, manufacturing, and construction; control of infectious diseases, which includes clean water and sanitation; and decline in deaths from coronary heart disease and stroke.", "This centers around risk modification including smoking cessation, blood pressure control, early detection, and better treatment.", "The report goes on to list another five accomplishments that range from maternal and child health to other areas.", "I encourage anyone interested to access the link that has been provided.", "That said, even in this top five, you can see the great diversity in scope and responsibility of our public health partners.", "This next slide [page 12, Exhibit C] is a diagram we commonly use to show the public health system.", "It illustrates the diversity of our partnerships in place to address and improve the health of our residents.", "Depending on the issue at hand to tackle, the specific partners we work with can vary.", "For example, with COVID-19, there is not one partner on this diagram we have not worked with to address it in our state.", "Going to the next slide [page 13], as we talk again about the scope of public health, it is very broad and flexible in scope and responsibility because it relates to the health of our public generally.", "As a rule, our efforts are driven to understand why people get sick and why they die.", "Our overarching vision is for each person to live a long and healthy life.", "If we can understand the health issues in our population and subpopulations, we can try to intervene to prevent that negative outcome.", "We often find our focus is on infectious disease because it can spread quickly through the population.", "This next slide [page 14] is a model we use often in public health, and we can really speak about the issue as it relates to this.", "It is called a social-ecological model and it helps us understand the many levels of an issue, especially as it relates to population or public health.", "This model starts locally with the individual and then there are peers and family.", "It evolves to the highest level\u2014the influence of policy.", "This model helps us understand which level has an impact on the health issues so we can develop specific interventions at each of those levels.", "The next slide [page 15] shows an example concerning childhood obesity.", "With childhood obesity we look at the child.", "That child's personal demographics are a primary factor in the weight, but we also look at the parents' weight and food preferences in the home.", "The policy level, in that same scenario, is where the larger population efforts occur around childhood obesity, for example, seeing nutritional details on food items or on restaurant menus.", "Also, the taxing of certain items can change behavior.", "Those are all policy opportunities as we look at obesity and healthy living.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 8, 2021 I would like to speak about the amazing universities in our state, specifically, and nationwide as well.", "There is great diversity in the field of public health, and what you are seeing here is a list of the specialties or core competencies that our public health professionals can focus on [page 16].", "This is truly a holistic approach to addressing public health.", "Again, I want to acknowledge our universities in the state that have been such a pivotal part of our response to COVID-19.", "I am going to provide a highlight and a link on the next slide [page 17].", "Public health, like all topics, evolves over time.", "We are in a period of time coined \"Public Health 3.0.\"", "While public health professionals a century ago may have focused on very granular outbreaks or crises, now we function more as strategists to pull partners together to look at inequities and opportunities for intervention.", "In public health, we often get asked about our relationship with health care.", "It truly is a partnership.", "Health care focuses on the health of the individual patient.", "We focus on how all the patients together become population health, the health status of the collective group, and how to intervene.", "Public health is in constant evolution.", "With Public Health 3.0, we focus much more on collective impacts and reaching our residents where they are.", "We also understand more and focus on social determinants of health that lead to a particular health outcome.", "You will hear that a person's ZIP Code is often more a reflection of that person's health than that individual's genetic code.", "That is one of the things we look at as we delve into public health data.", "For example, you may have health insurance due to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, but you might not be getting preventative screening even though it is an allowable service.", "In public health, we try to understand why that is occurring.", "What is the barrier if it is no longer health insurance, and how can we help address any health issues a person might have and intervene?", "I am going to transition from global public health comments to concepts about public health in Nevada.", "Nevada is one of only two states nationally that has a largely decentralized public health structure.", "The bulk of our population is served by a district health department, but the state still provides direct service in many counties.", "We have also delegated some authority, for example, to Carson City Health and Human Services [page 20, Exhibit C].", "Going to the next slide [page 21], the structure and functions of public health are in several statutes, but I will highlight just two.", "Those are found in Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 439 and in NRS Chapter 441A.", "These have been of particular interest during the COVID-19 response.", "You will hear later from our two district health departments that function largely as independent health agencies, as well as from Carson City Health and Human Services, which operates as a regional health department under delegation of authority that is allowed in that law.", "The next slide [page 22] shows the county boards of health.", "In this case, I am focusing on our rural and frontier counties related to population size in the statute.", "Each county is Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 8, 2021 required to have a county board of health represented by the county commissioners, the sheriff, and a health officer.", "We work a great deal with the designated health officer.", "One of the challenges we had, as it relates to COVID-19, is that every rural county looked different.", "In some rural counties, there was a very functional board of health that was meeting on a regular basis and tackling population health issues locally.", "In some cases, there was no board of health.", "Trying to have that stood up and to identify a county health officer in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic was problematic.", "That said, the counties have moved mountains in this regard, and now that functional necessity of a public health system at the county level is incredible.", "I want to acknowledge all the efforts there.", "They have really stepped up.", "The next slide [page 23, Exhibit C] is a short list of what we have learned.", "In public health we have a wide variety of partners we work with when we address a specific issue, but one of the challenges is that we had to become the convener in many cases, not the doer.", "We had to work with our counties and county leadership, but specifically, we had to work with emergency management.", "That includes people locally including our National Guard and the Division of Emergency Management within the Department of Public Safety at the statewide level.", "They have really helped with the logistics\u2014to operationalize these incredible public health interventions.", "We also clearly identified a need for flexible funding to support a public health crisis in real time and support basic infrastructure.", "As you know, our federal partners did come through with funding for epidemiology, lab work capacity, immunization, public health preparedness, and other items, but we did function with what we had for several months in the beginning.", "With the exception of COVID-19 funding, we do not have the ability to address the need locally.", "We have many public health crises, but we do not have basic infrastructure funding.", "I also talked about decentralization of public health.", "Again, I cannot speak highly enough about how our rural and frontier counties stepped up.", "They had no infrastructure prior to the pandemic, but they accepted delegation of authority from our chief medical officer.", "They have shown such great work.", "I see great value in watering that effort and continuing to see it grow with other diseases outside of COVID-19.", "That will take some infrastructure funding so they can set up such structures.", "We try to get as much money as possible out into the field for direct service because the funds are so limited.", "As a result, as a division we skimp on our own funding for things such as human resources support, information technology (IT) infrastructure support, and fiscal support, because the need for direct service in our counties is so great; however, that creates a huge challenge for us.", "We received $430 million for the response to COVID-19, but as a division we need to get those subawards out and ensure that the spending is appropriate and correct, and that is a big ask.", "That has been a challenge for us.", "I want to acknowledge our IT staff because another huge challenge is that we had a very antiquated system for infectious disease, yet our lab reporting rose 8,000 times above what we were used to, which really crippled our system.", "In some cases, we were largely functioning on faxed reports, and that quickly became unmanageable.", "We have had to use some of the funding to develop things within our public health infrastructure that will have an impact on all diseases going forward.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 8, 2021 Another major challenge we had was the expectation that we could release data in a day.", "Related to public health, it is not typically real-time surveillance, so we were really challenged.", "With HIV data, for example, we take a year and a half to clean it before we release it to make sure it is the most accurate record on file.", "Those are things that were reasonable expectations of our community and of people who needed that information, and it has been an incredible lift on behalf of the public health structure.", "The last slide is related to public health funding [page 24].", "Each biennium, we report where public health spending in Nevada is ranked nationally.", "According to the America's Health Rankings, we are the least healthy state as far as public health funding is concerned.", "Alaska is the best at $289 per capita, and Nevada is at $50 per capita.", "That said, we have had investments in the past several years related to family planning, women's health connection, and other services, but we are still much further behind than many other states.", "One report shows that an investment of $10 per person in evidence-based programs can save the country $16 billion annually within five years.", "An important point is who benefits most from public health, and it is children, infants, and underresourced communities.", "A huge ask of us is to identify inequity and disparities and offer suggestions as to how we can intervene and ensure they are removed.", "That concludes the Division of Public and Behavioral Health's presentation.", "Chair Nguyen: Some of those numbers were quite impressive.", "I like to make a point of highlighting when our state is a leader nationally.", "Specifically, you mentioned that our numbers were about half in the long-term care facilities.", "I believe you said we were at 20 percent and even lower more recently.", "Can you highlight what we are doing right, and are we sharing these best management practices with other state agencies and other regulatory responders?", "Lisa Sherych: Early on we created what are essentially strike teams.", "We have always had an Office of Public Health Investigations and Epidemiology.", "We also have our Health Protection and Preparedness team and our Health Care Quality and Compliance team.", "Early on we made a concerted effort to make sure those three teams were working very closely together along with the facilities to identify infection control issues and provide a lot of technical assistance.", "We are coming from the angle of improving a situation rather than taking punitive actions.", "We have also done work with the Department of Corrections.", "Our staff has been out to a couple of those facilities and has provided information on how they can address certain infectious disease control issues.", "I do not have any information concerning sharing with other states, but I will check and provide that information later.", "Julia Peek: Ms. Sherych mentioned the health facility epidemiology team.", "That is something unique to Nevada.", "We learn from our crises in public health and we developed that team as a result of the hepatitis C outbreak in Clark County.", "We knew we had to have a strike team that could intervene immediately.", "We had that relationship and structure built prior to COVID-19, so Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 8, 2021 we were able to make minor modifications to that.", "Other states that had not worked so directly with epidemiology and health care-associated infections had to build that from scratch.", "That is something we are really proud of.", "The other thing we learned as a result of COVID-19 is that we were on separate reporting systems at the districts and the state.", "Now we are all going to move to the same infectious disease reporting system so we have a standardized way to collect data.", "We understand that county lines are not solid, and we need to be able to see how people go across the state, especially with infectious diseases.", "We are learning a lot and making foundational public health improvements.", "I will note that for COVID-19 vaccination, we have the highest administration rate in our region, so we are talking with our regional partners, telling them what we are doing, and offering suggestions concerning what is working and what is not.", "With this crisis, we are a leader in the region.", "Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: Are you collecting demographic information on COVID-19 rates?", "How is Nevada looking as compared to national rates of COVID-19 infection and deaths in the black communities in our state?", "I hope we are collecting that data and that you can report that information.", "Julia Peek: We are collecting information on race and ethnicity.", "We also are one of the only states that added questions related to LGBTQI issues.", "We will not know of disparities until we look at the data and see if there is truly a disparity in any areas.", "I think we are pretty standard, and I am happy to pull that data for you directly.", "I would like to explain some of the challenges with public health data in this capacity.", "We get that data from lab reports, so the cases you see on the Nevada Health Response dashboard are because we needed it in real time so we could see what was happening with the disease; however, lab reports required by our federal partners now often do not have race or ethnicity, so we were going off a lot of data that was unknown and trying to investigate those cases so we could get that information added.", "It is a huge effort.", "I hope our laboratory partners continue to improve in those areas because we need to know what the inequities look like in our community.", "We are also collecting that information related to vaccinations.", "The Governor has reported that he is going to focus on equity as we move forward.", "A challenge we experience with equity is that it is self-reported.", "Sometimes people are uncomfortable sharing that information, so we have to communicate effectively about why we collect that data and how we are going to use that data.", "We are doing a lot of effort in that regard right now, but across the board, Nevada is trying to be as progressive as possible in asking as many questions across all the pieces in the hope that we can find inequities of race, ethnicity, and otherwise, and then address them.", "Chair Nguyen: If you can provide any of that data to our committee secretary, we will distribute it to the rest of the Committee.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 8, 2021 Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: Can you tell me, as a representative for my community, what can those of us who are elected officials do to help improve the confidence among our community members to report this data to you so you can have better data to report and collect?", "What can we do to help?", "Julia Peek: You truly are the champions in the community.", "What you say will be heard.", "For our part in public health, we will make an effort to get you the talking points and information you need to then go champion that back to your community.", "I will send information to you all, specifically around vaccinations, but also concerning the importance, in any disease and investigation, of providing that information to the public health partners and understanding that it is confidential.", "It is used by us to bring resources to the community and identify if there are disparities.", "I am happy to get you some talking points to share with your community.", "Assemblywoman Titus: Thank you to all of you who are presenting today, for what you are doing for the public health of Nevada.", "I know these are challenging times, and it would have been challenging without a pandemic.", "Recently in the news there has been information about disparity concerning the vaccines and who has been receiving them.", "In the money committee, I have discussed receiving COVID-19 funds, where they are going, and making sure we have that outreach and trust.", "Our Attorney General made a big point when he got his vaccine because he wanted the communities to be reassured that it is okay to get the vaccine.", "As we know, there is a huge amount of distrust in the process and, frankly, rightfully so.", "My concern is that there is significant disparity about who has gotten this vaccine.", "Is it because you were following what the Office of the Governor set up concerning different lanes and tiers?", "In the first tier were first responders, then people over the age of 70 were in the second tier, and there were those kinds of criteria.", "How was it decided to give those vaccinations?", "You were just following the tiers as directed, but has that changed at all, now we know that may not have been good enough?", "Julia Peek: Regarding funding, the disparities and inequities have been something our federal partners have been emphasizing since the start of the pandemic, and those are reflected in the data we have as well.", "Related to the vaccination grant, at least 10 percent of that award has to go directly to addressing disparity in the community and equitable distribution.", "That includes racial and ethnic disparity, but also rural residents were specifically called out.", "Those are things each of our local health departments will build into their budgets as they spend that award.", "There is also an equity task force that is a requirement of that award.", "In Nevada, we are one of the states that developed staffing within the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Minority Health and Equity from the beginning of the COVID-19 Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 8, 2021 response, which has been working with us on testing, how we message that appropriately, and now on vaccination as well, as has our coalition.", "We will continue to work in that area.", "Related to the playbook, that is such an important discussion and point.", "If we looked at straight population distribution, then we would look at the folks within a certain ZIP Code getting the level that is appropriate, based on their overall piece of the population.", "As you mentioned, that is not how this works; it is related to lanes or tiers.", "It has been called different things, but we based our playbook and our recommendations on the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations and what our CDC partners said.", "It might look like there is inequity in certain ZIP Codes or age groups, but it is a result of following the playbook.", "Anything we present can be improved on, so it is a matter of drawing more attention to it and ensuring that we have data collected.", "This goes back to how important it is to share accurate information with the person vaccinating you on address, race, ethnicity, et cetera, so when we pull the data, especially when it becomes more general population-based, that we can ensure there is a level of equity.", "The other thing we are doing is looking at how we reach populations that might have a hard time getting vaccinated, so we will be looking at mobile outreach.", "You have seen it before with the Mammovan\u2014where we can go to a community and vaccinate or test that community with that mobile resource.", "It will be particularly helpful to target specific ZIP Codes when we eventually get a one-dose vaccine for COVID-19 like the Johnson & Johnson.", "Again, that is most important when it becomes a general-population vaccination.", "We are working again with equity across the 70-plus-year-olds.", "The biggest challenge is the supply issue at this point.", "We have a limited number of vaccinations, so it is challenging for folks to get the resource.", "Something we have done to implement equity and address barriers presented is develop the call line.", "Though not perfect, it is getting a huge number of calls.", "We are walking people through how to sign up, so if you do not have a smart device or you are having a hard time navigating the website or the various pharmacy websites for enrollment, you can call our helpline and we will walk you through.", "We are not perfect by any means, but we are certainly trying to get better eyes on it and better data so we ensure equity at every level we have control over.", "Assemblywoman Titus: To follow up on that, could you get us some numbers?", "Not just on the COVID-19 vaccine, because as you said, this is a unique situation and we developed the best plan we could.", "As you said, it may not be perfect, but there have been some real disparities in getting vaccines in general.", "We will get control of this pandemic, but we may not necessarily get control of the need to reach out and get more people vaccinated, and not just with the COVID-19 vaccine, but with the flu vaccine.", "We are at the bottom as related to numbers of folks who actually get vaccinated for the flu.", "I think only 44 percent of our population gets the flu vaccine, so this goes far beyond COVID-19.", "What COVID-19 has done is show us the holes in our system and bring them to the forefront.", "If we could see some data on what the traditional vaccination rates are across the board for all vaccines available and how we need Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 8, 2021 to do better for all members of our Nevada communities, that would be helpful.", "We are still lacking on some of these vaccines that need to be given or that people should consider getting.", "Hopefully, when we get some of this data you say you are now gathering, we will get information about the disparity rates in overall vaccines and who is getting them.", "Chair Nguyen: If Committee members have further questions, I would ask you to reach out directly to our presenters, and we can get you their contact information.", "The next presentation is from Carson City Health and Human Services.", "Nicki Aaker, Director, Carson City Health and Human Services: We have a county board of health.", "Carson City's municipal code, as relates to our board of health, requires a Nevada-licensed doctor, whereas NRS Chapter 439 does not.", "Carson City elected to create its county board of health in 2003.", "The board of health's composition includes a county health officer, the Carson City board of supervisors, and the sheriff.", "[page 28, Exhibit C].", "We are a local health authority, not a district, since Carson City is a consolidated municipality.", "To be a district, two or more counties or cities need to join together.", "It is a city department within Carson City.", "Our department received public health accreditation in May 2016 after many years spent working on that endeavor.", "The core documents of accreditation are the community health needs assessment, the community health improvement plan, and the strategic plan.", "Some other important plans include the quality improvement plan, workforce development plan, risk communications plan, and the public health emergency operations plan.", "Right now, we are in the midst of going through reaccreditation.", "Staffing at the health department

currently higher due to the COVID-19 grants we received.", "There is also 8 percent from revenue received.", "The revenue includes an interlocal agreement.", "One of our divisions is chronic disease prevention and health promotion.", "The adolescent health program conducts abstinence and comprehensive sexual health classes for youth and families-talking-together classes that teach parents how they can talk to their children about sex.", "Staff have been researching creative ways to conduct classes since schools are not allowing outsiders in due to COVID-19, although some of the alternative schools for troubled youth have allowed our instructors to teach in person.", "We also have a Ryan White Retention in Care Program that attempts to find individuals who are out of care and have been diagnosed with HIV, determines what their barriers are, and helps get them back into care.", "This is mainly focused on the rural and frontier counties.", "We have our Tobacco Control and Prevention Program that focuses on providing educational Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 8, 2021 presentations to the youth, discouraging initiation of the use of tobacco products and

staffing for the chronic disease prevention and health promotion division is 4.5 FTEs and this division is 100 percent grant-funded.", "We also have clinical services, and the services we provide are listed [page 33, Exhibit C].", "We receive Title X funding directly from the federal government and we subgrant some of that funding to Douglas County.", "We receive other funding from the state either as pass-through grants or from state funding.", "Currently the clinic is seeing patients and we are taking measures to protect the staff and the clients from COVID-19.", "The staffing in that division is 10 FTEs and that division is 9 percent general-funded, 61 percent grant funded, and 30 percent revenue.", "We bill different insurances and we also collect cash payments on a sliding scale for services provided to those who are uninsured or who do not wish to use their insurance.", "Another division is disease control and prevention which consists of environmental health and epidemiology.", "Speaking about the environmental-health side of the division, I have listed the establishments that our health inspectors inspect and permit [pages 35 and 36].", "We provide environmental health services to Douglas County through an interlocal agreement.", "Other duties are also listed here; please note that a couple of the duties are only in Carson City.", "Staffing

the future.", "Our epidemiology program is very involved in COVID-19 contact tracing and reporting [page 37].", "Along with COVID-19, there continue to be other reportable diseases that need to be investigated.", "Currently we have 1.5 FTEs working on those other diseases.", "Staffing for this entire program currently is 16.5 FTEs.", "Prior to COVID-19 it was 2 FTEs.", "We also have some

next person on our list is Mr. Kevin Dick.", "Kevin Dick, District Health Officer, Washoe County Health District: The Washoe County Health District was established under NRS Chapter 439 under the

construction of those.", "We are unique in Nevada in that we provide air quality management programs [page 54].", "Under state statute, the health district is designated to implement the federal Clean Air Act in Washoe County.", "We have a network of monitoring stations and we put out daily air quality information and alerts as necessary.", "We have a planning area where we work to try to prevent deterioration of our air quality in Washoe County, so we have a woodstove program that addresses use of certified clean-burning stoves and the issuing of burn codes when we have inversions.", "We also have a smog check program and programs to address ozone precursors coming from vehicles.", "Our permitting program addresses stationary air pollution sources, surface disturbances for dust control,

an accredited health district.", "We received our national accreditation in 2019, and we work with the other divisions across the health district to maintain that accreditation status.", "We do health assessments, and through those we work with our partners to identify how to work together as a community to improve the priority areas we identified in the assessments.", "Currently we are focusing on areas of housing and homelessness, behavioral health, and physical activity and nutrition with a number of community partners, with a plan for moving forward which we have been implementing over the past few years.", "We lead our quality improvement and workforce development efforts as well as our communications.", "I want to also acknowledge our government affairs liaison, Joelle Dodson.", "You may see her presenting testimony, public comment, or communicating with you during the session.", "This is our $24 million budget for 2021 without the additional funding we have received for COVID-19 [page 56, Exhibit C].", "Our largest funding comes from the general fund transfer from Washoe County and is about 40 percent of our budget.", "Under statute, we are also able to charge fees for services such as permitting and other regulatory oversight activities.", "We collect revenue from the sale of tires in Nevada that supports some of our solid waste management efforts.", "Our air quality program is supported through a $1 fee on the smog certificates issued in Washoe County.", "The federal and state grants that compose just over 25 percent of our budget are mostly federal funding that is either direct or passed through the state.", "As was mentioned, Nevada has a very low state investment in public health, and so we receive 1.8 percent of our budget from state funding through grants.", "We have received an additional $16.8 million in federal funds for the COVID-19 response in addition to our $24 million budget, so you can see that is a significant additional source of funding.", "Here is a quick overview of our COVID-19 response [page 57].", "We activated our department's incident command system on January 17, 2020.", "Our first case occurred on March 5, and

here some historic photos that span our premask days and our mask days and response.", "Since the pandemic started, we stood up a drive-through COVID-19 testing operation that we had operational within one-and-a-half days of having our first case identified in Washoe County on March 5.", "We have learned from and improved that operation since that day and have expanded it dramatically.", "We are now using that same facility for our COVID-19 vaccination point of dispensing (POD).", "We set a new record last Friday with 1,800 people vaccinated.", "We stood up a COVID-19 call center, and we now have 24 people dedicated to staffing that.", "The call center does the scheduling for testing as well as for administering the vaccines.", "It provides for reporting of test results and does an incredible amount of data entry Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 8, 2021 work on the backside of providing those vaccines, to get that information into the data management

minimum wage.", "They are not able to work remotely; they do not have paid sick leave; and they often live in close quarters with other family members.", "As a result, we have seen a disproportionate impact within our Hispanic community throughout this pandemic.", "We also need to understand that the data on testing show that the Hispanic population is being tested in disproportionately low numbers relative to their population in Nevada, so these numbers may not be reliable [page 59, Exhibit C].", "We have also seen a devastating impact on our elderly population with the number of deaths occurring in that segment of our population.", "Fortunately, we are trending better with the number of cases we are experiencing in our community.", "While this figure is from last week, as of yesterday, our seven-day moving average for new cases in Washoe County is down to 90 and our positivity rate has declined to 11.1 percent [page 60].", "Not so long ago, the positivity rate was 22 percent, so we are grateful to see this.", "We are not out of the woods yet; we want to continue to see these numbers decrease, but we think we are seeing good outcomes with everyone working together, the mitigation measures, and the pause the Governor instituted.", "Sadly, 616 deaths have been reported in Washoe County to date.", "When we were surging here in Washoe County, it was very frightening.", "Our health system was under great stress, and we were seriously looking at the possibility that we would need to ration medical care, so I am very relieved to see these numbers going down as they are.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 8, 2021 This is a picture on December 15 of our first shipment of Pfizer vaccine arriving at the health district [page

little about treating and testing our homeless population, managing care for them, housing them in facilities that are accommodating their needs, and how you are balancing that.", "Kevin Dick: We are working closely with the human services agency and our other regional partners regarding the homeless population.", "Some of the first pictures you saw relating to COVID-19 were photos of testing we were doing at the Reno Events Center.", "We utilized that facility so we could provide additional distancing for the shelter population because there was limited space at the Record Street community assistance center.", "The county also has been able to stand up new facilities for women and families at the Northern Nevada Adult Mental Health Services campus so that is providing additional capacity there.", "A men's shelter has been established on Fourth Street to increase the population that can be housed there.", "A positive result of this has been the work done together across the region on plans for a larger area for the homeless\u2014a campus and complex, an area called the Governor's Bowl.", "For people who are homeless and who have tested positive for COVID-19, we have a contract regionally with WellCare.", "They are able to accept those people who do not require hospital-level care and provide them with support services and housing during their isolation period.",

would be really good to see that information.", "Can you follow up with staff on that?", "Kevin Dick: I can follow up on that.", "Chair Nguyen: Are there any other questions?", "[There was no response.]", "I will now move to our last presentation of the day, the Southern Nevada Health District.", "Fermin Leguen, District Health Officer, Southern Nevada Health District: In southern Nevada, we have our board of health and there are 11 members of the board with representation from different cities and the county [page 70, Exhibit C].", "We now have more than 680 employees, which is significant growth from our previous numbers.", "About two years ago, there were fewer than 500 employees here.", "There are five divisions in our health district, among them community health, environmental health, critical services, administration, and a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC), which is a new development within the health district.", "We received an award from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in September 2019, and we were able to start the FQHC operations.", "Recently we received a second award from HRSA that allowed our operation for the next three years.", "Right now, we are still developing our health center, but it is fully functional.", "We have a similar administration as the ones presented by our colleagues, so I will not present an organizational chart or how the divisions operate.", "Those are very common among the health districts.", "I just want to emphasize some of the areas where we have a different approach.", "For example, two years ago we started offering a preventive medicine program.", "That is something that was created because there is a need for preventive medicine physicians in Nevada, and we saw the opportunity to really contribute to that effort.", "That is a partnership between us and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV).", "The residents spend the first year doing their master of public health programs at the university and then, the second year, they do their clinical and management rotations here with us at the health district.", "We also have been working on other projects regarding opioid reduction.", "We received a grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for overdose data collection with the engagement of surveillance and preventive action for a drug overdose.", "This was our budget at the beginning of the fiscal year beginning on July 1 [page 72].", "It was $98 million.", "Our current budget is $139 million.", "Because of COVID-19, we received almost $32-$33 million from the CDC to support our enhanced surveillance activities, contact tracing, and testing.", "The federal grant represents about 22 percent of our budget, so it is a Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 8, 2021 little bit different from what the slide shows because there was almost a 30 percent increase in our budget because of COVID-19 activities.", "We do have concerns about our budget for this coming fiscal year because our budget normally receives between 25 and 28 percent from local property taxes, and our expectation is that those taxes might decrease next year.", "That would have a negative impact in our activities, so this is something we have been talking with the county about, and we also are trying to prepare for that for next year.", "This is a picture of our dashboard and it is available online [page 73].", "This is the site where we share information with our community and anyone in the country who has an interest in our data.", "We have here the current number of cases that have been reported in Clark County, hospitalizations, and also the number of deaths.", "In the main menu of the dashboard there are seven areas where people can click and get additional information.", "We have data by ZIP Code and mapping.", "Also, under the \"Characteristics\" tab, people can look at trends.", "The last thing we incorporated into our dashboard was the place of possible exposure.", "There we share with the community the areas that our cases report as being visited within the previous 14 days.", "That is something we utilize with our environmental health division.", "We have that information in conjunction with additional data we receive from our patients.", "Then, of course, there is the trend of the pandemic in Clark County from last year until now.", "For the last few weeks, we have seen a very big decrease in the number of cases.", "We hope it continues that way.", "This is the incidence of COVID-19 in Clark County by race/ethnicity [page 74, Exhibit C].", "Since the beginning of this pandemic, in Clark County we have seen that the Hispanic population has been the one with the largest impact in terms of cases.", "This has been very consistent throughout the pandemic.", "With the Hispanic population in Clark County, this high incidence they are experiencing actually does not appear to translate to mortality.", "The reported mortality for Hispanics in Clark County is the lowest among the different racial and ethnic groups.", "This is our ZIP Code map, and this is something we use in addition to the community one for the whole pandemic [page 75].", "For this one, we use more recent data\u2014the last 14 days\u2014so that helps identify new areas that could be affected by the pandemic.", "What you see here is that most of our high-incidence areas are in the central part of the county.", "Those areas belong more to the City of Las Vegas and the City of North Las Vegas.", "What you see to the right is the east area of Las Vegas: ZIP Codes 89110, 89142, and the others.", "Those are the areas where we consistently have seen the largest impact of the pandemic.", "These areas also are highly populated by members of the Hispanic community as well.", "This is the first day the vaccine arrived in Clark County [page 76].", "It was December 14, and we distributed the vaccine immediately, as soon as we received it.", "Actually, that very first day, we had a POD at one of our local hospitals and then we continued distributing the vaccine through the valley during that week.", "I also want to mention that for the vaccination campaign we have developed a very strong partnership with the county and local jurisdictions and also with local universities: Touro Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 8, 2021 University Nevada, UNLV, Roseman University of Health Sciences, the College of Southern Nevada, and other institutions.", "All of them are participating in the pandemic whether it is supporting PODs or providing staff to participate in our operations.", "We also have met with representatives of churches in the valley, the business community, and representatives of the Hispanic and African American communities as well.", "We also have communications and presentations with the Asian community through the Filipino nursing association and their partners.", "At this point in Clark County, we have administered more than 200,000 doses\u2014until yesterday, it was 214,000 doses.", "Those were distributed all over the county.", "We have big vaccination sites at Cashman Center, and we offer vaccinations at Western High School, at Jerome Mack Middle School on the east side of the city, and at Eldorado High School.", "Recently we opened the Las Vegas Convention Center to offer second-dose vaccinations.", "I also wanted to share with you some data regarding the vaccine here.", "Fifty-eight percent of the people who received the vaccine are females.", "That might be because of the weight of health care workers in this population.", "Health care workers at this point represent more than 40 percent of the individuals who have been vaccinated in Clark County.", "Also, in terms of race and ethnicity, 41 percent are white, 10 percent Asian, 10 percent Hispanic, 6 percent African American, and about 30 percent of the individuals are either \"other\" or \"unknown,\" complicating the issue of race/ethnicity analysis, but it is important to know that.", "In terms of who administered the vaccine, 64,000 doses have been administered by hospitals, representing more than 30 percent of both doses; 58 percent has been administered by the health district at Cashman Center.", "This is a ZIP Code map showing the distribution of doses in Clark County [page 79, Exhibit C].", "What we want to highlight here is that until last week, the numbers in Clark County of vaccine distributed did not match what was happening with the incidence of COVID-19 in Clark County [page 80].", "To the left is the incidence-by-ZIP-Code map.", "To the right is the vaccine-administered map.", "The vaccine-administered map does not match geographically the incidence-by-ZIP-Code map.", "As you probably are aware, there were recent comments or declarations about health inequality in Clark County and the way that we distribute the vaccine.", "I believe those were unfair because until now, more than 40 percent of the vaccines have been distributed to health care workers.", "Also, we have issues with the race/ethnicity analysis in terms of the weight of the unknown and other groups.", "Having said that, we do have a plan on how to address the health inequalities in Clark County.", "In addition to the large vaccination sites that we have and are planning for in the future, we will be targeting some communities with smaller teams and PODs in collaboration with elected officials and representatives of community-based organizations and churches in those areas.", "When we offer the vaccine at those sites, most of the population who receive the vaccine will be the ones who actually live in the area.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 8, 2021 This issue is important to mention.", "I was reading an article in The New York Times recently that mentioned health inequalities in this country.", "An example was given of some large metropolitan areas deploying large vaccination sites mostly in affluent areas because it was easier to do that.", "This is not the case in Clark County.", "Our PODs are all within the areas where we have more cases; Cashman Center is just in the middle of all that action, as are all those schools where we have opened PODs.", "Those large vaccination PODs do not allow for that kind of control, and that is why we emphasize a small operation when it comes to health inequality.", "The thing is that the vaccination is open to everybody, and we want everybody to receive it.", "Chair Nguyen: Do you have any kind of breakdown by Assembly districts of COVID-19 positivity and vaccination rates that you might be able to provide the Committee with, even if it is only by ZIP Code?", "That question is also for our previous presenters if they are still on the line.", "Fermin Leguen: Yes, I will ask our data people because that most likely will require census tracts; ZIP Codes are very unlikely to match the area.", "Chair Nguyen: Thank you for your presentation.", "A lot of times people did not know exactly what the health districts did or what they are responsible for.", "Now we have a pandemic that they are responsible for, and we appreciate all the challenges and the unique and creative responses your agencies are trying to accommodate and thrive in this situation.", "With that, I will close the presentation.", "Do we have anyone for public comment?", "[There was no one.]", "Wednesday's agenda includes an overview of mental health in Nevada.", "In addition, we will hear from the Division of Public and Behavioral Health within the Department of Health and Human Services.", "These are important topics for us to know about as a Committee going forward with some of the bills we will be seeing.", "We will also have presentations from the regional behavioral health policy boards.", "I will ask everyone to come prepared for the two bills we will be hearing.", "The first is Assembly Bill 62.", "If you want to obtain more information about the Nevada ABLE Savings Program which was addressed last session, I will have links sent to you.", "Our first bill draft, Assembly Joint Resolution 1 from Assemblywoman Titus, will also be presented.", "Again, reach out to our policy analyst or our legal counsel if you have any questions while reviewing those bills.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 8, 2021 Are there any comments or questions from Committee members?", "[There was no response.]", "Meeting adjourned [at 3:56 p.m.].", "Chair Nguyen: [Roll was taken.]", "I would like to welcome our audience joining us either virtually on the legislative website or on YouTube.", "Today, we have presentations on mental health in Nevada and hearings on two bills.", "Before we begin, I would like to make several housekeeping announcements.", "Agenda items may be taken in a different order than listed.", "Two or more agenda items may be combined for consideration, an item may be removed from the agenda, or discussion of an item may be delayed at any time.", "This virtual meeting format via Zoom is important to keep everyone safe during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "Members of the public may provide testimony in several different ways, all of which are listed on the agenda.", "Right now, you can register to participate online through the Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 10, 2021 Legislature's website on the Nevada Electronic Legislative Information System (NELIS) or by sending your comments directly to our staff.", "Any committee exhibits may be submitted electronically.", "Our members can see them online, as well as the public, and we try our best to keep those up to date so you can have access to them before our meetings.", "If you are not able to submit public comment over the telephone, at the end of the meeting, or during the bill presentations today, you will be able to do so in writing up to 48 hours after our meeting adjournment.", "We will now begin our first agenda item.", "There will be an opportunity for limited comments or questions from Committee members, but our policy analyst will send out our presenters' contact information; so if you are not able to ask your questions today under these limited circumstances, I encourage you to reach out to them.", "They have been very forthcoming with information when I have needed it, as I am sure they will be with you.", "Now I would like to start off with our first presentation from the Department of Health and Human Services.", "Stephanie Woodard, Senior Advisor on Behavioral Health, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services: We are here today to provide a brief overview of the State of Nevada's behavioral health system and to discuss the impacts of COVID-19 on behavioral health in Nevada and opportunities for behavioral health going forward [Exhibit C].", "This presentation is intended to be very high-level as an introduction to the state system; we recognize from the outset that the behavioral health system is vast and incredibly complex.", "We are not going to be able to go into much detail here; however, both Dr. Megan Freeman and I are available for questions following this presentation as well as offline if there are any specific issues or topics you would like to learn more about.", "There are lots of different departments and divisions within the State of Nevada that have touchpoints to behavioral health and play critical roles in ensuring that services and supports are provided within other systems such as criminal justice [page 2].", "But the Division of Public and Behavioral Health (DPBH), the Division of Child and Family Services (DCFS), and the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy all function together under the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to provide essential elements for the statewide, community-based, behavioral health system.", "Behavioral health in Nevada has evolved over the past decade, especially with implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.", "These state-driven systems have helped to expand access to care when previously the state itself was the largest behavioral health provider in Nevada.", "This evolution has required a concerted effort and coordination across divisions within DHHS, and DPBH serves as the state mental health authority and the single state authority for substance abuse treatment and prevention.", "Collectively, the three divisions work together to plan, regulate, and provide oversight, training and technical assistance, and financing to this complex system.", "In order for us to do the planning and oversight we provide to the state behavioral health system, we have several boards and commissions that help guide our work [page 3].", "These include the State Board of Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 10, 2021 Health, the regional behavioral health policy boards, the Behavioral Health Planning and Advisory Council, and the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Agency Advisory Board.", "Collectively, these have, in one way or another, an opportunity to provide planning, oversight, regulation, and advocacy for behavioral health in Nevada.", "The DPBH has several priorities moving into this biennium, and they include things like evidence-based forensic services, improved behavioral health through promotion, prevention, early intervention, and access to quality behavioral health services, and continuing to improve inter- and intra-agency communication and collaboration [page 4, Exhibit C].", "This is a brief summary of what the behavioral health system looks like in Nevada, specifically as it relates to DPBH.", "As the state mental health authority, we have direct services in both civil and forensic.", "We also provide a high level of policy advisement, and we manage a number of federal and state grants that are often passed through to community programs to assist in prevention programming as well as to support community behavioral health providers to establish new programs.", "We work with those programs toward sustainability, and we use some of the funding to help provide services for individuals who are uninsured or underinsured [pages 5-7].", "The behavioral health system also includes the Bureau of Health Care Quality and Compliance.", "They often assist with the licensure of health care facilities including some of the foundational facilities that are part of the behavioral health system in Nevada.", "Then we have administrative services which are absolutely essential for us to be able to administer the grant funds we receive.", "For our clinical services on the civil side we have two inpatient psychiatric hospitals, one each in Washoe and Clark Counties [pages 8 and 9].", "The access to inpatient services usually is for an individual who is admitted under an emergency through a mental health crisis; however, they do also have voluntary admissions.", "There are also several outpatient clinics that make up a network of care within our state.", "There are four of these clinics in urban areas\u2014three in Clark County and one in Washoe County\u2014as well as eighteen community-based clinics throughout rural Nevada.", "Access to outpatient services is completely voluntary unless the individual has been ordered to mental health court or to assisted outpatient treatment.", "It is important to note that our civil service outpatient programs really do provide the safety net services for individuals in Nevada who are uninsured or underinsured.", "They also work very closely in collaboration with community partners to provide a no-wrong-door approach on the campuses of both the Northern Nevada Adult Mental Health Services\u2014Dini-Townsend Hospital\u2014and the Southern Nevada Adult Mental Health Services.", "But they also provide coordination of care with many community-based programs.", "In addition to the community-based programs they work in, they also provide an array of services related to outpatient mental health services.", "On the forensic side, we have two hospitals in Nevada\u2014Lakes Crossing Center in Sparks and the Stein Hospital forensic facility in southern Nevada [pages 10-12].", "These two hospitals care for individuals who are working toward restoration of competency.", "They have long-term inpatient forensic programs for individuals who are committed to the division, and Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 10, 2021 they are serving individuals who were acquitted as not guilty by reason of insanity.", "These forensic hospitals have been working very hard over the last several years to assist in addressing the federal consent decree around the inability of the state's single forensic hospital to admit all court-ordered referrals in a timely manner.", "They have recently been able to move out of the consent decree, but it is important to acknowledge that the forensic hospitals remain at or near full capacity.", "Although the consent decree has expired without penalties or further oversight, the state is continuously focused on careful management in order to meet demand and avoid any other legal challenges.", "Those are the two areas where there are direct clinical services that are provided within the Division of Public and Behavioral Health on both the civil and forensic side, but as we have worked to move away from being the largest behavioral health provider in Nevada and to build capacity at the community level, we have recognized the need for additional support to help build that community capacity.", "The behavioral health policy unit works to administer the majority of our large federal funding streams that are used to address specific populations, including those who are uninsured and underinsured [page 13, Exhibit C].", "This also requires the policy division to work on additional supports such as technical assistance, strategic planning, and implementation of systems within the state and in communities.", "Some of the behavioral health policy areas of focus include addressing minority health inequity and disparities and supporting evidence-based practices.", "After COVID-19, we did a lot to help support community agencies to fully implement telehealth and to focus on suicide prevention and crisis services.", "That is my very brief overview of the behavioral health system as it relates to the Division of Public and Behavioral Health, and now I will hand this presentation over to Dr. Megan Freeman at the Division of Child and Family Services to provide a similar overview of their system.", "Megan Freeman, Clinical and Policy Advisor on Children's Behavioral Health, Division of Child and Family Services, Department of Health and Human Services: Thank you for the opportunity to present to you on children's mental health [Exhibit D].", "Today I would like to give you an overview of our agency operations and explain how our work shapes the children's mental health system in Nevada.", "On this slide [page 3], you will see our agency vision and mission.", "In trying to improve conditions for youth in every Nevada community, we seek to break down barriers to access to care in every region across the state, to eliminate disproportionality in our systems, and to meet the needs of special populations.", "In addition to our agency vision and mission, three regional children's mental health consortia guide the growth and development of our children's mental health system.", "The makeup and roles of the children's mental health consortia are defined in Nevada Revised Statutes, and the consortia chairs and I will speak to this Committee on February 15 in more detail about this [page 4].", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 10, 2021 Next, I would like to touch on another important value system that guides our work.", "Nearly 30 years ago, a federal initiative known as the Children's Mental Health Initiative was authorized to facilitate the delivery of comprehensive community mental health services to children and youth.", "Through this initiative, hundreds of demonstration grants, cooperative agreements, and expansion grants have been funded throughout the United States to encourage the widespread adoption of what is called the \"system of care\" approach.", "The Division of Child and Family Services (DCFS) has received three grants under the Children's Mental Health Initiative and is committed to the system of care (SOC) approach.", "The core values of an SOC approach include providing services and creating systems that are family-driven and youth-guided.", "The services are community-based, accessible, and provided in the least restrictive environment, and services and systems are culturally and linguistically appropriate [page 5, Exhibit D].", "The Division of Child and Family Services' operations are divided into four separate areas, which you can see here [page 6].", "In 2019, DCFS underwent an internal reorganization to move away from our traditional orientation around children's mental health, child welfare, and juvenile justice services.", "This resulted in new coordination of our services around community-based services, residential or 24-hour services, and quality and oversight.", "Since the reorganization, we have been working to break down silos, incorporate children's mental health programming throughout the child and family services system, and

outpatient, mobile, and other community-based services including child protective and welfare services for rural Nevada.", "We offer services for ages 0 to 17, or into the early 20s if the youth is still enrolled in K-12 school.", "We primarily serve Medicaid fee-for-service, uninsured, underinsured, and undocumented families.", "For some programs such as our mobile crisis response team, we serve any family in need at no cost.", "The focus of our residential services programs is 24-hour care.", "This includes acute care, residential treatment, and juvenile justice youth facilities.", "Our youth facilities are focused on programming and not on punishment.", "Per policy, every youth receives an assessment for mental health and substance-use treatment needs, and treatment is provided as needed.", "Our youth facilities also operate under a recently modernized suicide prevention policy.", "Our quality and oversight area is focused on policy, quality assurance, and DCFS in its oversight/regulatory role as a state agency.", "Additionally, our systems advocate is located in the quality and oversight area.", "This position functions as our public information officer and legislative liaison.", "Division of Child and Family Services administrative services are focused on support and infrastructure with the additional recent expansion of our victims services area.", "Nevada's Victims of Crime Program is located here and provides financial support to individuals who have been the victims of violent crimes.", "Additionally, victims services holds Nevada's Antiterrorism and Emergency Assistance Program, a $16 million multiyear award to support victims of the Route 91 Harvest Festival shooting on October 1, 2017, in Las Vegas.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 10, 2021 Behavioral health support is a main focus of recovery for Route 91 survivors.", "Finally, through our victims of crime funding, we are providing funding for innovative programming that addresses the needs of children exposed to domestic violence and for victims of commercial sexual exploitation, including children.", "In 2020, our psychiatric residential treatment facilities achieved accreditation by the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF).", "This was a multiyear, highly intensive process that has resulted in more in-state beds for youth with higher levels of need.", "In the coming biennium, residential services will be focused on implementing the Building Bridges program\u2014a set of best practices for transforming systems to create partnerships and collaboration between families, youth, advocates, service providers, and oversight agencies.", "A primary goal of the Building Bridges program is to sustain positive outcomes after a discharge from residential placement.", "On the next slide [page 8, Exhibit D] you will see our two active sources of competitive federal funding including our pediatric mental health care access grant which works to integrate pediatric psychiatry and behavioral health consultation services into rural primary care.", "Our system of care expansion grant has multiple goals, but the overarching objective is system improvement which will expand the service array in rural Nevada and provide infrastructure to grow DCFS's capacity to serve in an oversight role for children's behavioral health.", "In particular, this system of care grant will expand access to wraparound services, respite care, and family care support.", "We have also been focused on supporting the implementation of a 1915(i) Medicaid state plan amendment to expand the service array for youth in specialized foster care, also known as treatment foster care for youth with intensive behavioral health needs.", "In our community services area, it is important to highlight the work of our mobile crisis response teams as a primary method or point of entry for families to access services and become matched to the correct services and supports for their needs [page 9].", "Using some emergency COVID-19 funding, we were able to temporarily expand the mobile crisis program to meet increased need and create additional teams, as well as expand our ability to provide telehealth services 24/7 statewide when previously, statewide 24/7 response was only available in Las Vegas.", "However, the funding is temporary.", "Finally, within community services, tiered care coordination is available to youth with multiple system needs, in order to build the family's capacity to meet their youth's needs as well as match them to formal services and supports.", "Tiered-care coordination includes High Fidelity Wraparound and a program called FOCUS for youth with intermediate-level needs.", "A lot of what we do is focused on direct services, but our quality and oversight area is where we focus more on policy and our regulatory role.", "In our quality and oversight area we are currently recruiting for a position that would be embedded in Nevada Medicaid to support policy development and on-the-ground technical assistance for schools implementing Medicaid billing.", "The position will have a particular focus on the Clark County School District as the largest district in the state.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 10, 2021 Looking to the future, there are significant workforce needs in quality and oversight.", "The Division of Child and Family Services would like to move forward with becoming the children's mental health authority in Nevada, which would allow us to set provider standards, run a technical assistance and training center for evidence-based practices, and provide oversight and quality assurance to ensure that providers using public funding for mental and behavioral health care for children are adhering to standards in quality criteria.", "We currently lack the staffing necessary to stand up the technical assistance and training center or to scale up oversight and quality assurance.", "By creating an infrastructure for widespread dissemination and oversight of evidence-based practices, particularly home and community-based services, we can follow the footsteps of other communities that have returned youth from out-of-state placements, closed residential treatment centers and juvenile justice centers, and achieved the system of care expansion goal of curating an array of effective, evidence-based, community-based treatment options.", "Our previous system of care grant identified the need for a children's mental health authority, and we were planning to begin those efforts during this legislative session.", "Given the current budget constraints, we are looking at alternate ways to begin this work.", "Our current system of care grant provides the theoretical framework in initial funding to build the beginning infrastructure for the children's mental health authority.", "However, we need a sustainable plan to position DCFS as the entity in Nevada that ensures children, youth, and families receive the best possible mental and behavioral health care so they can achieve their goals.", "I will now turn this over to Dr. Woodard to continue the presentation on behavioral health needs in Nevada.", "Stephanie Woodard: Recognizing that we have time constraints today, you have been provided with slides [Exhibit E] as well as with a few final slides on the two previous presentations which provide some links to additional resources that may be helpful if you wish to learn more about any of the topics we discussed today.", "We will now look at behavioral health in Nevada and the impact of COVID-19.", "It is important to recognize that COVID-19 as a pandemic is considered a disaster.", "Looking at how we can best estimate the impact of COVID-19 on behavioral health in Nevada and internationally, we have had to look at an existing body of research that helps us to better understand what the impact of previous disasters has had on behavioral health.", "As a disaster, COVID-19 has impacted virtually everyone in one way or another.", "Individuals who have been most directly impacted may have the most adverse experiences when it comes to responding to COVID-19.", "We have looked at a body of literature related to disaster behavioral health to help us better conceptualize what we needed to address in the response and recovery efforts [page 2].", "Most disasters have a very clear beginning, middle, and end, and when they do, there is a typical trajectory in which individuals will experience different types of stressors at different magnitudes throughout their response and recovery time periods.", "This is the best model we have had in order to better anticipate what the impacts on behavioral health could be related to COVID-19 [page 3].", "However, we recognize that there are some significant limitations to using this model.", "One of the primary limitations is that this model assumes that there is a Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 10, 2021 very clear beginning, middle, and end to a disaster, and as we all know with COVID-19, it has had a very prolonged existence in Nevada and the recovery\u2014although coming\u2014is relatively slow.", "We also recognize that the recovery from an impact such as a hurricane or tornado tends to follow a normal trajectory where there is an opportunity for inventory and community cleanup and engagement.", "However, in COVID-19, we have experienced something that is very different.", "One of the best ways for us to conceptualize the impacts of COVID-19 is to look at the stress continuum [page 4, Exhibit E].", "We recognize that there are different impacts depending on different degrees of stress.", "This includes individuals who are experiencing healthy amounts of stress all the way to individuals who have experienced incredibly prolonged exposures to high degrees of stress.", "What we know from previous disasters is that individuals who were already experiencing high degrees of distress prior to the disaster are most likely to continue to experience moderate to severe levels of distress during and post the disaster.", "However, we also know there are several impacts that a disaster can cause such as economic uncertainty, housing instability, as well as grief from experiencing bereavement that can also contribute to high levels of stressor.", "How long an individual is experiencing high degrees of stress can impact how vulnerable they are to either having difficulty in coping or beginning to experience the onset of behavioral health conditions.", "We were fortunate in Nevada to be eligible for what is called the Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program grant through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) after the declaration of the emergency was approved in April 2020.", "To formulate how we as a state were going to respond to the behavioral health needs in Nevada subsequent to COVID-19, we developed, along with FEMA and SAMHSA, this population exposure model [page 5].", "This model allows us to better understand what the potential impacts are for different populations, including vulnerable populations, so we could target our responses and resources based on the level of exposure or the potential for significant distress due to COVID-19.", "At the very bottom, we have prioritized those individuals who are bereaved or who have experienced a hospitalization, recognizing that both those events could be incredibly difficult for someone to manage.", "We also prioritized frontline health workers, especially knowing that we have been experiencing a considerable medical surge as of late.", "We see that frontline health workers, as well as emergency responders, have really been shouldering a lot of the burden related to the response to COVID-19.", "We recognize that it is not only those individuals who have been directly impacted, but the secondary and tertiary impacts that COVID-19 has had on individuals.", "This could also be loss of employment, students who have been disconnected from school, and other individuals in the community who have been responding to COVID-19.", "We have been able to respond in a number of different ways [page 6].", "Some highlights from our response and recovery activities include training well over 700 people in psychological first aid.", "We have worked with the Nevada Hospital Association on engaging hospitals in Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 10, 2021 crisis standards of care around behavioral health, crisis services, and emergency room diversion.", "We have worked to establish 24/7 psychiatric triage centers for children, adults, and adolescents to help divert them from emergency rooms.", "We have developed some programming and public service announcements, including our \"Home but Not Alone\" campaign, to get the message out to help individuals understand where resources are available should they need them.", "Starting in March 2020, within DCFS and DPBH we developed a behavioral health task force that began to look at some of the data available to help us better understand what the immediate needs and impacts were so we could develop our response strategies [page 7, Exhibit E].", "Collectively, we authored the COVID-19 behavioral health recovery plan in May 2020.", "The plan spans a number of different areas we had identified as priorities with an emphasis on promotion, prevention, and early intervention.", "It also helped us identify, if we received additional federal funds, which we have, how we would plan to allocate that funding to some of the highest needs.", "The Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program [page 8] funded the development of the Nevada Resilience Project, which has allowed Nevada to hire a number of resilience ambassadors statewide, with a focus on intervening and providing promotion, prevention, and early intervention for individuals who are struggling with stressors related to COVID-19.", "This helps us direct them to needed resources as well as to reduce stress and build on coping skills.", "We have worked with a number of community partners including the Human Services Agency of Washoe County, the Boys & Girls Club of Truckee Meadows, the Boys & Girls Clubs of Southern Nevada, and a number of other community organizations to ensure that our resilience ambassadors are available statewide when and where an individual needs additional support.", "With that, I will hand it over to Dr. Freeman.", "Megan Freeman: I am going to talk now about the state of youth mental health in terms of mental health needs before the pandemic, and what some of the impacts of the pandemic have been.", "The \"State of Mental Health in America\" is an annual report produced by Mental Health America, a community-based nonprofit utilizing national survey data.", "As you can see, Nevada typically does not fare well in the youth rankings [page 9].", "We have been 51st for the past three years, and the same is true for the overall rankings.", "On Monday, you heard from Public and Behavioral Health Deputy Administrator Julia Peek that, throughout public health in Nevada, if there is a list that is good to be at the top of, we tend to be at the bottom.", "In the youth section of the Mental Health America report there are seven indicators that make up these rankings.", "These indicators fall within the core general topic areas listed here.", "Our biggest areas of difficulty are in access to care and prevalence of substance use disorder among youth.", "These are very actionable concerns and can be addressed with investments in screening, prevention, and early intervention.", "However, it will take resources and time to move the needle on these rankings.", "The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System is a population-level survey supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and designed to monitor health risk Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 10, 2021 behaviors, identify health disparities, and monitor the effectiveness of public health interventions.", "The most recent data were collected in 2019 by the University of Nevada, Reno.", "We do our own version of the survey here and sample more widely than the CDC does.", "The data were collected at all regular public, charter, and alternative high schools and middle schools in Nevada.", "This slide [page 10, Exhibit E] draws attention to some of the most important behavioral health findings from the survey, including up to two in five youth struggling with significant feelings of depression, up to one in five youth having seriously considered suicide in the past year, and one in five youth engaging in self-harm.", "On this same survey, 15 percent of middle schoolers and 56 percent of high schoolers reported that they never or rarely got the kind of help they needed when they felt sad, empty, hopeless, angry, or anxious.", "This data is consistent with our core national rankings on access to care.", "On this next slide [page 11], you will see the top ten diagnoses most commonly associated with Medicaid billing for behavioral health for youth ages 0-18.", "These are 2019 numbers, so this was prior to the pandemic.", "For the sake of time, I will leave this for reference, but you will notice that mood and anxiety disorders are prominent.", "These are some of the risk factors and stressors that youth and families are coping with right now [page 12].", "I want to emphasize that isolation and loneliness are associated with risk of future mental health problems, most commonly depression.", "However, while youth are reporting increased anxiety, depression, and stress right now, some teenagers are actually reporting increased life satisfaction which they say is because of more time for sleep, more time with family, and protection from some of the stressors of regular in-person life, like bullying.", "One of the major concerns that has been well documented throughout the pandemic is the lack of adult eyes on children who would normally be interacting frequently with teachers, school staff, pediatricians, coaches, faith leaders, and in lots of other arenas.", "We have seen a significant drop in calls to child protective services (CPS) from educational professionals in schools.", "However, over time, we have started to see more calls coming in from law enforcement and other professionals such as physicians.", "Total call numbers have returned to overall seasonal patterns at a slightly decreased rate compared to prior years [page 13].", "I see this as an overall systems success as our communities have adjusted to the needs and current circumstances.", "This graph shows calls to our children's mobile crisis response hotline [page 14].", "You will notice the same general pattern as the CPS hotline calls\u2014a large decrease at the onset of the pandemic followed by a gradual return to regular seasonal patterns.", "For mobile crisis, the return to normal happened when children returned to school in the fall.", "This actually caused a spike in need, but it has remained high since that time.", "This slide shows a change in the hospital diversion rate for mobile crisis [page 15].", "This is the number of youth stabilized safely in the community or diverted from psychiatric hospitalization.", "Initially, mobile crisis saw a decrease in hospital diversion, indicating that more youth were being hospitalized.", "The program reports that this is due to youth with more Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 10, 2021 serious levels of risk presenting for care and more difficulty in placing community supports around the youth due to isolation and quarantine.", "I also want to make you aware of a national trend reported by the CDC in the fall.", "Although the overall number of pediatric visits to emergency departments decreased by about 7 percent during lock-down and stay-at-home efforts, the proportion of visits that were related to behavioral health was 40-60 percent higher than normal during April through October [page 16, Exhibit E].", "Most emergency departments lack the appropriate resources for providing behavioral health care, so we want to increase the availability of immediate in-crisis care when and where youth and families need to access it.", "Finally, I would like to address the topic of youth suicide.", "On the blue bars on this chart [page 17], you are looking at the total number of suicides for ages 0-17 for 2010 to 2020.", "The dotted line is the national suicide rate, which has been increasing steadily over the past decade.", "The black line is Nevada's suicide rate, which has been fluctuating around the national rate.", "On Monday, you heard a little bit about public health surveillance from Division of Public and Behavioral Health Deputy Administrator Julia Peek.", "She talked about how typically public health surveillance does not occur in real time, and youth suicide is the same.", "Although I know this topic has been in the news and in all our hearts recently, our 2020 numbers have not yet been finalized through the Office of Vital Statistics, so they could change from what you see here.", "It is too early to draw conclusions about how the pandemic has changed the youth suicide rates in Nevada or anywhere.", "What we do know so far about the impact of the pandemic on suicide in Nevada is that our 2020 total is not out of the realm of what is normal for Nevada over the past decade.", "I am a parent.", "One fatality is too many, and we strive for zero suicides, but I would like to encourage us as a public health system not to focus on fatalities as the only important indicator of the burden of suicide in Nevada.", "That is why we are putting into place syndromic surveillance at hospitals and urgent care centers to better understand the full spectrum of help-seeking for suicidal behavior.", "This is monitoring of the number of visits where the person presents with a suicide attempt.", "Additionally, we must continue to expand crisis services and provide outreach so that children, youth, families, and individuals who are suffering know where to go to get help.", "Stephanie Woodard: I will take a little glimpse into the Mental Health America report, this time specific to adults and mental health.", "This report comes out annually and uses a number of different metrics to look at the progress, or lack thereof, that mental health services are having in specific states.", "Here you will see a number of different rankings [page 18].", "The category of \"adults with any mental illness\" has continued to increase.", "Where Nevada is about 20 percent, the United States average is 19 percent.", "In Nevada, the category of \"adults with a substance use disorder in the past year\" is at 9 percent where the United States is 7 percent.", "These data are from a study done in 2018.", "One of the issues we have with these reports is because the data Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 10, 2021 is so outdated, sometimes it is very difficult to attribute what it is we are seeing in the data to what we are seeing in the state here and now.", "But we do use these as indicators to be able to measure progress as we look at this data year over year.", "I also want to note that there have been some improvements in some of the areas related to adult mental health, including a reduction in adults expressing serious thoughts of suicide and adults with any mental illness who did not receive treatment.", "We actually have increased the number of individuals who may have needed treatment and did receive treatment.", "As for adults with cognitive disability who did not see a doctor due to cost, we have seen a good reduction in those numbers, which has enhanced our scores here.", "The reason I think it is important to discuss these data is because far too often we hear people use the shortcut that Nevada ranks fifty-first, but there are a lot of nuanced data points that go into that overall ranking.", "It is important to look in a more detailed fashion to understand what could be driving some of our rankings [page 19, Exhibit E].", "As was pointed out, the rate of suicide in Nevada in 2020 specific for youth was not unusual compared to years past, and we see similar trends across all age groups including adults and individuals aged 65.", "Again, I want to caution that these data are preliminary and subject to change.", "We have experienced an increase in opioid overdose deaths over the course of COVID-19 [page 20].", "We had seen a relatively steady reduction over the last few years, but now we have seen the highest rate we have had in the past decade with 484 fatalities in 2020.", "There are a lot of reasons why this could be, not the least of which are increase in isolation and lack of access to care.", "In November we had a red alert through the national drug helpline which noted that Nevada had a 50 percent increase in overdose deaths between the first and second quarters of 2020.", "Much of this is driven by non-COVID-19-related issues, including the proliferation of synthetic opioids including fentanyl.", "We have been seeing this troubling trend growing nationally even pre-COVID-19, but we realize that COVID-19 could have had a significant impact in changing some of these numbers in Nevada.", "We have also seen an increase in emergency room (ER) utilization rates for individuals with suspected opioid-related emergency department encounters.", "We had a 26 percent increase in 2020, while the overall drug-related emergency department use increased only 3 percent.", "So, while we saw a 3 percent increase overall, the vast majority\u201426 percent\u2014was related to opioid overdoses.", "We are seeing an increase in utilization within Medicaid for substance use disorder, and we saw a pretty significant increase in 2020 for individuals in the Medicaid programming accepting substance use disorder treatment services [page 21].", "We have been watching very closely a number of different indicators to help us better understand what is happening with traditional behavioral health service utilization.", "We have not seen a very significant increase in overall utilization during COVID-19 [page 22].", "There are a number of different reasons for this, not the least of which is that we did have a substantial time period where we had stay-at-home orders, and we know that individuals have been avoiding care.", "We also know that, following disasters, we typically see an increase in need for traditional behavioral health services between 12 and 18 months following the anniversary of the appearance of the disaster.", "We anticipate that we may see increased needs for services moving forward following March 2021.", "We have seen an Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 10, 2021 increase in crisis services.", "We have seen a 170 percent increase in calls to the warm-line and increases in both acuity and the length of calls for our lifeline for crisis support services of Nevada.", "Through the Nevada Resilience Project, which is about promotion, prevention, and early intervention, we have been able to serve almost 73,000 individuals statewide since June.", "Our COVID-19 ER grant recipients who are providing crisis triage and inpatient services have seen an approximately 100 percent increase year over year in individuals looking to access care.", "We continue to watch and monitor to see what the impact could be on overall traditional behavioral health services, and currently, we have not seen a significant increase.", "Where we have seen a nice change is in telehealth [page 23, Exhibit E].", "Telehealth utilization for behavioral health services helped with continuity of care for individuals who had previously been engaged in behavioral health services.", "But we also saw a marked increase in individuals who initiated treatment services utilizing telehealth.", "Pre-COVID-19, approximately 24 percent of individuals had had their initial visit via telehealth, and that moved to 41 percent of initial visits during the six months following March 2020.", "There is certainly a lot of work to do in the road ahead [pages 24 and 25].", "We have to recognize that there is a risk for increased and severe distress as it relates to our economic recovery; the more prolonged this recovery is, the more likely that individuals will continue to experience distress.", "We have to recognize there is a risk for increased suffering among children, parents, and caregivers due to isolation, loneliness, and stress related to school closures as they persist.", "We must address the needs for individuals who are struggling to cope and manage with new or ongoing stressors, and recognize the opportunities for prevention and early intervention as recovery continues.", "Some of our priorities are to prioritize basic systems that help keep people safe and secure, focusing on social determinants of health such as economic factors\u2014food security, housing stability, access to health care, and access to education.", "We need increased capacity to provide school-based behavioral health care for children.", "We need to continue efforts to promote, prevent, and intervene early when individuals are having difficulty coping; provide crisis services for individuals and families when and where they need them, to include suicide prevention; and continue efforts to build community and family resilience.", "Chair Nguyen: You did an amazing job, and I know I asked a lot by asking you to consolidate everything that is going on in this mental health field.", "We do have a couple of questions.", "Assemblywoman Peters: I echo what the Chair said about getting all that information to us in such a shortened period of time.", "I have a question related to your data.", "Are there any data gaps you have identified?", "We need to ensure that we have all the information we need to develop response policies, to be certain we are getting those resources to children and families when and where they need them.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 10, 2021 Megan Freeman: An amazing thing about Nevada is that we are collecting a ton of data on children.", "We have data on crisis teams, and we get a lot of data through the schools.", "There are a couple of different initiatives on collecting data through the schools.", "Right now, we need to focus our efforts on suicide prevention.", "We would like to be getting more real-time information from hospital emergency departments and urgent cares about individuals across the lifespan who are presenting with suicidal behaviors.", "That will help us understand in more recent or more real time what the needs are and who has the need\u2014where we need to focus our prevention efforts.", "Assemblywoman Peters: That is great to hear.", "I have been working with Dr. Woodard on a bill that I hope will help allow us to fill that data gap in particular.", "Assemblywoman Titus: I appreciate Dr. Woodard and Dr. Freeman presenting today.", "I know it was a lot of information in a short amount of time.", "I have questions regarding slides 8 and 18 [pages 8 and 18, Exhibit E].", "Nevada continues to be fifty-first in all those data points\u2014the worst of the worst, as you pointed out.", "This is my fourth session.", "I have seen presentations every session because I have been on this Health and Human Services Committee each time.", "We are not moving that needle at all.", "Each time we hear these presentations, we talk about collecting data.", "At some point, we have to make some changes because, before I am termed out, I would love to see some of those needles moving and that there is some improvement.", "I have not heard anything more than that you are collecting more data.", "I am not hearing any solutions.", "I would like to know whether the number of childhood behavior specialists has increased.", "What are we doing about reaching out and educating folks so that we can get more providers so there is more access to care?", "I know we have more Medicaid recipients signed up, but that does not mean there is better access to care, and I have huge concerns about that.", "At some point\u2014you may not have that today, and we are limited for time\u2014but I would like to see the number of providers available in your system.", "What are we doing to outreach?", "Are we using reciprocity to get these people licensed so there will be more access?", "That is my first question\u2014what are you doing for the specialists these people see?", "My second question concerns telehealth data.", "You said we have increased the use of telehealth from 24 percent to 41 percent, but that does not mean there has actually been increased access to care.", "It means that maybe the individual was unable to get into the office and might not otherwise be going to see that provider unless it was via telehealth.", "I do not know that is actually a greater percentage of access, so I would like to see some data on what we are actually doing to have folks get access to care.", "At the end of the day, follow-up access to care, getting into treatment programs, and having specialists available for adults and children is really when we are going to start solving these problems, so perhaps you can get us more information on the actual providers.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 10, 2021 Megan Freeman: I will briefly speak on your question and then it might be best for me to take this back to our division leadership, and they can submit more information to you in writing.", "One thing I will point out is Mental Health America reports in any given year are based on data that was collected three years prior.", "It is very possible that we have made strides in the past three years that will not be reflected until we see the rankings on future years' reports.", "We have been working to expand our system of care in Nevada.", "I think that is very significant for children, and we just may not be seeing those numbers reflected yet in the report; however, we will submit a response to you in writing regarding your questions about providers and the other aspects of your questions.", "Assemblywoman Titus: Thank you.", "I do not think there is a person in this meeting who does not want to see Nevada rise out of that fifty-first ranking in so many things, and I appreciate all you are doing.", "Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: Is your department partnering with any national organizations or nonprofits to address some of the mental health issues throughout the state?", "Do you have any certified nonprofit organizations able to go into the schools and give presentations to kids or do outreach and get the message out that there are resources and help available so people know more about them?", "In southern Nevada, I am seeing a lot more open, frank discussion about mental health.", "The more support we have for those conversations from your department, the better we will be able to reach people in our community.", "Megan Freeman: We would love to partner with you to understand more about what you are seeing.", "We can get you a list of our community and national partners that provide us with technical assistance.", "We seek a lot of support and technical assistance, but there is always room for improvement, so we would love to have that conversation with you.", "Chair Nguyen: If there is any other documentation you have, please provide it to our policy analyst, and he can distribute it to all Committee members.", "I also encourage everyone to reach out to our presenters.", "Their contact information has been provided to you, so you may follow up with any additional offline conversations about what we can do in our state.", "We will now move on to our regional behavioral health policy boards.", "I have basically asked almost the impossible from our next presenters.", "I have asked them to introduce themselves and give us a five-minute presentation each, so we will begin.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 10, 2021 Valerie Cauhape Haskin, Rural Regional Behavioral Health Coordinator, Rural Regional Behavioral Health Policy Board: There is a handout in your packet [Exhibit F] that accompanies this presentation [Exhibit G] which gives far more detail about the board than I am able to present to you today.", "The Rural Regional Behavioral Health Policy Board represents a six-county region in northeastern Nevada which includes Elko, Eureka, Humboldt, Lander, Pershing, and White Pine Counties.", "The combined area of this region is slightly larger than the state of Mississippi, and the population sits at just under 100,000.", "So, this large expansive space covered by the region and the geographic distance of specialty services influences a lot of our board's priorities.", "The priorities seen here were adopted by the board in early 2020 and will be revised and updated at the board's next meeting on February 24 [pages 2 and 3, Exhibit F].", "One of the major issues community members in our region face is transportation, both to and from behavioral health services.", "This is the case for both crisis and noncrisis services.", "While a person in crisis may be able to get emergency transportation to in-person services in Reno, Carson City, or Las Vegas, our stakeholders have alerted us to many persons being released from emergency care without direct transportation home.", "In those cases, they may be stuck in the city where they were released or sometimes they have been put on public transportation for the return home, often without medication, food, or water, and, due to multiple connections, this may take more than one day.", "Initially, the lion's share of the persons in our regions seeking behavioral health care services are either covered or eligible for Medicaid.", "Thus, previous to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was a priority of the board to seek improved Medicaid reimbursement for behavioral health services to ensure the providers could maintain service levels to meet their needs.", "Due to budgetary cuts and concerns over the last year, that

our frontier communities and is often even worse in regard to behavioral health services.", "The board has prioritized seeking ways to improve the ability of local organizations to recruit behavioral health providers, including improving paths to licensure for those who are moving to Nevada from out of state.", "This is addressed in the board's bill this legislative session, Senate Bill 44.", "While state and local partners have made great strides in improving data quality and communication, this is still a persistent issue within our region.", "Assisting our local stakeholders in improving the quality and accuracy of the data collected at the local level and how it is communicated to state and other regional stakeholders is another priority of the board.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 10, 2021 The board has thought to increase its visibility in an attempt to better engage local, regional, and state stakeholders and increase communication regarding current resources and challenges.", "The board prioritizes supporting programs that consider the needs of youth, elders, and families in a holistic approach, as issues within family units do not frequently happen in a vacuum, and addressing the issues throughout the family circuit may have improved outcomes.", "Last but not least, the Nevada Department of Veterans Services has made it known to us that our region has a comparatively high percentage of veterans within our population.", "The board prioritizes efforts that improve the quality and access to services for those who have served our nation in the armed forces.", "While many communities in our region may be geographically isolated, they were not unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic [page 3, Exhibit G].", "The information we are discussing here has been shared in community stakeholder meetings.", "It should be cautioned that many local organizations involved are focusing their limited resources on response, so data available may not currently reflect these concerns.", "Hopefully, they will be able to catch up as pressure from COVID-19 response subsides.", "Also, please remember that in such small communities, large increases may constitute small numbers in comparison to urban communities.", "However, with the already thin behavioral health services available, it does not take much to overwhelm local resources.", "Early on, our local hospitals saw an increase in the number of persons presenting to the emergency departments in crisis.", "While some of these community members had presented to the local hospitals in crisis before, most of them were experiencing mental health crises for the first time.", "This was followed by a sort of second wave of problems where hospitals were seeing more patients who were presenting for reasons related to increased alcohol and substance abuse, as well as increased intentional overdoses.", "Our local stakeholders have reported major concerns regarding increases in depression and anxiety among youth as well as frontline workers in health care, law enforcement, and other emergency health services.", "Additionally, increased isolation among community

analysis of where Washoe County is in terms of readiness to stand up a crisis stabilization center remains something on which the board is focused.", "In response to the ongoing issue of individuals experiencing behavioral health crises and often being taken to jail or emergency rooms inappropriately, these facilities are considered an emergency health care alternative.", "The strategy for success for this state-supported endeavor began in the 80th Legislative Session with the introduction and passage of Assembly Bill 66 of the 80th Session which addressed some components of this type of facility.", "During this biennium, our strategy for moving forward includes the completion of an assets-and-gaps analysis, a visit to one of the originators of the concept in Arizona, and increased collaboration with partners in our state, city and county leadership to discuss the next steps.", "While Washoe remains well-poised in some required elements, challenges to success include finding sustained funding, infrastructure, and then developing the policies and processes required for collaboration between agencies [page 1, Exhibit I].", "It does remain a strong priority in our county.", "A second priority is equitable focus on substance misuse [page 1].", "While we know that behavioral health encompasses mental health and substance misuse, there has been some concern expressed that the focus of programs, funding, and policy might be inequitable between the two.", "Understanding that the two are often co-occurring, we need to work to ensure that there is inclusion and collaboration with all sectors of behavioral health.", "Strategy for success began as we invited presenters from all sides of behavioral health including substance misuse treatment, prevention, and recovery, to provide information, education, and solicitation for a change in legislation through a bill draft.", "Several of those were selected for the board's current bill, Senate Bill 69.", "Our work and focus will include supporting the development of a diverse, culturally appropriate, inclusive, and well-trained workforce in both areas of mental health.", "Behavioral health response before, during, and after a crisis needs to be talked about [pages 1 and 2].", "If we learned anything from this public health crisis, it is that we need a robust plan and trained staff to focus on the sometimes overwhelming behavioral health consequences of an emergent event.", "Our strategy in Washoe for success included participating in the resilience project.", "Another strategy was the development this year of a draft behavioral health annex to our regional emergency response plan.", "We will continue to encourage and reach out to all organizations to take advantage of resources for training, such as in psychological first aid, with the goal of creating community response teams to activate when needed during an event.", "We look forward to conducting drills and exercises with

seen as the top concern cited by the community, and one that greatly suffers from lack of adequate resources and an available workforce.", "It also ties in closely to the housing focus area, as many chronically homeless individuals suffer from mental illness and substance use disorders, and adequate housing is seen as a critical foundation to providing successful treatment.", "The Washoe board

provide access to behavioral health data and for the ease of use for providers and residents of Clark County.", "The big thing that happened in 2020 is the pandemic crisis.", "We have seen an increase in the number of people seeking services on a national level as well as in Nevada.", "As we heard in previous presentations, we have an increasing number of adults, youth, and children reporting symptoms of anxiety and depression, and we have had an increase in the number of suicides.", "We are also seeing disproportionate impacts on Blacks, indigenous people and people of color, and on other populations including the elderly, individuals with developmental disabilities, residents of rural communities, and people living in poverty.", "These concerns and challenges drive the board's

Assemblywoman Titus's point, we have seen some progress in our region, and it is quite exciting.", "I spoke about the Mallory Crisis Center [page 5].", "That has been really pivotal to have that 24/7 access for people in crisis.", "We are also very lucky to have certified community behavioral health centers (CCBHC), and both Carson Tahoe and the CCBHCs have assertive community treatment teams

individuals who had been in crisis for ten years who are now stable.", "Dr. Woodard mentioned their emphasis on making jail reentry and criminal justice diversion evidence-based.", "The state has done a lot of work with us to bring our jail reentry teams up to evidence-based practice, and we are very grateful for that.", "So we think we are making progress in developing this comprehensive mental health system bit by bit.", "What we think is working in our region is that we have these local behavioral health task forces that provide community input into the northern board [page 6, Exhibit

excited to be here today to present Assembly Bill 62 which helps to innovate and strengthen Nevada's ABLE Savings Program to ensure that Nevadans with disabilities have the opportunity to save for a better future.", "Broadly speaking, ABLE accounts are tax-advantaged savings accounts that allow people with disabilities to earn and save money without losing access to vital programs like Medicaid and social security.", "By making these tax-free savings accounts available to individuals to cover qualified disability-related expenses for things like education, housing, and transportation, the program aims to ease the financial burden faced by citizens with disabilities who are the most underemployed demographic group in the state.", "In the 2019 Legislative Session, our office worked with Assemblywoman Cohen and the Division of Aging and Disability Services to pass A.B.", "130 of the 80th Session which moved the entire ABLE Savings Program into the Treasurer's Office.", "Since that time, our office has worked with hundreds of Nevadans with disabilities and their families to make sure they can gain access to these accounts without any impact or cost to the State's General Fund.", "The provisions of A.B.", "62 would make Nevada the first state in the country to find innovative ways to incentivize people with disabilities to open these accounts and build up account balances to build their own great big, beautiful tomorrow.", "I will now ask Erik Jimenez from our office to walk through the specifics of the bill.", "Before I do that, I would like to mention the tremendous work Erik has done focusing on the ABLE Savings Program over the last two years.", "His singular effort has helped hundreds of Nevada families, and he did that while helping me coordinate the largest recovery effort in the state's history.", "Erik Jimenez, Senior Deputy Treasurer, Office of the State Treasurer: Passage of the ABLE Act of 2014 was the single greatest move toward disability independence since the Americans with Disabilities Act.", "When we took the program over from the Aging and Disability Services Division (ADSD) in 2019, there were a little over 200 accounts with about $1 million in assets.", "We have grown that to more than 1,000 accounts with over $6 million in assets, all using zero dollars from the State's General Fund.", "We do this for free.", "It is not in the state's interest to make money on these accounts.", "We do it so people with disabilities can save, possibly get out of bad situations, and build a brighter future.", "Broadly speaking, we have a simple bill in front of you today, and I would be remiss if I did not thank Karly O'Krent from the Legislative Counsel Bureau for working with us on the bill.", "This bill modernizes our ABLE accounts to mirror our Nevada College Kickstart program which gives $50 to every kindergartener in Nevada to kickstart savings.", "When I talk to families about the benefits of ABLE accounts, one of the biggest barriers is earning an income without losing their Medicaid and/or social security benefits, but they also do not Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 10, 2021 have the startup capital to open a bank account.", "We would like to find some innovative ways to pay for seeding and growing these accounts that make them more sustainable for the state going forward.", "The bill would authorize our office to promulgate regulations that would incentivize the opening of new accounts, similar to how we already do with Nevada College Kickstart, and then to incentivize regular deposits from existing account holders.", "So, if someone has an ABLE account and wants to start contributing, say $100 a month, how can the state meet that person halfway and start to figure out how to match?", "All of this we are proposing to not be funded out of the General Fund.", "There would be no tax for this program; it would be done purely through private philanthropy and federal grant funding.", "I want to thank some of the groups that have already expressed interest in doing that, particularly the Nevada Bankers Association.", "It has been a great partner in making sure we get awareness about these accounts to the public.", "Chair Nguyen: Are there any questions?", "Assemblywoman Gorelow: What is considered to be a qualifying disability?", "Erik Jimenez: A qualified disability expense is any expense that is incurred as a result of living with a disability.", "It is intended to improve someone's quality of life.", "When the bill was passed and signed, the idea was to make the categories as flexible as possible so as to encourage people to save but also allow them to use these expenses for pretty much anything the individual would encounter.", "Those vary from education, health and wellness, housing, transportation, legal and professional fees, financial management, employment training and support, assistive technology, and personal support services.", "I get asked that question a lot when I talk to families.", "They ask things such as whether they could open an ABLE account and use that money to take a trip to Disneyland.", "We are trying to make the argument that, if it improves that individual's quality of life, better mental health, I could make an argument that it would be an eligible expense.", "The goal is to make it as broad as possible so these folks can spend this money just as anyone else would with their checkbook.", "Assemblywoman Gorelow: Who qualifies?", "What disabilities would qualify?", "Erik Jimenez: There is guidance from the Social Security Administration's \"blue book,\" but people with significant disabilities that occur prior to the age of 26 are eligible for an ABLE account.", "In terms of disabilities, any intellectual development disabilities, autism, Down's syndrome, and those sorts of things would qualify.", "We work with the Nevada Justice Association on making sure that people with mental health disorders also can qualify for these accounts, but most disabilities are covered under the ABLE Act.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 10, 2021 Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: Thank you for all the work you have done on the ABLE Program.", "I have a question about section 1, subsection 4, paragraph (a), subparagraph (3), \"Methods and incentives to encourage contributions to a savings trust account.\"", "Could you tell us more about what we might expect to see when talking about \"incentives\"?", "Erik Jimenez: We wanted to be very deliberate insofar as we do not know how much money we will be able to bring in either from federal grants or from private dollars.", "We did not want to commit in statute to a particular dollar figure if we could not meet that dollar figure.", "Assuming this bill works its way through the process, we can secure some funding and then outline what that minimum threshold would be.", "At this point, we are looking at between $50 to $100, and we would define that clearly through regulations that would go through the Legislative Commission.", "But at this point, we are giving ourselves flexibility if that dollar number moves around a little bit.", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: My assumption is that this would be a cash incentive for opening an account\u2014perhaps like the College Kickstart Program.", "Is that what I should view as a frame of reference?", "Erik Jimenez: I think that is exactly right.", "We are continually working through this process, and I want to make sure that we clarify in the regulations that our ABLE account program is open to anyone in the country.", "It would be important to clarify this for the record that Nevada participants in this program would be eligible for the incentives.", "While I appreciate people from other states participating in our program, our goal here is trying to help as many Nevadans as we can.", "Zach Conine: That would match some of the work we do on the college savings front, where there are matching programs available for individuals living in Nevada, even though the programs are broadly available for everyone.", "Chair Nguyen: Are there any other questions?", "[There was no reply.]", "I have one comment.", "When we spoke about this bill, you mentioned that this has not been enacted anywhere else, so this would be a unique, innovative program.", "Other people around the country would be looking at Nevada as a model in this area.", "Can you speak to that?", "Erik Jimenez: That is why we wanted to bring this bill forward\u2014to make it abundantly clear that the legislative intent is to move forward with a program like this.", "We would be the first program in the country to do something like this.", "We are part of an alliance of states that administer ABLE accounts, and I talk to most of them on a monthly basis.", "The states of California and Oregon are anxiously watching this bill to see if we are successful, because they would love Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 10, 2021 to replicate that success.", "Additionally, we have been in conversation with the United States Senate Special Committee on Aging and its chairman, who is from Pennsylvania.", "They are also watching us to see if this is successful.", "If it is, they could replicate this on the federal level and do some sort of block grant into ABLE accounts to make sure we incentivize that growth.", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: I see here that you are going to develop the methods and incentives to encourage contributions to the savings trust account but that there is also going to be an endowment piece.", "I imagine that once you are successful\u2014which we know you will be\u2014in getting grants into that main endowment, can you explain what that procedure will look like, in terms of distribution to those individual accounts?", "Will it be a penny-for-penny distribution?", "Will there be an administrative set-aside out of the endowment?", "Erik Jimenez: Conceptually, we want to figure out a way that we could find a dollar figure that works for either the initial contribution or the matching contribution.", "Not using General Fund dollars, it could be really hard to do an exact penny-for-penny match.", "We have some logistical things to work out on our end since we would be the first state in the country.", "Mechanically, we want to streamline this so it is a little more effective than our College Kickstart program.", "As you are aware, Nevada College Kickstart is a separate ledger account.", "The intention here would be to make that contribution go directly into the ABLE account, so there are not two separate accounts which would create more friction in the savings.", "The seed money would be earning interest, and then would be able to be used and saved by the individual.", "Assemblywoman Titus: Could the individuals contribute to the savings accounts themselves?", "We heard testimony from folks who had a small business selling popcorn that it would be counted against them when it comes to support for some of the social services they needed.", "Would they put that money into this account?", "Erik Jimenez: That is 100 percent accurate.", "Individuals with these accounts can save up to $15,000 a year without losing access to means-tested benefits\u2014food assistance programs, Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI).", "If one is working, for instance, Jack with the popcorn company, Jack can save an additional $12,000 into his account.", "The real benefit is getting people with disabilities to start saving, but also to start working so they can live independently.", "Twenty-seven thousand dollars a year is really beneficial, and can get someone out of poverty.", "Assemblywoman Titus: That is the thing I was most impressed by with this program, and why I am so supportive of it.", "It is really enabling them to get a business going, and while doing that, not fearing they would be kicked off the welfare system or their health care\u2014things they need so desperately.", "Thank you for that clarification and thank you for bringing this forward.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 10, 2021 Chair Nguyen: Are there any other questions?", "I do not see any more, so at this time, we will hear testimony in support, opposition, and neutral.", "Again, to provide testimony, you have to register online at the legislative website.", "Registrants will receive a phone number, meeting ID, and instructions on how to join the meeting.", "Remember to clearly state your name and spell it for the record and limit your testimony to two minutes.", "Again, staff will be

opportunities for Nevadans.", "We are excited to support Nevada's ABLE Savings Program as it makes sure that a person living with a disability is not penalized because that person is saving money.",

leaders in this, not only in our state but, as you heard, influencing policy around the country.", "We would also like to recognize the fact that these men have worked tirelessly throughout this pandemic to help countless Nevadans.", "They have been answering phone calls and emails late at night, working on the weekends and holidays, and they are still able to bring forward and tackle policy changes such as the one before you today.", "We very much appreciate them and everything they do for Nevada and are grateful for this opportunity to testify.", "We encourage your support of A.B.",

Constitution to address four words.", "Well, let me tell you what these four words are: insane, blind, deaf, and dumb.", "These words are found in Section 1, Article 13 of our Constitution.", "This section requires the state to care for certain populations with disabilities or who suffer from a mental illness.", "The whole section reads like this: Section 1.", "Institutions for Insane, Blind, Deaf and Dumb to be fostered and supported by state.", "Institutions for the benefit of the Insane, Blind and Deaf and Dumb, and such other benevolent institutions as the public good may require, shall be fostered and supported by the State, subject to such regulations as may be prescribed by law.", "I am aware that when the Nevada Constitution was written, different terminologies were used to describe persons with disabilities or a mental illness.", "However, more than 156 years after Nevada was admitted into the Union, it is time to give these words a more critical look.", "We should change them to contemporary language that is not deemed to be discriminatory or narrow.", "I propose we revise this terminology in the following manner: 1. from \"the insane\" to \"persons with a significant mental illness\"; 2. from \"the blind\" to \"persons who are blind or visually impaired\"; and 3. from \"the deaf and dumb\" to \"persons who are deaf or hard of hearing.\"", "The idea to change this language in our Constitution came from one of my constituents, Mr. Andrew Campbell, who will be joining me later for this bill introduction.", "He works in the Churchill County Middle School as a special education teacher.", "Most of his students have severe to profound disabilities.", "Mr. Campbell also teaches American Sign Language in an after-school program, and he is very much aware of the needs of persons who are deaf or hard of hearing.", "He describes them as smart and dedicated people in our society who work in banks, are teachers or engineers.", "His own grandfather

about the details of my proposed amendment.", "First, I want the new terms to start with \"persons.\"", "We must stop categorizing people who suffer from an illness or disability by putting an emphasis on their illness or disability, for example, \"the blind\" or \"the deaf.\"", "Instead, these are all individuals who happen to have an illness or disability, but first and foremost, they are \"persons.\"", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 10, 2021 Second, calling persons who have a hearing loss \"dumb\" in our own Constitution is plainly offensive.", "This term must go.", "Additionally, many people in our society are not completely deaf but may suffer from different degrees of hearing loss.", "The definition in the Constitution is too narrow, and, therefore, I think it should say \"persons who are deaf or hard of hearing.\"", "\"Insane\" is another one of those derogatory terms I recommend replacing.", "We know that words matter, and when you stigmatize individuals with such a term, it may lead to negative results in the long run.", "Research has shown that stigmatizing persons with a significant mental illness may create barriers for them.", "They may face discrimination and prejudice when renting homes, applying for jobs, or accessing mental health services.", "Stigmatized people also are less likely to seek the help they need to treat their condition, which might make their condition worse.", "Using the term \"insane\" in our Constitution for people who suffer from a mental illness helps to perpetuate this stigma.", "Therefore, it should be replaced with the more dignified term \"persons with a significant mental illness.\"", "\"Blind\" is not necessarily a discriminatory term, but I think it is too narrow.", "If a person is blind, he or she may suffer a complete or nearly complete vision loss; however, this term does not include any of the people who have a visual impairment that causes difficulties with normal daily activities, and which cannot be fixed by simply wearing glasses or contact lenses.", "Persons with visual impairments may not be able to walk or read without adaptive training or the use of assistive technology.", "Contemporary training and assistive technology programs are for all people who have some kind of visual impairment.", "Therefore, this language should be updated as well, and I propose the term \"persons who are blind or visually impaired.\"", "In closing, I believe we must do a better job in making sure that we do not discriminate and stigmatize persons with disabilities or mental illnesses in our laws.", "A first step is to ensure no discriminating, stigmatizing, or derogatory language is in our Nevada Constitution, and A.J.R.", "1 will provide for that.", "Please keep in mind, this resolution is just a first step.", "It will not apply to the Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS).", "For example, if you do a simple search in our law library on the legislative website, you can find 67 hits with the term \"insane.\"", "I hope there will be another opportunity soon to clean up our statutes as well.", "I urge you to support A.J.R.", "1 to end the stigmatization of our citizens in the Nevada Constitution.", "I might add that there has been a friendly amendment suggested; hopefully, the members of this Committee have a copy.", "If not, I will read it, and we will make sure everyone gets a copy.", "This amendment came from Dena Schmidt, Administrator of the Aging and Disability Services Division in the Department of Health and Human Services [Exhibit N].", "She recommended, and I agree with her, that the new section 1 would read, Institutions for the benefit of persons with a significant mental illness, persons who are blind or visually impaired, persons who are deaf and hard of hearing,\u2014and this is the friendly amendment, so it is not in the bill you Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 10, 2021 received\u2014\"or persons who have an intellectual or developmental disability,\" and such other benevolent institutions as the public good may require.", "I also might add that a number of members of this body in both the Senate and the Assembly have asked to be joint sponsors with me.", "If anyone else wants to sponsor this bill, I would welcome everyone's name on this bill as cosponsors.", "This was a prefiled bill, so I put it in on my own, but I think this is something we all should embrace.", "I will turn this over to Mr. Campbell to make some remarks.", "Chair Nguyen: I believe that friendly amendment has been uploaded onto the Nevada Electronic Legislative Information System so you all will be able to see it.", "If this bill goes forward to a work session it will be amended, so you may reach out to Assemblywoman Titus if you would like to be added on as a sponsor.", "Andrew Campbell, Private Citizen, Yerington, Nevada: Thanks to Assemblywoman Titus for initiating this process.", "It is one that is close to my heart.", "I am here testifying today as a citizen of the state of Nevada and resident of Churchill County.", "I have total deafness in one ear, and I have had total temporary blindness.", "I know what it is like to live with that, and it is a challenge.", "The fact that you are all attentive to this matter, not only for myself, but for so many members of our community and families, is much appreciated as this goes forward.", "Chair Nguyen: Are there questions or comments?", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: I love the bill, its language, and its intent.", "I was diagnosed with a hearing loss at age 30 and told I would be deaf within 20 years.", "That continues to progress, and I definitely do not want these adjectives applied to me.", "I am wondering about the conforming language where you talk about a change in statute.", "This is a change to the Constitution, and it will take some time.", "If we have a successful constitutional change, is that when we would look at the NRS for the conforming language to make sure the statutes line up?", "Would we need a proactive bill draft request or, once there is a constitutional change, does it roll out on the back end?", "Assemblywoman Titus: I would like to turn this over to our legal counsel to answer that question.", "That is also why I am open to the process of getting the wording correct, because the wording has to be matched next session, and the resolution needs to be passed again.", "Then it has to go to a vote of the people to change our Constitution.", "That is why it is so critical that we get it as right as we can.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 10, 2021 I know the wording regarding \"insane\" has been changed in prior legislative sessions, and we have changed definitions, but we have never gone through the entire NRS and retrospectively changed all that wording.", "That would take a different bill, I believe.", "Chair Nguyen: Ms. O'Krent, could you answer these concerns?", "Karly O'Krent, Legal Counsel, Legislative Counsel Bureau: Typically, when there are issues like this in a bill, we would include something that would authorize us to make the additional changes in the NRS when we are codifying things.", "Because this is a bill that does make a change to the Constitution and will have to be passed by another Legislature and then voted on, at the time it has been voted on, we would need to make the changes pursuant to a separate bill that would then make the proper changes in NRS.", "Chair Nguyen: Are there any other questions or comments?", "I see in the chat that Assemblyman Hafen and Assemblywoman Gorelow would like to be considered as cosponsors as you are going through the potential amendment process.", "I would like to be included as well.", "As I said, I would encourage all Committee members, if you are interested, to please reach out to Assemblywoman Titus if you want to be included.", "Are there any additional

Association's Committee on Disability Issues in Psychology has emphasized the need to avoid offensive expressions and recommends placing people first, just as Assemblywoman Titus explained.",

we are going to describe our children's mental health consortia in Nevada and how they shape our children's mental health system [Exhibit C].", "I am going to provide a brief overview of how the consortia were established and how they function, then the chair of each consortium is going to take five minutes to describe its regional priorities and the recent impacts of the pandemic on its region.", "Here [page 3] is a brief reminder of our agency vision and mission which we talked about in detail last week.", "As you know, Nevada has a bifurcated child welfare system.", "This means that in the urban counties, the county provides child welfare services, whereas in the rest of Nevada, the Division of Child and Family Services (DCFS) is responsible for child welfare Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 15, 2021 services.", "This structure was established by Assembly Bill 1 of the 17th Special Session in response to concerns about the previous structure of the child welfare system causing interruptions and delays in services and placements, as well as delays in permanency planning which would cause the child to remain in the child welfare system for longer than necessary, among other concerns.", "When this bifurcated system was established, the bill also required the establishment of independent groups that would assess and plan for the mental health needs of children in Nevada.", "These groups are the regional children's mental health consortia established for Clark and Washoe Counties and for rural Nevada [page 4, Exhibit C].", "The consortia operate under system of core values and principles which we reviewed on Wednesday last week.", "They are family-driven and youth-guided, community-based, and culturally and linguistically appropriate.", "In 2010 and again in 2020, each consortium conducted a needs assessment in its region and submitted a ten-year strategic plan outlining the priorities for its region and the strategies that would be used to achieve its goals.", "Status updates are provided to the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and to the Commission on Behavioral Health in odd-numbered years.", "In preparing the biennial budget request for the DHHS, the Director is required to consider the consortia's priorities and any request for budget allocations.", "The Director must report to the consortia which items from their priority list were included in the Department's request and explain the reasoning for any items that were not.", "One of the features of a system of care approach is that youth and families are involved in every level of governance [page 5].", "This includes the children's mental health consortia as the entities that drive the structure of our children's mental health system.", "Each consortium has a parent of a youth with behavioral health needs as a voting member, and typically, there are several more parents and caregivers in attendance at every meeting.", "There is time set aside at each meeting to hear parent concerns.", "In addition to individuals with much experience, each consortium consists of a representative from DCFS or from the Division of Public and Behavioral Health, depending on the region, Nevada Medicaid, the region's child welfare agency, the board of trustees of the school district, the local juvenile probation department, the local business community, a provider of mental health care, a provider of foster care, and a provider of substance use treatment.", "Each consortium holds a monthly public meeting, and some of the consortia have focus work groups that also meet monthly.", "Now I will turn it over to the Washoe County consortium to go over that region's priorities.", "Jacquelyn Kleinedler, Chair, Washoe County Children's Mental Health Consortium: In March 2020, the consortium finalized its current ten-year strategic plan as required by the Nevada Revised Statutes [Exhibit D].", "We identified three overarching goals to guide our conversation, activities, advocacy, and our local and statewide data review strategies [page 6, Exhibit C].", "In our effort to begin the path toward realization of our shared vision of equitable and compassionate mental health care for all, we established our first goal to address multiple ongoing and projected community needs in the coming years.", "We have started conversations around what increased access, decreased barriers, and least restrictive environments look like, and what it would take to make resources with these characteristics Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 15, 2021 available to youth.", "Achievement of this goal requires expansion of interrelated systems from private and public service agencies.", "For example, for our school district to succeed in its efforts to colocate services in their schools and increase collaboration with community partners, multiple local and state stakeholders must work together to provide the necessary resources to meet agreed-upon objectives.", "As our discussion of goals took shape, we realized that primary, preventive support of families and caregivers in their naturally occurring and overlapping systems is necessary.", "Thus, our second goal is centered around activities that educate community stakeholders, including parents, about toxic stress, and about ways to buffer children, build resilience, and strengthen protective factors.", "The foundation of the second goal lies in the compelling research on adverse childhood experiences that documents future potential impacts of unmitigated toxic stress on children when they become adults and, potentially, parents themselves.", "Our third goal embodies our shared value that children thrive when their family is thriving, and families thrive when their community is thriving.", "With this goal, we will set out to bridge systems and identify key community factors that enhance physical and emotional health, safety, and well-being.", "Each priority on this slide [page 7, Exhibit C] brings us a step closer to achieving all three long-term goals.", "The challenges and opportunities of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to dominate our meetings, considerations, and discussions.", "We intentionally make space to hear the stories of members of our community and look for ways to amplify their voices in local and statewide advocacy.", "Through this process, we have come to understand that teachers and educators, some of the key adults who we rely upon to guide and teach our children, are themselves overwhelmed with the stressors and demands of educating during the pandemic.", "Many are experiencing what can be characterized as toxic stress.", "Thus, our attention has turned to advocacy for our educators.", "In late January, we penned a letter to the Superintendent of Public Instruction and the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services, requesting various forms of support, waiver, and relief.", "We believe that the adults who wrap love and support around our youth must also be supported.", "Alongside this effort, we continue to examine ways to shore up care of children to address increased reports of anxiety and depression in our youth and to continue to fight against our ever-existing youth suicide epidemic.", "Though the pandemic has highlighted and intensified existing disparities in Washoe County around food, housing, and employment insecurity, it has also allowed a particularly unique opportunity for adults and young people in our community to understand the importance of mental health, and through their shared experiences, to decrease the stigma around accessing mental health care.", "We hope to press on this momentum and keep the attention paid to mental health at the forefront.", "We hope to continue to normalize mental health needs and access to mental health care as a necessary function of overall well-being.", "In conclusion, I respectfully ask this Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 15, 2021 Committee to keep our children and families in mind as you continue to proceed through the 81st Session.", "Pamela Johnson, Chair, Rural Children's Mental Health Consortium: [Pamela Johnson supplied additional information not discussed Exhibit E].", "I am the parent of a child with a serious emotional disturbance.", "He received treatment for approximately six years that was very expensive and confusing.", "As a nurse, I wanted to help others experiencing the same difficulty, so I decided to volunteer with the rural consortium.", "In the last two years, the consortium has had the highest meeting participation.", "We offered a virtual platform before the pandemic and we have representation from across rural Nevada.", "The rural consortium has five goals I will briefly discuss [page 8, Exhibit C].", "The most successful effort we have made is what we refer to as community discussions.", "Before the pandemic, we held two events, one in Winnemucca and one in Tonopah.", "We asked community participants about mental health efforts in their communities.", "They addressed their successes and challenges.", "Our goals were developed around community concerns.", "Goal 1: The consortium members are participating in the DCFS Nevada System of Care Expansion Grant [Exhibit F].", "The partnership is helping to improve and expand mental health services, specifically in rural communities.", "Some of these expansions include respite care, increased psychiatric services, and early childhood mental health services.", "We also work closely with peer support groups, including Youth MOVE Nevada, National Alliance on Mental Illness, and Parents Educating Parents, Inc. Goal 2: There are limited providers in rural communities, and we facilitated partnerships such as with school social workers to promote early detection in schools.", "We have helped provide items to rural providers such as art supplies to carry out the goals of a youth's treatment plan.", "Goal 3: We are supporting the expansion and continued funding of the rural Children's Mobile Crisis Response Team.", "The service is now 24/7 and is often the point of entry for youth and families.", "In fiscal year 2021, rural mobile crisis has had an 84.3 hospital diversion rate, meaning that 84.3 of the youth we had contact with were able to be stabilized in their home communities.", "Goal 4: The consortium supported and joined the system of care in offering training to over 70 rural clinicians in becoming certified telehealth providers.", "We are also working on a plan to bring health equity training to rural communities.", "Goal 5: The consortium has completed a memorandum of understanding with the Nevada System of Care to serve as a designated point of contact for youth, families, and other provider input.", "We are also working with behavioral health policy boards in the rural and frontier counties.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 15, 2021 Regarding the impact of the pandemic, the severity of symptoms seems to have increased in 2020.", "Youth are reporting more lethal, violent, suicidal thoughts such as hanging, jumping into traffic, and firearms.", "This is possibly due to the increase in isolation, but due also to increased screen time during COVID-19 restrictions.", "Families are needing more intensive case management.", "They are struggling to provide the basic necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter, and these financial stressors are associated with COVID-19.", "For youth needing to be hospitalized for safety, rural mobile crisis reports see longer wait times in emergency rooms.", "Perhaps one of the issues is COVID-19 testing before transporting.", "A rapid test may not always be available; it would sometimes take days for test results to came back so the youth could be transported.", "Our state continues to see a shortage of acute psychiatric hospital beds, especially for youth between the ages of 5 and 15.", "Last week we had a ten-year-old who waited in the emergency room for days before a bed was available.", "Transportation continues to be an issue for rural families trying to access mental health services.", "There are some strengths.", "We have collaborated with the suicide prevention and rural mobile crisis teams.", "They have partnered to provide rural families with gun locks, medication safes, and prescription disposal bags.", "Youth are getting outpatient services more quickly with the increase in telehealth providers.", "With more mental health services needing to be done via telehealth, Medicaid has enacted an expansion that allows mental health providers to be reimbursed for telehealth and phone-health services at the same rate as inpatient services.", "This expansion has helped mental health services in rural Nevada flourish during the pandemic.", "The consortium is hopeful this expansion will continue even after the pandemic.", "It is our hope that this overview of our efforts demonstrates the importance of providing children's mental health services in all areas of the state.", "Rural areas are challenging, but the lessons of the community discussion events demonstrate the pride each community takes in their efforts with other stakeholders to provide children with the needed health care in their own communities.", "Dan Musgrove, Chair, Clark County Children's Mental Health Consortium: [Dan Musgrove submitted additional information not discussed Exhibit G].", "I have been working on mental health issues locally and with the state Legislature for over 20 years.", "I would like to call your attention to this slide, which is our strategic plan's overarching goals [page 9, Exhibit C].", "There are six of them.", "In 2001, the Legislature created the local consortiums.", "There is also a statewide consortium I work with that includes the members of both Washoe County and the rural counties.", "Much of what you have already heard from Washoe and the rurals is happening in Clark County as well, but probably to a greater degree because of our larger population.", "On this slide [page 10] is the progress being made on the top four priorities of the Clark County Consortium, and particularly on Nos.", "3 and 4.", "There is a current investigation being conducted by the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice dealing with Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 15, 2021 whether the State of Nevada is unnecessarily relying on institutionalization to treat children with behavioral health conditions.", "When you look at our Items 3 and 4, those are issues we have seen for a number of years that we believe could have helped to deal with that issue.", "The benefit of these consortiums lies in their membership, and it includes state agencies, county agencies, the school districts, and parents.", "All of them are tremendous advocates on behalf of children.", "But as we know, dealing with budgets and restrictions and sometimes just an inability to move the needle, sometimes things get out of hand, and I think we have an issue of over-hospitalization.", "Also, we do not have capacity here in the State of Nevada.", "We do not want children to have to access long-term treatment: we want to see wraparound care and mobile crisis teams\u2014those are all items we hope would keep kids out of long-term residential treatment facilities.", "However, in Clark County, we do not have a lot of beds.", "The majority of beds are in Reno or out of state which does not help kids or families at all.", "As you can see in our Items 3 and 4, we need more service array options because we have not seen progress.", "During the 2015 Session, Assembly Bill 307 of the 78th Session was passed in both houses and that attempted to address many of these issues.", "It was a pilot program that would have looked at the intensive care coordination services for children with behavioral health needs who reside in Clark and Washoe Counties.", "The funding, however, was never there, so A.B.", "307 of the 78th Session never was implemented or tried.", "Maybe we would have seen some help in those areas.", "It is all about having a complete service array to help children and families.", "Another thing the Chair wanted us to talk about was the impact of COVID-19.", "We already have a stress system that has an impact on youth and families.", "These children have experienced everything: fear, grief, loss of loved ones, anxiety about COVID-19, the issues of their own family finances, dealing with online learning, the isolation, the disrupted relationships.", "Imagine children with disabilities and mental health needs having to deal with the additional burdens of remote learning as parents and their caregivers attempt to meet their needs in a home setting, in the absence of having a lot of the necessary supports and services they normally would have.", "We have received lots of testimony from parents and mental health professionals about the methods schools are using to hold kids accountable, and it is harmful to these students.", "We see reports that schools are being punitive in the online environment.", "Students are already experiencing stress and anxiety about lower or failing grades, but they are receiving warnings that they might be retained; they are getting tired of uncomfortable screen time and threats of class failure, and threats of not even graduating.", "We in Clark County have recognized the extreme challenges faced by the children and we believe you have to work on strategic and sustained planning efforts to help develop more systems of care for these children especially.", "The effects of the pandemic will be long-lasting, especially in the absence of adequate service array, so the mental health of children and their families needs to be prioritized.", "And, above all else, compassion and understanding Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 15, 2021 are needed so students and families feel supported, rather than punished, for this situation that is not within their control.", "Chair Nguyen: When I asked the children's mental health consortia to present, I asked them to highlight some of the key issues and priorities for their regions.", "Are there any questions?", "Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: Ms. Johnson, could you send your rural consortium's list of goals, please?", "Pamela Johnson: Absolutely, we can do that.", "Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: May I have some specifics about some of what you all reported?", "When you are speaking of increases in suicidal thoughts, are these children who are already receiving services in your consortiums or are these new children who are now seeking help?", "Who is collecting and tracking this data?", "Pamela Johnson: It is all the things you have mentioned\u2014they are new, they are children in service, and they are also family members.", "We get the information from suicide prevention centers and mobile crisis units.", "Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: Is there a standard vetting procedure for this data, this intake?", "I hear about the increases, but I want to be sure we are gathering this data in a manner that is quantifiable so we can refer to it with confidence.", "Then we would be able to find resources and act on it because we have data that has been collected in a manner that is consistent with some kind of metric that is accepted in the industry.", "Jacqueline Kleinedler: One of the problems we see is the scattered approach to data collection about the topic of increased reports of anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts among youth.", "One of the ways the consortium is addressing this is to pull from multiple data sources.", "We ask different agencies in our community that work directly with youth.", "We invite them to give presentations.", "For example, the Human Services Agency of Washoe County gives presentations, The Children's Cabinet gives presentations, and Quest Counseling and Consulting gives presentations.", "We ask the school district to attend meetings, and they share information with us.", "To my knowledge, there is no standardized mechanism for collecting data.", "There is also a lag between when the data is collected and presented and when we are able to formulate a response to that information.", "Your question about data is important and an area where we Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 15, 2021 could use a lot of support in figuring out how to track, how to report, and how to respond to the trends we see.", "Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: I spoke with an organization not long ago about this issue.", "They told me they use Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data.", "Have you considered adopting that metric, that process, so that each of the organizations that are reporting to your consortium are using the same standards?", "That way we would have something consistent to refer to.", "We are hearing conflicting things.", "I am a brand new legislator; I am learning every day; but I am hearing data from one hand and then the other on an issue that is this serious and requires action.", "People from different perspectives are putting forth their data and if it is not consistently collected, I do not know if that data is being presented in a manner that is for the individual or the organization's benefit, or if it is for the benefit of all.", "I want the data I receive to be consistent, so I know how this is affecting everyone, not an organization or institute that has a motive\u2014except that they care about the kids.", "That is what I am concerned about.", "Megan Freeman: There is a survey taken here in Nevada called the \"Youth Risk Behavior Survey\" that is conducted using the CDC criteria.", "It is conducted by the University of Nevada, Reno, and in 2019 every Nevada middle and high school participated in that survey.", "That is an amazing source of data.", "I do not know whether any other places try to survey every eligible youth in a state.", "They will start data collection on the 2021 survey in the fall.", "It was scheduled for the spring, but was pushed back due to the pandemic.", "I would be happy to make sure you have a copy of some of the recent findings from that survey.", "I also want to talk about data from different agencies, including children's mobile response.", "Usually that is data that is collected in the course of routine clinical care.", "Typically, that is collected in a different way for a different purpose than epidemiological data, like what is collected by the CDC, and so the questions will be asked in a slightly different way because it is done for a different purpose.", "There are complementary approaches, and we want to make sure to use both so we have a comprehensive understanding of the problem and how to address it.", "Chair Nguyen: If there is any additional information, please get that to Patrick Ashton so he can distribute it to the entire Committee.", "Assemblywoman Titus: Thank you for your presentations.", "I appreciate all you are doing, all you are trying to do, and the challenges ahead of you.", "I want to make sure all the consortiums, Washoe, rural, and Clark, are communicating with the other mental health consortiums so that we are not operating in silos.", "I have not heard of any joint ventures.", "I would like to know that you are communicating with the other behavioral health care boards, the other mental health boards, and not living in separate silos.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 15, 2021 Dan Musgrove: I can speak on behalf of Clark and some of the other consortiums.", "As you know, we are advocates for children and we have a responsibility to prepare these reports.", "We provide them to both the Commission on Behavioral Health as well as to Director Whitley of the DHHS.", "Two other members of the Clark consortium and I also serve on the Clark County Regional Behavioral Health Policy Board.", "A number of the other regional policy boards have ceded the work on children to the consortiums, and we report what we are doing to the regional behavioral health policy boards.", "That way, they are not doing the same work we are doing.", "We do have a statewide children's consortium where we all come together.", "You are absolutely right.", "We want to make sure there are no silos and all of us are working off the same sheet of music.", "Assemblywoman Titus: I just want to make sure there is not duplication of effort because we have such a limited supply of funds and volunteers.", "We need to make sure we are all working together and that it is a joint venture for all Nevadans.", "On the Washoe County consortium's presentation, they mentioned toxic stress.", "In my experience, we are getting away from those terms and using something called ACEs\u2014adverse childhood experiences.", "Have we seen a resurgence of toxic stresses with the current COVID-19 pandemic, or is that still something that has morphed into this more general term for adverse childhood experiences?", "Jacquelyn Kleinedler: Those two concepts are complementary.", "When we are describing toxic stress in our ten-year plan and in our forward goals, what we are talking about is the stressors children face that are chronic, ongoing, and that require buffering, resiliency factors, or protective factors to be introduced in order to prevent that toxic stress from creating long-term effects for that child.", "When we talk about adverse childhood experiences, we are referring specifically to the standardized or the most normative ACE screening tool.", "That has been used in research as the correlative factor for ongoing problems for adults ranging from health to mental health to substance use to parenting issues.", "Assemblywoman Titus: For Committee members who may not know, the toxic stress rankings came out in around 2010 and involve positive stresses, tolerable stresses, and toxic stresses.", "Right now, I think Assemblywoman Gorelow: I have a question regarding the limited number of beds we have for the children.", "What happens if the children have to be hospitalized?", "Where do they go once we run out of those beds?", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 15, 2021 Megan Freeman: Occasionally, they have to stay in the emergency room or a medical hospital, and sometimes they do go out of state.", "Assemblywoman Gorelow: Do you have an estimate of how many children are being sent out of state, and by out of state, are we talking about Arizona, California, or Utah, or are they going to Kansas or Texas?", "Megan Freeman: Typically, whoever places the youth tries to keep them as close to home as possible.", "Many youth do go to Utah and Arizona.", "We have that data publicly available, and we can get that to you to make sure you have all the information in detail.", "Chair Nguyen: Thank you for your presentations.", "If any Committee members have any follow-up questions, comments, or concerns, please follow up with our individual speakers.", "With that, I will move on to our next presentation\u2014an overview of Medicaid.", "Suzanne Bierman, Administrator, Division of Health Care Financing and Policy, Department of Health and Human Services: Thank you for the opportunity to present a very high-level overview of Nevada Medicaid and its relationship to the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services (DWSS).", "Today, we will be presenting an overview of Medicaid, how it works, the eligibility process, how it is delivered, a description of some of the benefits and services that are provided, how the federal and state programs work together, and how that works out for Nevadans, the state, hospitals, doctors, and others [page 2, Exhibit H].", "Medicaid is the state's largest insurer and provides significant funding for hospitals, Federally Qualified Health Centers, nursing homes, and many other health care providers.", "Robert Thompson, Deputy Administrator, Division of Welfare and Supportive Services, Department of Health and Human Services: This is a joint presentation because DWSS operates the application and eligibility side of Nevada Medicaid for thousands of Nevadans a year [page 3].", "Once a person is found eligible, we transmit that data, and our partners at Nevada Medicaid take over.", "Suzanne Bierman: The Division of Health Care Financing and Policy (DHCFP) is payor.", "We currently are serving over 810,000 Nevadans, a significant increase from pre-COVID-19 days.", "Medicaid is a health insurance program.", "It provides coverage for low-income children and adults, seniors, and people with disabilities.", "In challenging economic times, Medicaid provides temporary help for people who lose their jobs or become too sick to work.", "All Nevadans who meet eligibility requirements are guaranteed coverage under Medicaid.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 15, 2021 Nevada Medicaid functions in many ways like commercial insurance.", "We enroll providers, process and pay claims, provide oversight of provider billing, and monitor utilization and management, just to name a few activities.", "The Division currently has a little over 300 employees.", "This is a slide we often use [page 4, Exhibit H].", "We think it is important and provides a high-level overview of some of the impacts of the program for Nevadans.", "As I mentioned, we have seen such an increase in our enrollment that Nevada Medicaid now covers one in four Nevadans.", "When I did this presentation two years ago, that figure was one in five.", "Nevada Medicaid makes up a large percentage of the state budget at nearly 30 percent of state expenditures.", "We cover a lot.", "Sixty percent of the births in the state are covered by Medicaid, and it is also the single largest payor of nursing home care and long-term services.", "I want to note that Nevada Medicaid covers services that are not always covered by other commercial insurance programs or even Medicare.", "Back to the point about Nevada Medicaid being the primary payor for long-term care services, that is because many other commercial insurance programs and, outside of a certain day limitation, Medicare, do not reimburse for those services.", "So this is just another way Medicaid serves as a safety net for the state.", "Our enrollment has definitely changed due to the public health emergency in the COVID-19 pandemic.", "I will spend some time on this slide, which is prepandemic, but it points out that Nevada has a higher rate of uninsured than the average across the United States [page 5].", "While we note that this has changed during the pandemic, I think it is important to note that, historically, Nevada has had a higher rate of uninsured compared to the rest of the nation.", "This slide shows our current Medicaid caseload as of January 2021 and the trends over the course of the last year [page 6].", "You can see that uptick due to the COVID-19 public health emergency, and you can see that we have continued to see increases in our enrollment, but not at as such a steep rate as earlier in 2020.", "These sorts of increases in the Medicaid program as the economy worsens are not surprising.", "Medicaid is what is called a counter-cyclical program.", "That means when the economy worsens, its caseload goes up.", "We are certainly seeing that here, and it is an expected trend in Medicaid programs as states face tough economic times.", "A piece of federal legislation passed in early 2020 has some implications for our caseload, and that is the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA), which has brought some additional federal funding to the state.", "However, along with that has come maintenance of effort requirements for eligibility.", "That requires continuous Medicaid eligibility during the time of the public health emergency.", "We expect to see these types of trends continue as the economy worsens.", "Another contributing factor to our increasing caseload is due to that requirement of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.", "Almost half of our recipients are parents and children, then adults, and about 20 percent are in other eligibility categories, including individuals with disabilities.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 15, 2021 Robert Thompson: Information on the next few slides shows how Nevadans access Medicaid.", "They apply to Medicaid through processes within DWSS [page 7].", "You might wonder why there are two different state divisions that administer Medicaid.", "It is common in other states to see one state agency that handles both the eligibility determinations for the public, and that works for the payors; however, in Nevada, DWSS does more than just determine eligibility for Medicaid.", "Nevada is somewhat unique in our approach to administering Medicaid.", "Often in states where Medicaid is a single agency, there are other, separate agencies for social services that serve similar populations.", "In other states, a person in need would be required to travel to one government office or agency to apply for food assistance such as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), which is welfare, and then travel to another agency to apply for Medicaid.", "In the early 1990s, Nevada integrated these systems to remove the administrative burden from the public and put the burden on the state to provide one streamlined process to access multiple benefits to persons or families who need it.", "In Nevada, we have organized our access so that several other major social services programs can be accessed at the same entry point.", "These other programs include SNAP, TANF, our energy assistance program, and our child care development program.", "In addition to administering these programs, the Division is the state-level child support enforcement authority, and we have provided administrative support to the homeless housing board commission.", "This was done in an effort to create a one-stop shop for persons in need.", "While many people receiving Medicaid, SNAP, and TANF can and do work, for those who are not employed, the Division administers workforce development programs to create pathways for people so they can improve their potential and contribute to their communities.", "For individuals on SNAP, the workforce program is called SNAP Employment and Training, or you may hear us refer to it as SNAP E&T.", "For individuals on TANF, the workforce development is called New Employees in Nevada, also referred to as NEON.", "You might imagine that, with the additional programming features and the complexity of Medicaid's financial employment obligations, it became necessary to divide the duties for Medicaid and its two different divisions.", "That change was made by the Nevada Legislature in the 1990s.", "There are two ways to apply for Medicaid [page 8].", "The first way is through referrals, and the majority of our referrals come from Nevada Health Link, also referred to as the health exchange.", "Nevada Health Link reviews all marketplace applications because if anyone applying for coverage may be eligible for Medicaid or Nevada Check Up, depending on income limits, and if an applicant appears to be eligible for Medicaid, the application is referred to us for processing with no additional application required from the person applying.", "These applicants then receive correspondence about their case from us.", "The reason there is no additional and separate application required is because the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) required a streamlined application process for Medicaid coverage.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 15, 2021 Another referral system is for hospitals to apply on behalf of a patient, and a hospital can get benefits through what is known as hospital presumptive eligibility.", "This method does require people to follow through with an additional regular application if they want to maintain their coverage.", "There are additional quality control measures that the welfare division puts in place to make sure those claims are being paid appropriately and are not fraudulent.", "Customers can also apply directly with us.", "We refer to this as click-in, call-in, mail-in, or come-in.", "We encourage all our customers to apply online through Access Nevada.", "It is the most efficient system for them and us.", "But customers can also verbally apply over the phone to our call center.", "A lot of people do not know that.", "With Medicaid, we have an approved waiver for the person to verbally apply and verbally sign the application over the phone.", "There may be additional paperwork to do, but that initial application can be done verbally.", "We receive applications via mail or through our drop boxes, and the final method is in person, which, obviously, was pre-COVID-19.", "Either in our DWSS offices or as part of growing outreach initiatives, we have set up many access points that are nontraditional such as in homeless shelters, family court, community centers, and, in some cases, even in detention centers.", "We plan to reactivate those, post-COVID-19.", "Once DWSS has received the application for assistance, we have to evaluate the household circumstances to determine if they are eligible [page 9, Exhibit H].", "Medicaid is approved at no cost, while Nevada Check Up has quarterly premiums.", "The primary eligibility determinations look at gross income, citizenship, household composition, residency, and, in some cases depending on the program being applied for, we have to look at their resources and assets.", "Those are primary eligibility reasons; there are multiple factors in eligibility.", "This slide also includes a snapshot of eligible income categories.", "Taking a household of one for example, if we were looking at a single adult without children, not pregnant, and not disabled, if that person's income level fell within 138 percent of poverty, so as long as the individual is making under $1,483 a month, that person would be eligible for Medicaid.", "A second example could be a single parent with two children\u2014so a household of three.", "Because there are children in the home, we would look at 205 percent of poverty, so that family could have up to $3,752 of gross monthly income and remain eligible for Medicaid assistance and that 205 percent is for Nevada Check Up.", "At this point, our agency would approve the case, transmit the data to Nevada Medicaid, and they would take over the case from there.", "They would issue the Medicaid cards and would become the enroller and the payor.", "Suzanne Bierman: As was mentioned, once DWSS has approved an application for Medicaid, DHCFP begins the Medicaid enrollment process.", "Nevada Medicaid uses two different service delivery models\u2014managed care and fee-for-service [page 10].", "Managed care is the primary model, covering 72 percent of the recipients in the state.", "It is available in the urban counties of Clark and Washoe, and to all eligibility groups except for the aged, blind, and disabled.", "Nevada Medicaid currently contracts with three managed care organizations (MCOs) to Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 15, 2021 provide care under this model.", "Individuals can choose among these three organizations as part of their eligibility application process, and the selected managed care organization will then provide a welcome packet with information about insurance coverage to the Nevada Medicaid member.", "In the instance that a recipient does not choose among the three MCOs, there is a process for auto-assigning those members to one of the three MCO plans.", "Fee-for-service is the other service delivery model that is used by Nevada Medicaid.", "In this model, DHCFP performs many of the same functions and activities as a commercial insurance plan would, such as provider enrollment and claims processing.", "Fee-for-service covers Nevadans in rural areas and the aged, blind, and disabled population.", "On this slide, we have an overview of some of the benefits and services provided by Nevada Medicaid [page 11].", "This is not the full list and is just for illustrative purposes and to describe one element of the federal-state framework.", "The program, of course, is jointly administered between the state and the federal government, and certain services are mandatory and must be provided by all states.", "Other services are optional.", "The mandatory/optional service set up in the Medicaid program accounts for one of the reasons you see variation in Medicaid programs across states.", "As I said, this is not a full list, but I wanted to note this mandatory/optional distinction.", "Nevada Medicaid does provide comprehensive coverage for children.", "The benefit for children is what we refer to as EPSDT, which is early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment services.", "For the Medicaid expansion adults, Nevada Medicaid does cover the ten essential health benefits.", "Those are the same benefits that the ACA required to be covered by Nevada Health Link, so there is some continuity of coverage as individuals have changes in their income and may transition from Medicaid to exchange coverage or vice versa.", "In addition to those benefits, Medicaid also provides coverage for some services and benefits that other commercial insurers typically do not cover.", "An example of that is nonemergency medical transportation and long-term care.", "There is also a link here to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) website for the full listing of mandatory and optional services.", "We often get questions concerning why Medicaid had not paid for a particular service, so I wanted to go over the four high-level requirements for Medicaid reimbursement [page 12].", "When Medicaid pays for services for Medicaid-eligible and enrolled individuals, only providers who are enrolled in Medicaid will be reimbursed.", "Also, it must be a Medicaid-covered service, which goes back to that optional list.", "Is this a service that is included in Medicaid's benefit package?", "Last, is the service medically necessary?", "I want to talk about the program's overall authority and how it is jointly administered between the federal and state governments [page 13, Exhibit H].", "The federal agency with whom we work closely to administer this program is CMS.", "To qualify for federal matching funds, states must operate their Medicaid program in accordance with federal law and must file a state plan and state plan amendment with CMS.", "The state plan is basically the contract between the state and the federal government that describes how the state administers its Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 15, 2021 Medicaid program.", "It outlines the state rules and operating protocols for program administration.", "It is the primary authority that governs Medicaid services.", "However, waivers are also available to states when they need additional flexibility beyond what is available in state plan authority to design their programs.", "As an example, Nevada has three program waivers which are 1915(c) home- and community-based waivers that allow Nevada to offer home- and community-based services as an alternative to care in facilities.", "These waivers allow the state to impose limits on program enrollment that are otherwise not allowable under state plan authority.", "Those are jointly operated by the Aging and Disability Services Division with oversight responsibility by DHCFP.", "In addition to program waivers there are also options for research and demonstration waivers, often referred to as Section 1115 waivers.", "These waivers allow states to test program features that are otherwise not provided for or allowed under federal Medicaid law.", "These Section 1115 research and demonstration waivers must advance the objectives of the Medicaid program and are subject to stringent budget neutrality requirements that require actuarial analysis.", "They are generally approved for five years.", "If you think of this as a continuum between the standard and something that would be more of an exception to the general rule, you have state plan and then program waivers, and then there are Section 1115 research and demonstration waivers when the state needs to work with the federal government to try to design a program to meet state needs in a new and innovative way.", "Here is a little information about how the program is jointly administered [page 14].", "The federal government pays for the majority of the cost of the Medicaid program in Nevada.", "Medicaid is typically the single largest source of federal aid to the states.", "The federal government matches state Medicaid spending on an open-ended basis.", "The diagram here demonstrates how this works with the fee-for-service model where the federal government and the state pay providers.", "In the managed care model, the funding comes from the state and federal government to the MCOs, and those organizations then pay the providers.", "This slide shows something you will hear a lot about\u2014FMAP, which is the federal medical assistance percentage [page 15].", "This is additional information on the percentage of the overall Medicaid program that is paid for with federal funds.", "Across all the Division's services, the federal government is paying anywhere from 64 percent up to 92 percent of the costs.", "You can also see on this chart that two of the rows in this table show \"with FFCRA.\"", "That is the federal legislation I mentioned earlier when talking about enrollment that has some implications related to maintenance of effort, requirements for eligibility, along with the enhanced funding you can see on the slide.", "I will also note that this enhanced funding under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act is tied to the time frame of the public health emergency, so Nevada Medicaid is getting enhanced federal funding throughout the public health emergency.", "It has to be updated quarterly whether or not the public health emergency will continue to be extended.", "The Biden Administration recently sent a letter to governors stating that it understood the need for predictability around the timing of the public health emergency and indicating its intention of continuing the public health emergency at Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 15, 2021 least through calendar year 2021.", "It also indicated that it would provide states with 60 days advance notice before termination of the public health emergency.", "In summary, I want to note again that during this time of a global health pandemic, Nevadans are increasingly relying on Medicaid.", "It is the state's health insurance program for low-income Nevadans, and it is a safety net during tough economic times.", "Medicaid provides comprehensive coverage and financial protection for many Nevadans.", "We do this through partnership with the federal government and providers, and there are a number of additional resources on our website as listed on this slide [page 17].", "Chair Nguyen: Are there questions?", "Assemblywoman Gorelow: Going back to where you list the federal poverty levels for the Medicaid program [page 9, Exhibit H], are those poverty levels across all states?", "How do they compare to other states?", "Robert Thompson: Those poverty levels are provided by the federal government to all states and are based on federal poverty guidelines.", "Assemblywoman Gorelow: How are those amounts determined when someone is applying for eligibility?", "Robert Thompson: It depends on the program.", "For most programs, we take the current circumstances and project the future circumstances and determine what their income will be on a month-to-month basis.", "If a person was working this month, their income was stable, everything was normal, and they were making under a certain amount, we would approve them.", "If they go over this amount this month, but they have verification with them showing that their income has stopped, that they have recently lost a job, then we would project that the income had stopped.", "We are consistently looking at what the current circumstances are and what the future projected circumstances are.", "That is not true in some of the medical assistance rates or the aged, blind, or disabled programs.", "Some of those programs use actual income on a retroactive basis.", "Assemblywoman Gorelow: How often do you redetermine someone's eligibility?", "Robert Thompson: Pre-COVID-19, we determined eligibility annually for all our programs.", "Customers are required to report to us if there is a change in circumstances.", "If their income is to go up, they are required to report that, but we do touch base and do a full analysis at least once a year.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 15, 2021 Assemblyman Matthews: For a few months we have been trending up.", "Most economic indicators are starting to move in the right direction, and we are seeing state unemployment rates go down consistently month after month.", "Are there any internal projections about when and where those caseload numbers may finally peak?", "When may we see some movement in the other direction as things start to stabilize further in our economy?", "Suzanne Bierman: It is difficult to predict, and we do work closely with DHCFP's office of analytics.", "They work on predicting and projecting caseloads for the department.", "We have met with them recently to take into account the recent news from the Biden Administration that they do plan to continue extending the public health emergency throughout the course of this calendar year.", "For that reason, we think that we will continue to see pretty high caseloads through 2021.", "Certainly, all of the maintenance of effort for eligibility protections that come along with the FFCRA will be in place through that time period.", "So, we plan to see our current levels stay about where they are\u2014the same steady increase, but not back to early 2020 rates.", "However, we do not anticipate seeing any dramatic decreases at least through the period of the public health emergency.", "Assemblywoman Titus: You continue to show increases in Medicaid applicants and potential recipients [page 6, Exhibit H].", "My question is, where is the slide that shows that you have an increase in Medicaid providers?", "Cody Phinney, Deputy Administrator, Division of Health Care Financing and Policy, Department of Health and Human Services: We have done some research on that for our provider enrollment unit.", "We are seeing some increase in providers and would be happy to send that data over to you.", "It was actually more encouraging than I expected it to be.", "As you know, people are losing their employment and therefore their health insurance, but we were not expecting that more providers would be coming here.", "I can only attribute it to the fact that there are more people whose costs are reimbursable by our program; therefore, perhaps, providers are interested in participating more fully.", "Assemblywoman Titus: I am sure the Chair and the whole Committee would like to see that too.", "I have frequently referred the increase in Medicaid applicants to \"giving out more bus passes but no more buses,\" so it is great to hear that there may be a shift in the positive direction.", "I am also interested in access to care and how long are people waiting to get an appointment with a provider, so if you could send the Committee that data, we would like that too because it is all relevant.", "Presumptive eligibility was mentioned and all the criteria for that [page 8].", "I think I heard you say that citizenship was a criteria, even including presumptive eligibility?", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 15, 2021 Robert Thompson: When I was listing the eligibility criteria, I was meaning the five main criteria that can impact eligibility.", "There are two dozen Medicaid programs we trickle down through, and citizenship impacts coverage type as we move through those.", "I did not mean to imply that citizenship would turn on or turn off full eligibility, but it is one of those things we evaluate, and it does impact the type of cases that we can approve.", "Assemblywoman Titus: One of my biggest concerns, and I think others share this concern, are disparities in health care and especially sometimes in the prenatal realm and pregnancy issues.", "When you mentioned that they could sign up over the phone, I am concerned about that access and wanting to make sure that that application process is bilingual.", "Do they have other interpreters?", "I want to make sure it is available to all the folks who truly need it and are eligible.", "Robert Thompson: Previously, we utilized case managers who were bilingual, and what we found was that we could not keep the call-wait times equal if we had too many callers who spoke Spanish and not enough agents that day.", "We have a very efficient internal translation team that can connect our case manager with the translation team that speaks Spanish at any time with no wait, so the waits are the same.", "We also have a contract with an outside agency that will connect with just about any language.", "Sometimes that has to be scheduled ahead of time.", "Assemblywoman Titus: Excellent.", "That is critical; thank you for making that happen.", "That is very encouraging.", "Chair Nguyen: When you are looking at the eligibility rates and income, how often do participants have to have that eligibility reassessed?", "Robert Thompson: When we approve a person for Medicaid, we notify them that if their income increases above a particular amount\u2014and we give them the amount\u2014they are required to notify us by the fifth of the following month of that change so we can reevaluate the case.", "Whether we hear from a customer or not, we are required to do a full, new, reconfirming application annually to verify all income and nonincome criteria to make sure the household still meets eligibility.", "So, at least once a year.", "Chair Nguyen: I have another question that comes from a constituent who is a provider.", "I have been watching him go through the process of applying to be approved by Medicaid as a provider.", "How long does that process usually take?", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 15, 2021 Cody Phinney: The process to become a provider for Medicaid in Nevada is a little bit complex because of our two different delivery models.", "The mechanism Nevada uses to meet the regulations that require the state to monitor our providers is we have everyone enrolled in our Nevada Medicaid Program\u2014so every provider who wants to be reimbursed for any services through our regular program, which is our fee-for-service enrollment.", "If the provider also wants to participate with our MCOs, then those MCOs do an additional credentialling process.", "Some states do that in a centralized way where it is one process.", "In Nevada, we have them separated.", "The enrollment into our fee-for-service program is within five days once we get all the information that is needed by

agency and your Committee to meet in the middle.", "Chair Nguyen: Thank you, Mr. Cohen.", "If you want to wait on the line until public comment, that would be more appropriate unless you have any direct comments in neutral for this bill.", "At this time, I will turn it back over to the bill presenters.", "Do you have any closing statements?", "Rique Robb: I just want to thank you for the opportunity to present A.B.", "35 and we look forward to working with you all through this process.", "Chair Nguyen: If Committee members have any follow-up questions after the close of this hearing

you might have.", "With that, I will close the hearing on A.B.", "35 and open the hearing on Assembly Bill 119.", "I believe Committee staff sent out documentation from the 2019 Session that created

can find on the Nevada Electronic Legislative Information System.", "First, you will find a link to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report on racial/ethnic disparities in pregnancy-related deaths [Exhibit D].", "Please take a look at the tables on pages 763-764.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 22, 2021 Additionally, Kyra Morgan, State Biostatistician from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), submitted an exhibit with additional information on disparate impacts of maternal morbidity and maternal mortality on people of color [Exhibit E].", "Both Ms. Morgan and her colleague, Vickie Ives, Section Manager of Maternal, Child and Adolescent Health at DHHS, will be available to respond to any questions later.", "In 2019, the Nevada Legislature clearly recognized unnecessarily high rates of maternal mortality in the state when it established the Maternal Mortality Review Committee, in short, MMRC.", "At the time, Nevada was one of only a handful of states without an MMRC.", "These committees identify and review maternal mortality\u2014a maternal death that happens within one year of pregnancy\u2014as well as trends in severe maternal morbidity, or significant complications that arise from a birth but do not lead to death.", "Based on these reviews, the MMRC is tasked with developing recommendations to prevent maternal mortality and morbidity and disseminating them to health care providers and the public.", "Not much has changed since 2019.", "Maternal mortality rates remain high in the United States and Nevada.", "Nationwide, an estimated 700 women die of pregnancy-related causes each year, and 65,000 women experience serious health complications\u2014rates nearly double those of other industrialized countries.", "Today, I bring A.B.", "119 before you to acknowledge and begin to address a significant issue that is also deeply personal: racial and ethnic disparities in maternal and infant mortality.", "While Black women make up 11 percent of Nevada's population, they account for 33 percent of pregnancy-related deaths.", "Native-American women represent just over 2 percent of the state population and account for 22 percent of pregnancy-related deaths.", "Rates of severe maternal morbidity among Black, Asian-Pacific- Islander, and Native-American women are similarly stark, at twice the rate of white women.", "Similar disparities exist for infants of color.", "Black infants and Native Hawaiian/Pacific- Islander infants are more than twice as likely to die as white or Hispanic infants.", "Infant mortality rates for Native-American and Native-Alaskan infants are not far behind.", "Assembly Bill 119 aims to address this unacceptable reality by requiring the MMRC to collect data to quantify and measure disparities in the incidence of maternal mortality and preventable infant deaths affecting people of color in Nevada, and it requires a summary of this data to be included in the MMRC's biennial report.", "It is my hope in proposing this bill that the MMRC collects the data it needs to take a deeper look at these very real issues and provide concrete policy recommendations to reduce disparities that we can implement to protect and improve the lives of Nevadans.", "I do not have any amendments to present to you today, but I am working with stakeholders for a possible amendment to the bill.", "I will make sure to share any possible amendments with you prior to a work session.", "Now, I would like to hand it over to my daughter, Edina, who will share

arrival.", "I had been ill most of the time but would just chalk it up to morning sickness.", "I started noticing a lot of swelling in my feet and ankles and would always ask my obstetrician (OB) if this was normal.", "He would brush it off and say that it was probably hereditary: \"My mom got swollen when she was pregnant.", "That is why.\"", "Those were his words.", "That always seemed off to me because, as a new mom, I was reading everything and it did not sound normal, but he was my OB and he went to medical school, so I just listened.", "It was not until about two weeks before my due date that someone finally noticed something was wrong.", "I was under the care of another nurse practitioner because mine had left to go on vacation.", "While seeing someone new worried me, she became one of my biggest blessings.", "We asked if my swelling was normal and she automatically said no and ordered blood work and a 24-hour urine test.", "The next day I received a call that I had preeclampsia and I needed to proceed to the hospital and start the process of delivery right away.", "They let me try as long as possible to deliver on my own, but ultimately my blood pressure rose too high and our healthy baby girl was delivered via C-section.", "If it had not been for the care and quick thinking of my new nurse practitioner, I would have been in grave danger, and I was told that on many occasions.", "I went on to have another healthy baby with no complications in 2010 and what I thought was a perfect delivery, until I got pregnant with my third child in 2013.", "We found out this one was a boy and were very excited.", "Once again, I had been extremely sick, but other than that, all seemed well until an ultrasound revealed I had placenta previa.", "As a precaution, I was to be monitored every two weeks.", "At 27 weeks, I suddenly heard a pop, which was followed by a lot of pain.", "My husband decided I needed to go to the hospital where lots of tests were run and there was a lot of head-scratching, trying to figure out what was wrong.", "I started early labor, but they were able to control that with medication.", "Early in the morning, my high-risk doctor had called to check on me.", "She told the nurses that she was going to come in because she was concerned that I had been bleeding internally.", "Everything after that is a blur, but I was told that my uterus had ruptured due to a prior poor surgical procedure with my second child.", "My operating room (OR) doctor was very angry and said it was a miracle that I had lived.", "I had lost over two liters of blood and needed several transfusions, but ultimately, my baby boy was kept safe by my having placenta previa to protect him.", "Other than an early delivery, he has grown into a very spunky child with no signs of developmental issues.", "Due to the work of my OR doctors, I was able to get pregnant one last time, and I delivered another healthy baby girl who is now approaching her nine-month mark.", "I am thankful for the doctors who did not push my concerns aside and provided proper care.", "Thank you for your time and your willingness to listen to my story.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 22, 2021 Chair Nguyen: Thank you for sharing your story.", "Personal stories like this touch home and remind us why we are doing what we are doing here today.", "Are there any further remarks or would you like to take questions?", "Assemblywoman Thomas: Yes, I am ready to answer any questions Committee members may have.", "Assemblywoman Gorelow: This is such an important issue.", "I worked for the March of Dimes for 15 years, and hearing this story gets my heart.", "Would you be willing to do an amendment to add me onto this bill?", "Assemblywoman Thomas: Yes.", "Assemblywoman Gorelow: I have a question in section 1 at lines 19 through 22 where the language talks about collecting information on preventable infant deaths as well.", "Will this morph into the fetal infant mortality review as well and combine the two programs?", "Assemblywoman Thomas: Yes, that is what the bill would include.", "I would like to turn this over to DHHS.", "I believe they have some information that would clearly address your question.", "Vickie Ives, Section Manager, Maternal, Child and Adolescent Health, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services: We have one fetal infant mortality review committee in the state, and that is in Washoe County.", "There is no statewide fetal infant mortality review, but maternal mortality review committees review the maternal mortality and then the fetal infant mortality reviews look at that as infant and fetal demise and how to prevent them.", "In terms of a statewide fetal infant mortality review, there is not one currently, just the Washoe County Health District one specifically for that county.", "However, there is a network of child death reviews within the different counties and they do consider all child fatalities, including infants\u2014which is birth to one year\u2014within their scope.", "The Maternal Mortality Review Committee does not review infant deaths.", "Assemblywoman Thomas: When I said there were amendments being worked on with stakeholders, that would also include that information.", "It is necessary to get both data, especially when we are losing Black and Brown and indigenous children along with their mothers.", "So it is important for us to get that data.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 22, 2021 Assemblywoman Gorelow: Thank you for that clarification.", "I was curious if this was going to encompass both programs into one.", "I was aware that there was a Fetal Infant Mortality Review (FIMR) in Washoe.", "Because this language says adding in the preventable infant deaths as well, I was not sure if you were looking at establishing a FIMR statewide as well or if it would be encompassed within the maternal review.", "Assemblywoman Thomas: We can look into that.", "Assemblyman Matthews: I have a question regarding section 1, subsection 1, paragraph (c), subparagraph (2).", "How would the term \"persons of color\" be defined for the purposes of this bill?", "Assemblywoman Thomas: It is incumbent upon us to clarify that we are looking specifically for the terminology of Black women and Brown women and indigenous women.", "For so long we have encountered the term \"women of color\" and we want to specify those women of color.", "Chair Nguyen: Ms. O'Krent, do you know if there is a definition that defines that in statute or common or case law?", "Karly O'Krent, Committee Counsel: There is not a definition of \"persons of color\" with regard to Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 442 that I am aware of.", "Often, we refer to Black, indigenous, and people of color throughout the NRS, so I am happy to add a definition if that is something the Committee would be interested in doing when we craft an amendment for this bill.", "Assemblywoman Peters: In that same section, is there an available definition for \"preventable infant deaths\"?", "Karly O'Krent: There is not an available definition for \"preventable infant deaths.\"", "If it is the pleasure of the Committee, that could be fleshed out further so that whoever is examining preventable infant deaths would be able to identify what might fall under that category.", "For example, is it an infant death that is somehow associated with the maternal mortality itself, or is it an infant death that is unrelated to the death of the mother of the child?", "Assemblywoman Krasner: Thank you, Assemblywoman Thomas, for bringing this bill.", "I was wondering if I, too, could please be added as a cosponsor of this legislation.", "Assemblywoman Thomas: Yes, I appreciate that.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 22, 2021 Assemblywoman Titus: I am a proud supporter of this bill and was happy to sign on when asked because I think it falls right in line with our push to make sure we can fix any disparities in health care in the state that we can.", "How can we fix them if we do not know where they are or where they start?", "My question concerns clarifying section 1, subsection 2.", "As Assemblywoman Peters asked, I, too, would like to see somewhere in writing the \"preventable infant deaths\" defined, whether it is a therapeutic abortion someone has that might be preventable\u2014if something was born at 27 weeks, it is certainly a viable child born alive and we were able to save that child\u2014maybe we do not want to get into the weeds on this, but I think we need some clarification on what is a \"preventable\" death.", "If that baby dies intrauterine because you have preeclampsia and then went into eclampsia, that is a preventable death.", "However, we know some infants have health issues.", "We know that about one-third of all pregnancies end up in a miscarriage because those infants were not viable.", "So I think if we could tease some of that out.", "Maybe it is impossible, and we will have to leave it the way it is, but I would appreciate giving some thought to that.", "This is really about where Assemblywoman Peters was going with it and having a definition on what is a \"preventable infant death\" for some clarity, because there could be arguments on both sides.", "We want this bill to go forward, so I would like to make sure we have that clarified.", "Assemblywoman Peters: I have a follow-up comment.", "I do not want to belabor the point, but we really appreciate this bill.", "I think it is one of the most important things we could be doing for women of color and equity issues.", "I want to ensure that as we look towards definitions and how we establish the data collection, that we are engaging physicians who focus on communities of color and ensure that we are defining these particular issues as they relate to the community that we are specifically addressing in this bill.", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: Will you put on the legislative record the specific data that you would hope to collect?", "The Committee has the power to subpoena and it is able to\u2014is designed to\u2014look at this in a clinical way, subject to the purview of the open meeting law, and there is confidentiality surrounding that.", "Knowing that, there are lots of protections around making sure that this data does stay in a clinical purview.", "For the legislative record, as the Committee moves forward, what would be your hope for the additional types of data you would either like to collect or see teased out?", "Assemblywoman Thomas: I wish I could answer that.", "We are set to have a meeting this week with the stakeholders to go over information that will be pertinent to this bill and any amendments to it.", "So, unfortunately, I am not able to answer your question directly.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 22, 2021 Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: That is great because we know that oftentimes\u2014and this concerns legislative intent\u2014if we are not talking with stakeholders, our legislative intent may not match up.", "What we think is really easy to get, stakeholders just look at us cross-eyed.", "I think it is wonderful, and I guess we will see that language come down the road.", "Chair Nguyen: Are there further questions from the Committee?", "[There were none.]", "I know Assemblywoman Thomas is continuing to work on this.", "We all probably agree that we want to get it right if we are going to pass this, and I know she will continue to work with those stakeholders, taking into consideration

gave the states an option to opt out.", "This bill would trigger the opt-out feature for Nevada.", "Currently in Nevada when a felon is looking to obtain benefits, that individual has to provide documentation.", "Some of us have a hard time keeping track of our library cards, so anyone with a conviction after August 22, 1996, would have to provide that certificate.", "As there has been time

"In 2021, 30.8 percent of Nevadans are food-insecure.", "Some of that has to do with the fact that Nevada never fully recovered from the recession of 2008, and some of that has to do with the fact

in the Union also happens to be one of the states that implements the ban, and that is Mississippi.", "On line with Florida, Tennessee, and Alabama, these states in the last year have all moved over to implement a partial ban, but the states that have some sort of ban are definitely some of the states with the highest food insecurity rates.", "North Carolina is the only state left in the Union with a full ban.", "There are 25 states that have completely lifted the ban, which is what we are doing with this bill.", "What the bill accomplishes is pretty straightforward.", "It removes the requirement to provide any type of documentation for substance abuse treatment, and it removes one of the last Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 24, 2021 barriers that anyone in Nevada would need to get food assistance.", "People with substance abuse convictions are the only ones who are prohibited from accessing these benefits.", "No other class of criminal conduct is prohibited under U.S. law or Nevada law.", "In 2017, one of the biggest reasons we decided to rethink this barrier is that it disproportionately discriminates against minorities.", "Black men are six times as likely to be incarcerated as white men and Hispanic men are, and Hispanic men are 2.7 times as likely to be convicted as white men are.", "For Black men in their thirties, about one in twelve is in prison or in jail on any given day.", "Women are now the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population who are being convicted for substance abuse offenses.", "More than 61 percent of women who are doing time in federal prison right now are in for nonviolent drug offenses.", "Women, and particularly women of color, are disproportionately affected by the social stigma, by plea bargaining agreement systems that punish those who are unable or unwilling to inform on others and by regulations that bar people with substance abuse convictions from obtaining or that require a drug test to receive public assistance, and by a drug treatment system designed for men.", "Getting access to the drug counseling that is required in this law is incredibly complicated.", "Also, getting access to the appropriate drug test through the public defender system or through the criminal courts is incredibly complicated.", "Often, the defendant would have to pay for that, which can be prohibitively expensive, depending upon the jurisdiction.", "Black women are almost as likely, and Latinas are 20 percent more likely, to be incarcerated than white women.", "Native American women are incarcerated at six times the rate of their white counterparts, so this is incredibly discriminatory.", "People who have an upper middle class background have the opportunity to work with the criminal justice system to get a different plea arrangement or to get a different conviction that people of color or people who are living below the poverty line just do not have.", "There is absolutely no parity among the convictions across the 50 states and in different jurisdictions that handle this conviction, so that is a big motivator for us on why we want to rethink this.", "Chair Nguyen: Are there questions?", "Assemblyman Matthews: Concerning the amendment you discussed, if I understand you correctly, there would be nothing in place, no requirements in place, for an individual to demonstrate that they have ceased use, possession, or distribution in order to gain access to these programs.", "No requirements whatsoever.", "Is that correct?", "Shane Piccinini: There would be no requirements for them to get access to these benefits, correct.", "Assemblyman Matthews: Hypothetically, there could be someone who had been convicted and conceivably could still in an ongoing way not only be perhaps using himself or herself, but actively distributing to others, perhaps even to minors, and would still not be barred from participation and access to these programs.", "Am I correct about that as well?", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 24, 2021 Shane Piccinini: That is correct, but what you are describing are matters that need to be addressed by the criminal justice system and not by the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).", "Assemblyman Matthews: Has any analysis been done on the extent to which this would increase eligibility for the program in terms of numbers?", "Do we have any data on how many people are currently unable to access these programs because of the requirements who would now access them under this bill?", "What might the fiscal impact of that be to the State?", "Shane Piccinini: There are two answers to your question.", "There is no impact to the State.", "There are roughly 400,000 people currently enrolled into the SNAP program, but I cannot tell you the number of people enrolled in TANF; however, it is a fairly low number.", "Less than 4,000 people between July 2019 through January of this year were denied because of their substance abuse convictions.", "The harder number to get at is the number of people who may have been eligible through all the other qualifications that are in SNAP and TANF who did not apply because they knew that they would be denied because of the ban.", "There is just no way to know that.", "Assemblywoman Titus: I want to thank you, Shane, and the Food Bank of Northern Nevada for all you are doing in this day of the pandemic and with food insecurity, and throughout the schools.", "I have seen the excellent work you and your volunteers do to help with food insecurity.", "This has been a tough time, so, thanks to you and all your workers for what you do.", "In looking at section 1 of the bill, the proposal is to eliminate that a person has actually gone through a treatment program, and I certainly understand the need to eliminate that.", "In all the committees I have been on\u2014mental health, behavioral health, public health\u2014and as a public health officer, there are just not enough programs.", "To demand that someone has completed or entered a program, I absolutely support removing that, because I think that is a barrier.", "When you are asking them to do a program that they cannot possibly do, that is not a parity in any way, so I am good with that.", "I have not seen the amendment, but is there new wording being added under section 1, subsection 2, paragraph (a)?", "Currently, on the copy I have it reads, \"Demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Division that he or she is not currently possessing, using or distributing

it all.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 24, 2021 Assemblywoman Titus: I think I heard that your argument to remove that language was because people could not get in for drug testing and that there is a cost to that.", "That is a true statement, but I do not see that the language on that line requires that you have drug testing.", "I am interpreting this, and maybe we could get our legal counsel to chime in here.", "That line just reads \"Demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Division .", ".", ".\"", "that they are not using.", "That would be up to that office, the TANF folks and others who are involved in this, food distribution, et cetera, that they are not using.", "Nowhere in this bill do I see that it required a drug test.", "Shane Piccinini: The drug testing piece of that, and perhaps I muddied the waters, but that is something other states have used with similar language.", "What we have done with the amendment is to remove the language that suggests that, \"to the satisfaction of the Department,\" to say in the amendment that anybody with a substance abuse conviction could not be denied solely because of that conviction.", "Assemblywoman Titus: That is not how I interpreted this.", "That line would just require in good faith that they show up sober or not impaired.", "It is easy to demonstrate that, perhaps, just by showing up.", "We would be one of five states that do not have any requirements or anything, I use the term \"a carrot,\" to help encourage these folks to continue not using, so there would be no restrictions whatsoever in their application.", "Shane Piccinini: There are currently 25 states that do not have a ban at all, that do not require any of this and have language very similar to what our amendment says.", "Assemblywoman Titus: Which is just eliminating any responsibility at all, correct?", "Shane Piccinini: It eliminates the requirement for a client applying for food stamps to address their prior criminal activity at all, correct.", "Assemblywoman Titus: Keeping in there and if I might follow through on this chain, Madame Chair, because already in the language is that a person could apply if that person were pregnant, regardless of any of the above language.", "Again, because of the expectant mom and unborn child, we want to make sure those folks are taken care of, so there was never a ban on those entities being either drug free or in a program.", "We had that part still in statute, but what this amendment would do is totally eliminate any obligation, any restriction, any accessibility for the person identified as a felon.", "Correct?", "Shane Piccinini: Right.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 24, 2021 Chair Nguyen: We do not have our legal counsel on this call.", "They are busy drafting our bill draft request now, but I believe Ms. Swearingen from DWSS and someone from DHHS are on the line to answer any other questions.", "I do not know if they have any input on Assemblywoman Titus's concerns regarding that interpretation.", "Assemblywoman Titus: I want clarity that there was never a mandatory drug test in that requirement.", "The language did not say you had to have a drug test; it just had to be satisfactorily demonstrated.", "That was all I wanted to clarify.", "Shane Piccinini: Yes, you are correct.", "There was never a mandatory drug test in there.", "Assemblywoman Peters: I am looking at our community today and wondering about folks who had a felony conviction from 1997, have been employed for the last 20-30 years, but were laid off because of the pandemic.", "They have to additionally prove that in 1997 they met the mandatory requirements\u2014which in this are vague, so I imagine they are in regulations\u2014to apply for SNAP benefits today, 20 years after their conviction.", "Is that correct?", "Shane Piccinini: Yes, that is correct, and in Nevada, the requirement, as I recall, was a 30-day treatment program accredited by the State.", "There was a process they would follow to make sure that the rehab program met the standard.", "Assemblywoman Peters: If they were unemployed and applied for SNAP benefits but could not prove they had previously gone through that program in 1997 because the records were lost\u2014possibly in a flood, which happened in 1997\u2014they would have to go through an additional 30-day treatment program 20 years after their conviction to be eligible for SNAP benefits.", "Shane Piccinini: That is correct, but the caveat to that would be that they may not be allowed into an additional program because they are no longer an active user.", "As Assemblywoman Titus pointed out, there are simply not enough programs in Nevada to meet the current need.", "Assemblywoman Peters: In that 20-year time period, say they had three or four children and they were the sole provider for their family.", "Would their children have access to that SNAP benefit until they were able to prove that?", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 24, 2021 Shane Piccinini: The children would still get access to SNAP [Exhibit F].", "Our concern there is that you would have three people trying to use the benefit that was only for two, if it were a single mom with two kids, which is generally the case.", "Assemblywoman Peters: With the original draft of this bill, in that scenario, what would they have to provide to demonstrate that they are not currently \"possessing, using or distributing\"?", "Would they have to open their house up for an inspection?", "Would they have to pee in a cup?", "What kind of process would they have to go through to demonstrate that 20 years after their conviction, after three kids, that they were not using drugs or currently in possession of drugs in order to establish SNAP benefits?", "Shane Piccinini: That is incredibly subjective, which is why the language is being removed from the bill.", "It could change from one director of the Department of Health and Human Services to another if it was done through the regulatory process.", "As you can tell in the bill, it does not describe what that looks like, so we are removing that language.", "Making it as clean as possible was the best option.", "Assemblywoman Thomas: I want to reiterate that the language in section 1, subsection 2, paragraph (a), \"Demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Division,\" will be removed.", "Shane Piccinini: That is correct.", "In the amendment, that language is completely stricken from the bill.",

Martinez, I apologize; this is the first time I have seen the amendment and I am trying to understand the clarification of it.", "In the bill that was presented to us, in addition to those who were using and possessing drugs, there was a requirement for drug dealers to demonstrate that they were no longer selling drugs.", "Is it your intent to remove that requirement and allow drug dealers now to get these benefits?", "Assemblywoman Martinez: This was the category we had, anyone who had a drug offense.", "To help them facilitate, they have already gone through the court system [unintelligible].", "Chair Nguyen: I think we have some sound issues with Assemblywoman Martinez.", "Is there someone else who could reiterate?", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 24, 2021 Shane Piccinini: The reason we also wanted to include the distribution part of that was because somebody could have been a distributor in 1997, and, as Assemblywoman Peters pointed out, had a clean track record for a number of years.", "The person had done their time, was doing what they were supposed to be doing, so there was no reason to continue to hold this over their head.", "Also, what was considered to be a distribution or possession charge in 1996 was substantially different than it is today.", "There is no easy way for us to determine what is or is not an appropriate charge.", "All of this is taken care of through the criminal justice system.", "Again, it makes no sense for the Department of Health and Human Services to be in that part of the work.", "Assemblyman Hafen: For clarification, the section in the bill being stricken by the amendment that says, \"Demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Division .", ".", ".", ",\" you are saying that it is difficult to make those determinations.", "More government oversight, and you are trying to get rid of some of that.", "Am I understanding that correctly?", "Shane Piccinini: What we are trying to do is eliminate a subjective part of the bill.", "It may not be applied evenly in the State of Nevada, administration over administration.", "The cleaner this is, the less administrative burden there is for the Department to try to figure out what that means and to spend the time trying to track down 20-year old certificates.", "Additionally, we want to bring parity to the rest of this class of people to everybody else in the population.", "This class of people is the only one that is denied benefits under the regulations.", "In order for this to really be clean, and to allow the Department to do the work that it needs to do, removing this barrier is just common sense.", "Assemblyman Matthews: Questions from the Committee covered the extreme ends of the possibilities here.", "We talked about how this would allow those who are currently engaging in new use, distribution, or possession to access the program.", "Assemblywoman Peters brought up the other end of the spectrum that this would bar participation by those who perhaps had their conviction 20 years ago and perhaps lost the records showing they had gone through treatment.", "In crafting this bill, was any thought given to addressing that time frame?", "This is going to become an arbitrary suggestion; I am not saying this is the magic number but, for the sake of argument, a conviction more than five or six years into the past, perhaps the requirements in the pre-amended version might be waived.", "If the conviction were more recent, then some requirements might make sense.", "Was any thought given to that, and, if so, why was that approach rejected?", "Shane Piccinini: Yes, some thought has been given to that, and the research would also tell you that the people who are actively going through recovery are some of the most vulnerable populations there are.", "Ensuring that they have access to healthy food ensures a much greater success and completion in their recovery than if that were not available to them.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 24, 2021 Assemblyman Matthews: Assemblywoman Peters introduced a hypothetical scenario, but the bill was crafted in a way not necessarily to target those but really with an eye toward those who were more recently convicted as opposed to those convicted in the past.", "That was the focus of the bill\u2014to really address not so much those whose convictions may have been decades in the past, but those for whom the conviction may have been more recent.", "Would that be fair?", "Shane Piccinini: Not necessarily.", "What we want to do is make it so the conviction, regardless of when it happened, was not relevant at all.", "Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: If a person is convicted of driving under the influence (DUI), or convicted of trafficking or convicted of murder, are they barred once they have served their time\u2014whether they did the short end or the long end of conviction?", "No matter how long ago they got out, are they barred from participating in any of these programs?", "I think what I am hearing is that this is strictly about drugs and nothing else.", "Am I wrong?", "Shane Piccinini: You are exactly right.", "This only has to do with substance abuse.", "A murder, white collar crime, DUI, there are no other classifications in the criminal code that would bar somebody from these programs.", "Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: Those other convictions have no requirements for them to do any type of prove up which was part of this law.", "Prove up that they are not trafficking, that they are not drinking if they had a DUI, or not participating in other criminal activities.", "They are not required to prove up anything in order to get benefits, only those people who have drug convictions.", "Is that correct?", "Shane Piccinini: That is correct.", "Any requirements that the court may impose on those individuals would not prevent them from having access to SNAP or TANF.", "Assemblywoman Black: The language in this bill mentions being enrolled in or have completed a drug treatment program, and then verify or somehow prove that you are not using an illegal substance.", "I thought we said earlier that there was no required drug testing, but how do people verify that they are not on drugs?", "Shane Piccinini: I do not have any idea how that would work.", "The Department would have to write regulations and figure that out.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services February 24, 2021 Assemblywoman Black: That is what it says right now.", "Shane Piccinini: That language is being removed with our amendment.", "Assemblywoman Black: The bill as it was originally written says that you are required to either enroll in or have completed a drug treatment program and you are required to prove you are not using a controlled substance.", "Is that wrong?", "Shane Piccinini: That is how the original bill was written, and that is why we offered the amendment.", "It did not offer what we were trying to do, which was eliminate the need for the certificate at all.", "Actually, that is not true.", "What we were trying to do was make it so the conviction was not relevant at all toward being approved for benefits.", "Assemblywoman Black: I am not worried about the conviction part of this.", "Say someone comes in, they are actively in a treatment program, or they have a certificate that says they completed one.", "Then, they are required to prove that they are not on a controlled substance.", "How do they prove that?", "Shane Piccinini: In some states other than Nevada, that led to drug testing.", "Nevada has never had that, and it is our position that Nevada should never adopt that as a policy.", "Chair Nguyen: I believe Ms. Swearingen can answer your questions better.", "Can you respond to what the existing law is?", "Lisa Swearingen, Chief, Eligibility and Payments, Division of Welfare and Supportive Services,

information regarding individuals.", "That is done on the Medicaid side.", "That is a concern for us\u2014how we would even monitor or implement that type of program.", "Assemblywoman Black: Maybe it

people every year are getting on opioids or other substances.", "What about those people?", "I feel as though that was the intent of this bill, not to penalize people from 30 years ago, but to help incentivize people who are getting on opioids today or selling drugs today.", "I understand that if we push them too hard and make it too hard to get support, that that almost pushes them farther down that rabbit hole, but we need some sort of middle ground.", "Basically, you are taking every single thing off the table here and just saying, do drugs, sell drugs, whatever you want, not our problem, here is your assistance.", "As someone with an opioid user in my life, that is a problem for me.", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: I appreciate what Assemblywoman Titus, Assemblywoman Black, and Assemblyman Matthews put on the record, but I think that in this bigger conversation we are having about how opioids affect our communities and about how we jail and sentence people, we are always

enough to deter recidivism.", "Jennifer E. Copp explored it in her research and stated that the deterrence effect of a prison-only system does not account for the socioeconomic realities that people face on release.", "Put another way, prison alone cannot reduce recidivism rates, and to be effective, there must be strong socioeconomic support for individuals who are released.", "While some may argue that an individual's behavior or characteristic dictates recidivism, the Prison Policy Institute has noted that the strongest predictor for recidivism is poverty\u2014a lack of access to resources.", "According to the Nevada

systems to implement \"Zero Suicide.\"", "The Zero Suicide initiative is grounded in the idea that suicide can be prevented and that detecting, assessing, and treating suicidality is effective.", "All

of developing these regulations involved input from stakeholders and includes public workshops and hearings to ensure ample opportunity where input is considered.", "Assemblywoman Peters: I will now go to the second part of this bill which gets at another issue we see: mental health coverage.", "This is related to insurance coverage.", "Some of the most overwhelming conversations I have had with people are not about their heart medication, access to vaccines, or ability to schedule surgery; it is about access to mental and behavioral health services that patients need today.", "The federal government requires compliance with the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008.", "This act is currently mentioned in our statutes; however, there is a lack of clarity in the health and insurance industry as to what parity methods are\u2014what makes up parity.", "Consistently I hear from constituents and patients that their coverage misses the mark.", "We are not proposing a prescription to remedy this parity ambiguity today.", "We are, however, requesting that the Division of Insurance, Department of Business and Industry, have the authority to proactively review parity metrics from insurance providers in the state, including PEBP [Public Employees' Benefits Program] and Medicaid, to determine what the baseline of parity is in Nevada.", "I have heard from the insurance industry that parity reporting is required by the federal government; however, the federal government is not the folks on the ground hearing the complaints from constituents and trying to assess and determine parity violations.", "That burden already falls to the state and even then, it is not proactive.", "The state process for addressing parity starts on the backs of our vulnerable populations who have felt that their right to parities of service have been violated.", "These individuals have to submit a complaint with supporting evidence to the Consumer Services Section of the Division of Insurance for review of their cases.", "This is usually done when the patients learn that the services they are looking for are not being covered and not accessible for their immediate needs.", "This bill requests that this activity be completed proactively rather than on the backs of the patients already in need of support.", "An amendment to this bill will request that the Patient Protection Commission within in the Office of the Governor takes these two data streams and use them to assess and determine Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 8, 2021 adequacy of coverage from both the services and insurance sides for patients in Nevada.", "Although this bill requests data directly from the industry, this is a patient-centric bill, focusing on the two sides of the sword representing the burden of mental health care in our state.", "I want to be clear that we are looking at an amendment for the second section [Exhibit D],

Division of Insurance to create a less prescriptive statute around this issue and also to include the Patient Protection Commission directive to get this data from these two data streams.", "I am not going to go through the sections of this bill, but there has been recent federal legislation related to the reporting requirements of insurance companies, and I have been working with the Division of Insurance to ensure that the language in this bill allows the Division of Insurance to incorporate those federal requirements while also meeting the desired parity outcomes proposed through adoption of this bill.", "The amendment will modify sections 7 through 9 to remove that prescriptive language.", "At this time, I will pass the discussion on to Lea Case who will talk more about mental health

Association and Nevada Psychiatric Association submitted a letter to Nevada Medicaid on August 8, 2019.", "We want to applaud Nevada Medicaid's quick action in opening an investigation and resolving the parity issue with the insurer on January 6, 2020.", "This demonstrates a need for a proactive approach to parity compliance; if this psychiatrist had not taken personal time to investigate their patient's insurance policy to determine why they were being denied care, this complaint would not have been submitted and the insurer would continue to be noncompliant.", "Parity compliance should be

incredibly important issue we need to deal with, and we have seen even more of it during this pandemic.", "You speak about timely data collection, and that is one of my concerns about this bill.", "When we have a potential suicide come through our emergency room (ER), et cetera, we do not make that determination right away.", "There could be toxicology issues, or sometimes it is a coroner's case because if they die within so many hours of coming into the ER, it becomes a coroner's case.", "So there is a delay in getting some information.", "What is a reasonable expectation about \"timely notification\"?", "Stephanie Woodard: It is a great question and something we would like to discuss during the regulatory development process.", "Currently, the billing and claims data that we have would, potentially, provide this information to us, but because of the lag, we are getting that data 90 to 120 days out.", "Certainly, anything sooner than that would be major progress.", "We also recognize that there is a need for syndromic surveillance data.", "Recently, we have been able to pull syndromic surveillance data related to suicide attempts and ideation from our emergency rooms.", "It is an incomplete data set because we are only getting about 80 percent of the reporting through syndromic surveillance, but we intend to use the syndromic surveillance really for that timely reporting so that we can have a finger on the pulse of what is happening statewide.", "When we use syndromic surveillance, we know we are sacrificing accuracy for timeliness because of the way that data is pulled from the EHRs [electronic health records].", "We are really looking for this other dataset to be able to balance against the syndromic surveillance dataset, so we recognize that we may be sacrificing some of that timeliness but we will then be able to get the accuracy.", "Assemblywoman Titus: Do all hospitals have access to that surveillance set and data information?", "One of the problems I see here is the amount of reporting hospitals are required to do.", "You are not asking the provider to do this; you are asking the medical facility to do this.", "Who are the other folks who have to report this kind of data?", "Providers are already mandatory reporters for different levels of things, and this is another level of reporting that hospitals would have to do.", "The hospitals already have to do extensive reporting.", "Will they be using the same computer system?", "You mentioned electronic medical records (EMRs), and we know that many EMRs do not communicate with each other, so what is that going to look like?", "Once you have determined the time frame, will there be a fine if they do not follow through?", "I think the information is critical, but I am still worried about the process.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 8, 2021 Stephanie Woodard: For overdose reporting, hospitals currently have three different pathways.", "The first is probably the easiest because it allows for a data extraction to occur directly from the electronic health record.", "This data extraction is then placed in a file which is sent to the Division of Public and Behavioral Health.", "Another way is through a fax.", "We recognize that not all electronic health records have the capabilities nor maybe the sophistication to be able to develop and extract the data file, so the fax is an option several hospitals continue to use for overdose reporting.", "We have also worked with Bitfocus's Clarity, a vendor used by other hospitals to report into the Homeless Management Information System.", "We worked with them to develop a data platform for overdose reporting, and we are working with them currently to augment that report so hospitals using that for overdose reporting would be able to use it to satisfy the requirements of this bill.", "Assemblywoman Titus: I have looked at the bill and the proposed amendment involving sections 7 through 9 to remove the prescriptive language related to data collection.", "I have a question regarding that process of reporting.", "Conceptually, I think it is a good idea.", "As a provider, when I see a patient and I determine that the patient needs x, y, or z, it is very frustrating when we try to get prior authorization and the insurer says it is not covered or no, instead you have to do a, b, and c first.", "I think I understand what you are trying to achieve here, but I am wondering whether there are other mandatory descriptions in statute for when insurance companies deny a service?", "Is that listed anywhere, or would this be a unique thing to mental health parity?", "Are we asking the insurance companies to do something they already do and then add that to the list of reporting when they deny something, or are we looking at having them report if they have denied a mental health service?", "Do they have to disclose if that was not part of their original insurance contract?", "I am trying to clarify what they would have to report.", "Assemblywoman Peters: The language in the original bill was much more prescriptive than intended.", "At this time, the intention is to get a general baseline for what those parity metrics are in existing insurance coverage.", "One difficulty is that the interpretation of parity is inconsistent.", "In Nevada, we want to see what parity metrics are being met by these individual insurance companies in order to see the picture that patients are in.", "As you said, are they being denied service because of insurance coverage and whether that is equitable or not or inconsistent with industry parity.", "The revisions to this section would allow the Division of Insurance to promulgate regulations requiring that data collection piece, but not necessarily create the enforcement mechanisms you are describing that would be a blessing to this industry.", "That is one of the biggest complaints I hear: \"I need the service but I cannot get it.", "My insurance will not cover it.", "It is too expensive on my own, or my child has special needs and I need them to be in this facility rather than in this other facility, but I cannot get there because I am forced to go here.\"", "Those kinds of issues will come at a later time once we have a better idea what those parity metrics will look like.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 8, 2021 Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: My question concerns the amendment and legislative intent.", "This would change from Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 449 to NRS Chapter 441A.", "As I read this, the intent is reporting on suicide attempts and suicide completions specific to opioids because that chapter is concerned with infectious disease and reporting on opioids.", "I imagine you are not just looking for that, but having it in the communicable disease chapter feels as though it is being narrowed.", "I imagine you would still want to know about a person presenting in the ER with a single gunshot wound to the head and those kinds of suicides.", "For the record, spell out why NRS Chapter 441A is the best place to house this language.", "Stephanie Woodard: Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 441A includes all communicable diseases to be reported as well as overdoses from Assembly Bill 474 of the 79th Session.", "This would also allow us to collect and analyze that data as it relates to suicide.", "When it comes to behavioral health, we do not have the statutory authority to establish these kinds of reporting regulations, so we have to look to established authority within the public health side.", "Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 441A has been the area of existing statute that seems to fit best when we are looking at collecting population health data like this.", "Kyra Morgan, Chief Biostatistician, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services: Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 441A is also where we have all our real-time reportable conditions that require individual follow-up.", "By placing the overdose regulations there, the idea was that those were cases that potentially would require that really quick follow-up by a disease investigator.", "We wanted to mirror the regulation for suicide reporting to be similar to overdose reporting so that if we wanted to have that real-time communication with disease investigation, it would fall in line with how we do that for communicable diseases.", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: Right now, you are able to extrapolate the data, but you have to do it in an indirect way, so the goal is to make sure you are getting the data much more quickly.", "Could you talk about the difference between the status quo and the information you get\u2014which is taking six months to a year\u2014versus your goal for this legislation which would be to get it in days, weeks, or months?", "Would you clarify that?", "Stephanie Woodard: We currently have billing and claims data, so there is a dataset that pulls all the emergency room and hospital billing claims.", "That dataset typically has a 90- to 120-day lag.", "As Kyra Morgan mentioned, this allows us to do some of that follow-up.", "We hope we will be able to get this data in a much more timely way than looking at three to four months out.", "Exactly what that time period is would need to be determined during the regulatory development process.", "That is where we will be engaging with stakeholders to figure out what a reasonable time frame would be for us to expect to get this data.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 8, 2021 Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: For the record, right now, you are looking for when a provider has a known interaction with a person and knows that person attempted or completed suicide.", "You mean this to be different from what CMS [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services] and The Joint Commission have right now around sentinel events and those kinds of suicides, right?", "Stephanie Woodard: Yes, we are not seeking to find information related to sentinel events.", "We are looking to identify individuals who are presenting for care in an emergency room related to a suicide attempt.", "Chair Nguyen: There was an amendment by Mr. Tom Clark that is considered unfriendly at this time.", "Do you have an update on that?", "Assemblywoman Peters: I had an opportunity to talk to Mr. Clark and let him know that we were working with the Division of Insurance on an amendment to address their concerns.", "We will continue to work with them as stakeholders on that process to ensure that we are preparing something that is beneficial to Nevada.", "Hopefully, we can get to a neutral place with them.", "Chair Nguyen: It looks as though all the conceptual amendments Assemblywoman Peters referenced are now uploaded to NELIS under \"Exhibits.\"", "Are there further questions?", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: I think it is important to talk about section 7 and going forward into the bill, but it makes the most sense to see what those amendments will look like and how the bill will read.", "Assemblywoman Peters: Yes, we are essentially gutting those sections, so asking questions about the language as it is written today would not be helpful.", "I have the Division of Insurance's proposed amendment language.", "It just showed in my email box, so I will have a chance to review it.", "I will send it around to the Committee when it is ready.", "I apologize for the delay, but we want to make sure that we are getting it right, especially in light of recent federal legislation.", "We want to make sure we are not duplicating any efforts.", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: I appreciate that and look forward to seeing what the conversation will be.", "Chair Nguyen: Are there further questions?", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 8, 2021 Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: There has been discussion about various modes to share this data.", "Has there been any discussion about a singular software or singular data entry area where the data can be input, everyone can use it, and then it could be more easily extrapolated?", "Is that part of this discussion?", "Is there a possibility for there to be a private industry software or portal that could be shared across the different providers that would help facilitate this more quickly?", "Assemblywoman Peters: This bill does not address that issue.", "However, I know the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has been working with stakeholders, including the hospitals, on how to make that line of data be as streamlined as possible so we are not creating an overburden on one side or the other.", "One of the advantages to creating a kind of raw database is that you can assimilate that data in a variety of ways.", "I believe that is being discussed in other areas and was presented through the Patient Protection Commission or the Interim Legislative Committee on Health Care; however, that is not a piece of what we are talking about today.", "Stephanie Woodard: There are three different ways hospitals can currently report, and we do not have a preference either way.", "We want to make it as least burdensome as possible.", "For those organizations that would prefer to use a manual-input database, we do have an overdose reporting database that is being reengineered to be able to collect all the data related to A.B.", "181.", "Providers can also fax a report or they can do a data extract.", "The data extract seems to be the least burdensome because it will allow that data to be pulled directly from their electronic health record and then be batched in a data file that can then be analyzed by DHHS.", "We are open to other solutions, but as you mentioned, most other solutions would require some additional funding in order for us to be able to create a singular data repository.", "Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: I assume whether someone is reporting with a faxed document, or using the data extract, or the third option, data input, the questions, the answers, the data, is all consistent no matter what.", "When that data goes in, it is the same at the end, and you can then extrapolate that data to get the most accurate answers.", "Am I correct?", "Stephanie Woodard: Yes, regardless of the way the data is provided to DHHS, that data is reviewed and cleaned and then put into a file where the data can then be analyzed.", "Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: I appreciate the information.", "All of us are really concerned about mental health right now.", "I am seeing more discussions about mental health crises, whether they are connected with substance abuse or just in general in the African-American community, than I have ever seen before.", "In primetime television, we are seeing examples of folks seeking help, and they are making it normal and okay for folks in our community.", "There has been such a stigma about mental health issues.", "Anything we can do to help people find a way to get help is really important.", "I do not know how you speed up the process; I am sure you are working on that, Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 8, 2021 and I hope this legislation will help you do that.", "I am looking forward to reading all the amendments, and I appreciate you, Assemblywoman Peters, for bringing this forward.", "Assemblywoman Peters: Thank you.", "This is a really important issue, and something that touches all of us, whether directly or through friends and family who have looked for services or who have been in the web of mental health care in Nevada.", "The Department of Health and Human Services has been putting a huge amount of work into the idea of destigmatizing mental health services and those needs.", "It is a work in progress because it is not just patient-based; that stigma even includes the providers\u2014even identifying and acknowledging that someone may or may not need those services has created stigmas in reporting.", "Trying to break down those barriers is a piece of this puzzle.", "The more we talk about it openly, the more we see it actively, and the more we hold folks accountable who may be the bottlenecks in this area, the better off our communities will be.", "Chair Nguyen:

parity, especially as it pertains to the kids who are really struggling in our state.", "A recent report from the Milliman Institute shows that a child's mental health office visit is 10.1 or 1,000 percent times more likely to be out-of-network than a primary care office visit, which is twice as much as a mental health office visit for an adult.", "Furthermore, children's utilization of inpatient and outpatient facilities are 500 percent more likely to face out-of-network charges for behavioral health care than medical or surgical care.", "Additionally, spending for mental health care has not shifted and makes up only 2.4 percent of the overall health care expense.", "This is why it is so crucial that we have parity so children have equal access to mental health care as they do for physical health care access.", "Our state currently ranks fifty-first in the nation for children's mental health services, according to Mental Health America (MHA).", "The fact that we lack parity through many of our insurers in this state is a crucial reason for which kids are not able to access timely care that they need which is critical at this time of the COVID-19 crisis\u2014where we have seen our suicide rates in children as young as eight spiking in our cities and where we see high school failure and dropout at a higher rate than ever.", "We are in an enormous crisis and by

court, and all those other systems.", "Is that correct?", "Assemblywoman Miller: As stated in the video we saw and what we previously addressed\u2014the goal of the program is to not require the child or youth to have to repeat their story multiple times.", "This was brought up by a public defender's office.", "In a case, both sides may need to have access to materials.", "Within the law, with a court order, they could have access to it.", "We want confidentiality to stay in there to protect the victim, but if what is revealed needs to become part of a court case, it would have to be available.", "Chair Nguyen: Is there any follow-up?", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: I was not thinking so much about the inclusion of subsection 6 out of NRS Chapter 239B.", "The way I was interpreting this, it seemed like there was some maintenance of information Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 17, 2021 by the Affordable Care Act (of 2010) as opposed to

identified 1,050 school-aged, unaccompanied homeless youth.", "The problem is as prevalent in our rural areas as it is in our urban communities, touching every corner of our state.", "Assembly Bill 197 seeks to eliminate barriers that can prevent unaccompanied homeless youth from accessing the critical health care services and documents they need to exit homelessness.", "I would now like to turn it over to Mr. Ghafoori and Mr. Jenkins to explain why this issue is so important, then I will walk you through the bill and will stand for any questions members of the Committee may have.", "Arash Ghafoori, Executive Director, Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth: As Assemblyman Watts mentioned, youth homelessness is a very serious and significant problem in Nevada.", "While every young person's story is unique, youth often experience homelessness on their own because of family instability, structural issues, and economic instability [Exhibit O].", "Youth homelessness disproportionately affects some communities of youth more than others: systems-involved youth, pregnant and parenting youth, LGBTQ+ youth, and youth of color are more likely to experience homelessness than their peers.", "Additionally, young people experiencing homelessness are more likely to experience domestic violence and/or human trafficking.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 17, 2021 Due to the difficulties and complications of living on the streets or in shelters, histories of trauma, and limited access to resources, homeless young people experience higher rates of illness and injury, including malnutrition, dental disease, respiratory and infectious diseases, sexually transmitted infections, pregnancy, substance abuse, and increased future risk of diabetes and heart disease.", "Additionally, homeless youth experience significantly higher rates of mental illness.", "Homeless teenagers are 7.2 times more likely to attempt suicide than housed teenagers.", "Consequently, increasing access to health care for minors experiencing homelessness is paramount to the health of vulnerable young people and the wellness of our entire state.", "In my ten years at Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth, southern Nevada's most comprehensive service provider for young people experiencing homelessness, I have seen countless young people present with health issues ranging from mild to severe.", "In order to ensure that young people can access the care they need, Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth has partnered with many fantastic health care organizations, including Nevada Health Centers; the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) School of Nursing; the UNLV Dental Clinic, Southern Nevada Adult Mental Health Services, the Lions Clubs International Lions Kid Sight USA Foundation, and others.", "However, many of our health care partners have faced barriers in providing services to unaccompanied homeless minors due to limiting and unclear language in Nevada law.", "Current law only allows medical providers to serve unaccompanied youth once they have been homeless for four months or more and does not clearly explain how providers can determine which youth qualify.", "Accordingly, Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth has worked with many health care providers who truly want to serve youth in need but feel unsure about how to implement the current law correctly.", "Assembly Bill 197 addresses this by establishing a simple and proven process to verify that a minor is covered by this law.", "The verification process proposed in this bill is modeled on the federal financial aid process which Nevada public schools, universities, and service providers have been utilizing since 2008.", "This same process is also used in a similar health care access law for minors in Maine and in a California law helping minors access vital documents.", "Assembly Bill 197 also allows unaccompanied homeless minors to access care right away when it is needed.", "This timing is extremely important, as a lack of immediate care can lead to routine problems becoming dangerous and can even lead to death by suicide, overdose, or untreated illness in a population already prone to heightened health risks.", "Current law allows unaccompanied minors to access treatment from a physician or hospital.", "However, many providers who are available to provide care to our young people are nurses and nurse practitioners, physician assistants, dental hygienists, and other licensed professionals who are not clearly covered under the existing law.", "Furthermore, many young people we serve have urgent and important health care needs that are not appropriately met by physicians or hospitals, but rather by behavioral health, mental health, and dental health professionals.", "Assembly Bill 197 takes care of this, clarifying that unaccompanied minors Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 17, 2021 can access not only health care services provided by a physician or hospital, but also mental and behavioral health, dental, and other critical services provided by all \"providers of health care,\" a category already defined

unaccompanied youth to access basic health and behavioral health services without a parent.", "The American Academy of Pediatrics also supports these measures.", "This bill will simply clarify and fortify Nevada\u2019s existing law, ensuring that unaccompanied youth have access to basic health services they need to stay safe, healthy, and able to succeed in work and school, empowering them to transition out of homelessness.", "By providing minors access to physical, mental, and behavioral health care now, we can prevent more long-term, chronic health issues from occurring, saving Nevada

introduced to Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth through their Feel Good Friday outreach event when I was 12 years old.", "There I got food and other supplies every week.", "Eventually, I came to their Drop-In Center for homeless youth where I got help getting my ID, food, clothes, school supplies, hygiene supplies, and much more.", "By the time I was 17 years old, I reached the breaking point with my homeless situation and there came a time when I had no other place to go but Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth.", "I was able to move into their transitional housing program, where I got to eat; I got guidance; I learned life skills; I got therapy; and I finally got to sleep regularly.", "In addition to experiencing homelessness off and on since I was 12 years old, I have suffered from asthma my whole life.", "Accordingly, my ability to access health care has often been a life-or-death situation for me.", "I know I am not alone in this.", "According to the Institute for Children, Poverty, and Homelessness, high school students who were homeless in the past Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 17, 2021 30 days had the highest rate of uncontrolled asthma\u2014over two times higher than that of their housed peers.", "Due to not always having the ability to obtain my mom\u2019s consent, there have been times when I have not been able to see a doctor or get my inhaler, which is a scary and dangerous situation.", "When I was in Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth's housing program, I was hospitalized with a life-threatening asthma attack, but luckily I was already over the age of 18 and able to consent to all the health services I needed to recover.", "I was in Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth's housing program for three years and am still very active in youth engagement and leadership development activities with Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth.", "Accordingly, I have gotten to know a lot of young people experiencing homelessness over the years.", "Just recently there have been youth who have not been able to seek medical care for chest pains, who could not seek physical therapy after a gunshot wound limited their mobility, and who could not get treatment for a serious mental health crisis due to being unable to obtain parental consent as unaccompanied minors.", "I have also known of youth who could not access important preventive and other health care services offered by Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth's partners, including dental cleanings, physical health checkups and screenings, and vision tests, because they could not consent to these services themselves as unaccompanied minors.", "This is especially important right now with COVID-19, as homeless minors have been turned away from COVID-19 testing because they have been unable to obtain guardian consent, putting not only themselves but also youth, staff, and others at risk.", "Assembly Bill 197 would make a huge difference for youth like me, allowing unaccompanied homeless minors to access the physical, mental, and behavioral health care they need.", "I graduated from Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth's housing program, and now I have a job and my own place.", "I can tell you it is difficult enough to try to navigate homelessness as a youth and to do everything you need to do to succeed in school, get a job, and eventually move into permanent housing, but having to do all of that with untreated health issues makes it almost impossible.", "By passing this bill, you can make sure that unaccompanied minors can get the health care they need to survive, thrive, and build a better future for themselves and their communities.", "Thank you for your time.", "Chair Nguyen: Thank you, Mr. Jenkins, you did a wonderful job in your first time testifying or presenting here.", "We appreciate your sharing your story.", "I know it is very personal, and it is not always easy to relive that.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 17, 2021 Assemblyman Watts: We do not have anyone else presenting, but I will walk you through the bill, then be open to questions.", "Section 1, subsection 1 removes the requirement that a young person be homeless for four months before he or she can access health care without consent of a parent or guardian, allowing unaccompanied homeless minors to access care as soon as needs are identified.", "Subsection 2 assists health care providers in determining when this statute applies by establishing a clear and simple process to verify when a minor is an unaccompanied homeless youth.", "This process is tried-and-true from our federal financial aid procedures and other processes and allows options such as written statements from service providers, school homeless liaisons under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, or attorneys representing the youth.", "Section 1, subsection 3 clarifies that unaccompanied minors can access not only physical health care services provided by a physician or hospital, but also mental and behavioral health, dental, and other critical services currently defined in statute under the inclusive term \"provider of health care.\"", "This will ensure that homeless youth can receive the health care services that meet their varied needs, including preventive care.", "Subsection 4 makes conforming language changes and clarifies that while a provider must ask for the minor's consent to communicate with parents or guardians, the provider cannot delay or deny care to the young person if the young person refuses that consent.", "Section 2, subsection 5, paragraph (a) improves on Assembly Bill 363 of the 80th Session by clarifying that people experiencing homelessness can get a fee waiver for

terminology from \"physician\" to cover other practitioners, you could make those decisions.", "We would be open to entertaining that.", "It was not a deliberate omission; we simply left the rest of the statute alone if it did not deal specifically with access to health care for homeless youth.", "Assemblywoman Titus: I would hate to miss an opportunity to update the statute to what we see as

and clients of Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth, I have encountered many homeless youth who could not access essential care when they needed it, due to restrictions in the law or health care providers' understanding of that law.", "No unaccompanied homeless minor should have to delay important care or screening for things like a tooth abscess, a suspected or confirmed sexually transmitted infection, COVID-19 testing, or a mental health issue.", "Removing the barriers to getting adequate care through strengthening existing law, removing the four-month wait, clarifying that youth can access all health care providers, and helping health care providers implement the law correctly is an essential step in the right direction for the state of Nevada.", "I have seen too many health care providers refuse care to unaccompanied homeless youth for fear they would be violating the law.", "Assembly Bill 197 makes the verification process simpler and aligns with other similar processes such as applying for federal financial aid.", "As a nurse practitioner who works with vulnerable communities, I regularly see the results of patients having poor access to quality health care throughout

2019-2020 Interim.", "It is the result of a study required by Assembly Bill 131 of the 2019 Session.", "The bill required the committee to examine issues related to training for nonmedical caregivers who provide care at certain facilities, compare training standards, and determine whether certain unlicensed employees and contractors should be required to complete a minimum amount of training.",

sterilization procedures, sanitation, infection control, and appropriate care and treatment.", "The A.B.", "131 of the 2019 Session study was also influenced by Nevada's experience during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "According to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), the top three causes of COVID-19 outbreaks in skilled nursing facilities in Nevada were: (1) inappropriate use of personal protective equipment; (2) breaches in isolation of infections of COVID-19; and (3) hand hygiene and hand washing.", "Both the 2017-2018 study and the COVID-19 pandemic emphasized the need for additional Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 15, 2021 and reinforced training on standard infection prevention and control and the proper use of personal protective equipment, among other issues.", "Based on this and other supporting information, the committee's final recommendation was developed with input from officials from the Division of Public and Behavioral Health (DPBH) which is responsible for regulating these facilities.", "We ultimately decided that the best way to ensure unlicensed caregivers receive appropriate training is to have the State Board of Health adopt regulations prescribing these requirements.", "This will allow training requirements to be more flexible and nimble than if they were established in legislation.", "It will also allow the State Board of Health to revise requirements as new issues emerge.", "Assembly Bill 217 requires the State Board of Health to adopt regulations prescribing mandatory training for unlicensed caregivers who provide care at certain medical facilities, facilities for the dependent, and facilities licensed under Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 449.030.", "This essentially includes facilities, homes, agencies, and providers licensed under NRS Chapter 449.", "It does not include care provided in individuals' homes or in other places that are not licensed by DPBH.", "The regulations must designate the type of facilities to which training requirements apply and establish the required topics of training which must include at a minimum control of infectious diseases.", "The State Board of Health must also review the required topics of training at least annually and revise them as necessary to address new issues that affect the health and safety of individuals at the designated facilities.",

requirements developed by the State Board of Health.", "Section 1, subsection 3, requires the person in charge of a facility to which the training regulations apply to ensure that each unlicensed caregiver at the facility completes the required training and documents the completion in the person's personnel file, ensure the best practices taught in the training are implemented at the facility, develop a plan for the control of infectious diseases at the facility and update it annually, and provide a written copy of the plan to every resident, employee, independent contractor, or other person who regularly provides services at the facility.", "Sections 2 through 18 of the bill make conforming changes, and section 19 provides that, while the bill is effective upon passage and approval for the purposes of adopting regulations and performing other administrative tasks, the requirements with which the facilities must comply are not effective until January 1, 2022.", "With us

licensed pursuant to NRS 449.030 that are available for free or at minimal cost from a nationally recognized organization that provides evidence-based training.", "While reviewing statements of deficiency during the pandemic, we saw ancillary staff such as kitchen staff and those cleaning who did not appear to understand the importance of wearing a mask or keeping contaminated cleaning cloths separated from clean ones.", "Although there are required trainings in statutes and regulations for unlicensed caregivers depending on the types of services they are providing, the COVID-19 pandemic revealed a lack of knowledge in infection control and prevention by unlicensed caregivers.", "Therefore, infection control and prevention training would be the focus in the development of the initial regulations.", "That is what the bill is trying to accomplish.", "The topics will be reviewed annually and revised as necessary to address new issues that impact the health and safety at designated facilities.", "Requiring evidence-based training will help ensure that the information provided in the trainings will be effective.", "For example, evidence-based infection control and prevention measures have been shown to prevent and control the spread of the disease.", "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed some really good ones during the pandemic.", "In addition, the bill proposes to carry this out in an efficient and cost-effective manner by utilizing trainings that are free of charge or have very minimal cost for nationally recognized organizations.", "One of the concerns expressed by the industry when requiring trainings is the associated cost.", "So, we will work to alleviate that concern, and we believe the way the bill is written does that.", "In addition, utilizing trainings from nationally recognized organizations that provide evidence-based practices such as the CDC allows individuals to access training online, making it much more easily accessible.", "Chair Nguyen: Are there any additional presenters?", "Assemblywoman Cohen: No, we are ready for questions.", "Assemblywoman Titus: Thank you for the bill.",

doing this.", "Under section 3, subsection 4, those penalties are already in existence, so this is not a new penalty or fee.", "These are already penalties for not following through on workplace

separating clean and dirty articles\u2014for instance, when someone is cleaning a bathroom or public facility.", "How is this different from OSHA training and why is it different?", "Margot Chappel: They would take the same training if it was from the same source.", "However, OSHA does not necessarily go into our facilities.", "We regulate them 100 percent; however, if we have a specific issue related to something OSHA manages or oversees, we send them a complaint.", "As the regulating agency, we are responsible for all of that in those health care facilities.", "Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: You mentioned free or very inexpensive training is available.", "My concern is whether the cost of any of this training would be on the employees or contractors.", "I include contractors because some facilities may employ small independent contractors or even individuals.", "How do you control that?", "My second question is why is this not expanded to include those who go into people's homes as home health care workers, and my question about cost being the responsibility of the employee would also be the same.", "How do you control and ensure that these employees who generally are not making that much money do not have to absorb the cost?", "Margot Chappel: There are separate regulations that govern training requirements for personal care agency staff and home health care staff.", "We have cited a couple of personal care agencies for not providing the training at no cost to their staff.", "That is already addressed in regulation.", "When we develop regulations, we can add something like that.", "Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: The first part of my question regarded those who might be subcontractors at these care facilities.", "Is there any way to make sure they are not having to absorb that cost?", "Margot Chappel: We can add that into the regulations when we start drafting them.", "Chair Nguyen: It is my understanding reading this that the facilities that would be subject to this are licensed by the state division.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 15, 2021 Margot Chappel: That is accurate.", "Chair Nguyen: Does anyone else have any questions?", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: I want to clarify that last piece.", "When I look at the bill, NRS 442.029 through 442.2428 are the facilities we are talking about.", "There is a distinction between the facilities licensed by the state.", "I saw supportive living arrangements and hospices listed there as well as the independent center hospitals, homes for individual residential care, and halfway houses.", "Am I correct when I look at that list of defined medical facilities as the ones being included?", "Margot Chappel: Yes, to my knowledge, correct.", "Chair Nguyen: Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson, I can have our legal counsel follow up to confirm those are the facilities if you need me to.", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: I just want to make sure.", "Sometimes, when we talk about defined medical facilities, they can be different from what we might be thinking about.", "I think there are only two carve-outs in the medical facilities.",

intent.", "Chair Nguyen: Are there any other questions?", "[There were none.]", "We will now take callers from our public line in support, opposition, and neutral on A.B.", "217.", "[The Chair

among the stakeholders about which facility, which staff, what specific training, who was going to track it, and who was actually going to do the training.", "Some of the early discussions mentioned that all this training was going to be done by a registered nurse.", "That is problematic because we do not have enough nurses to take care of people in facilities let alone do all this training.", "There have been several studies talking about the who, what, where, when, how, and why.", "Looking at this bill, it allows the Department to look at which facilities we are talking about.", "We are not talking about the skilled staff in nursing homes or in hospitals.", "We are talking about these other places where there is staff who do provide some of level of care but about whom we are unsure what, if any, training they are receiving.", "That is really important.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 15, 2021 In 2017 I stated that Nevada is very good in some of these types of facilities as we fingerprint people, we do background checks on people, and we do tuberculosis tests on people.", "However, sometimes we do not do much more than that.", "We need to make sure that these people, if your mom or your dad or your grandmother were to go into one of these facilities, we would be comfortable knowing that the people who were going to help take care of them had some basic level of training on some basic care qualities.", "This bill is fabulous in terms of allowing those decisions, and there was a lot of talk with stakeholders about the best way to do this,

facility.\"", "\"Designated facilities\" is very broad to us, and we would like some clarity as to the facilities that are included.", "If it is all of them, that is good to know.", "The way it is written now, the \"designated facilities\" language is confusing to us.", "Regarding the training aspect of the bill, obviously cost is a factor.", "If there is free training, that is wonderful, and we hope that will be the case with this legislation.", "However, when you train employees, there is always a cost involved because of the time factor, so we would like to know more about the length of the training being hoped for in this legislation.", "Is the annual training just related to general cleanliness and sanitation\u2014such as restaurant-style training\u2014or is it a CDC training for

this not a conflict?", "I got a legal opinion from our staff concerning another appointment I was trying to make, but the person was already serving on a board and could not serve on more than one board at a time.", "Do the consortiums not fall under that?", "Dan Musgrove: The way the consortium is set up, it goes through the Administrator of DCFS, so DCFS has to approve every nomination that

of the board duties being recommendations and approving plans that could prevent placement of children.", "What is the intent of the word \"approve\"?", "Dan Musgrove: That question was also brought up to us by Clark County.", "It falls under that discussion I had about being a fiduciary.", "There is no doubt that we are very strong and passionate advocates when it comes to children, and there are times when we might disagree with the direction an agency might be taking.", "It will not be a blanket approval.", "As we advocate on behalf of these children, we bring priorities from all three

is an opportunity for us to be a part of decision-making and make sure they understand where the consortiums are coming from.", "That is what we saw as our approval.", "It does not mean we necessarily will approve it; it means we will take the opportunity to give them a pretty solid recommendation and that we will be passionate in our advocacy as to whatever our recommendation might have

Education, and DCFS\u2014if there is a dissenting vote where those three folks might vote to support a state measure because they are agents of the state, and then there are six votes that do not support the measure, then the board representation would be \"No.\"", "How much weight would that \"No\" carry in terms of whether a policy would go through the state?", "I wonder if the word \"recommendation\" alone covers that?", "I would not want the unintended consequence to be that, if the board voted something down, it would prevent the state from taking an action versus having a record that you were in opposition to that action.", "Do you understand what I mean?", "Dan Musgrove: That is an excellent point.", "I would have to review the statute, but I think we are advisory

instance, by this Legislature.", "I know you are not giving us that much authority.", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: If you got the authority, you would not give it away and neither would I.", "That

association might help us with the education as well; I agree that there needs to be an education component so they understand who can use the bathroom and under what conditions.", "Assemblywoman Titus: Thank you for that because I have significant concerns that we pass laws and now we are going to fine somebody, but they do not have a clue what it is all about.", "My next question concerns the cards.", "Will you go to your provider to get a card?", "Will the provider have to provide it or how will that process work?", "I know you already have those cards, but does everyone belong to that foundation?", "I have patients who do not share this information with everyone and do not necessarily belong to that foundation.", "Assemblywoman Gorelow: The Crohn's & Colitis Foundation has those cards and Jennifer Campbell will explain more about the process.", "In many other states, a quick letter from a doctor stating that there is a medical condition has been sufficient.", "Assemblywoman Titus: We already have health laws and we already have state regulations, especially for restaurants.", "Does this change that?", "Does it preempt existing rules and regulations?", "Assemblywoman Gorelow: I will have to talk to legal counsel about that.", "I do not anticipate that this would.", "Most restaurants have bathrooms; however, we are working with the Retail Association of Nevada concerning smaller ones that might just be take-out locations.", "In our discussions, pizza places were discussed, as many are small, mostly take-out locations and we are working with them on possibly carving out exemptions for some of the smaller ones.", "In some other states, Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 19, 2021 they exempted restaurants based on size.", "I do not have a concept of what square footage looks like, so I do not think that is the route we will go, but we are working with them so we can come to a compromise.", "Chair Nguyen: Are there other questions from Committee members before I take testimony in support, opposition, and neutral?", "Assemblywoman Peters: I want the copresenter to know I am grateful that you shared your story.", "When I was pregnant I had a couple of embarrassing morning sickness all-day-long scenarios where I had to go home and change.", "I had to bail on my business meeting, or my client dinner, or my day job to take care of myself.", "Things just change, and not everybody has the ability to make it to a restroom every time something comes on.", "I applaud you for sharing your story and normalizing the differences in our bodies.", "Thank you for bringing the bill.", "Chair Nguyen: Are there other questions or comments?", "Seeing none, we will take testimony in support, opposition, and neutral on A.B.", "283.", "We will begin with testimony in support of A.B.", "283.", "[There was none.]", "Do we have any callers in opposition to the bill?", "Leonard Stone, representing Nevada Justice Association: I am uncomfortable being in the category of opposition because in most ways, we are very supportive and applaud the compassionate efforts of this bill to protect a vulnerable population suffering from these life-altering medical conditions.", "We heard some excellent comments about the probable need to broaden the definitions of those medical conditions.", "I appreciated for example a moment ago the discussion about how pregnancy can lead to senses of urgency.", "That is one thing to consider.", "We have no opposition to section 1, subsection 1, because we think this is generally a good bill, but we strongly oppose subsection 2 which provides immunity to businesses unless they are willfully or grossly negligent.", "The reason we oppose this portion of the bill is it lowers the standard of care for this vulnerable population.", "The law is quite clear regarding a landowner's or lessee's obligations relative to the safety of land.", "Do not be negligent.", "Be reasonable, provide reasonably safe space.", "Basic negligence, in other words, reasonable conduct does not necessitate willful or grossly negligent conduct in order to be held accountable.", "We should not be sending a message and we certainly should not be passing a law that tells businesses they can relax on safety.", "Presumably, they already care about their employees who are using the space.", "Business owners and operators already have an obligation to maintain safe space.", "They should be equally, if not more, concerned about these vulnerable individuals.", "By raising the standard to willful and grossly negligent conduct, we are not adequately incentivizing these businesses to keep people safe.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 19, 2021 On the one hand, this is a great bill.", "We should be protecting people.", "On the other hand, in exchange for that, for this obligation we should have, which is compassion and empathy, it should not be in exchange for changing the standard of care and allowing spaces to be less safe.", "Bryan Wachter, Senior Vice President, Retail Association of Nevada: I appreciate Assemblywoman Gorelow bringing the bill forward and for working with us.", "We are in opposition to the bill as it is currently written, but we hope we will be able to get to a place where that will not be true any longer.", "We are ready and able to provide some notification to retailers in the state, but we might consider allowing the first instance to be a warning so that business has adequate notice going forward.", "We, of course, would oppose any changes to section 1, subsection 2.", "Amber Stidham, Vice President, Government Affairs, Henderson Chamber of Commerce: I, too, thank Assemblywoman Gorelow for reaching out to our organization on this bill.", "We are committed to working together with the Assemblywoman to address some of our concerns and finding a way that we can work this out.", "However, today, as the bill is written, we are opposed.", "Paul J. Moradkhan, Senior Vice President, Government Affairs, Vegas Chamber: I want to thank the bill's sponsor for meeting with the Vegas Chamber about the bill.", "Those conversations were productive.", "We understand the policy need at hand and are sympathetic to the issue.", "Our concerns with the bill are some technical components as we have shared with the bill's sponsor.", "For example, the broadness of the retail definition as it relates to our members because of some security and public health care concerns for certain industry sectors within Nevada's business communities.", "As we shared with the bill's sponsor, we believe there needs to be an exemption for certain groups, such as banks, credit unions, financial institutions, and they would not be included in the \"retail\" definition because of security concerns.", "We also have a concern for some of our smaller business restaurants that do not have a public-access bathroom and the customer would have to go through a food preparation area which would be in violation or an issue with local health district standards.", "We appreciate the bill's sponsor helping develop a solution to address those two sectors.", "We would have a concern about changes to section 1, subsection 2.", "We believe if we are mandated to open up back-of-the-house facility restrooms that we should not lose protection for that for the public to come through those areas.", "We will continue to work with the bill's sponsor, and it is our hope to quickly find a resolution to this bill.", "Again, we are sympathetic to the policy issue at hand.", "Alexandria Dazlich, Director, Government Affairs, Nevada Restaurant Association: We are here today in opposition to A.B.", "283 as it is currently written.", "A critical component of the restaurant industry is strong food safety practices.", "With this in mind, the Nevada Restaurant Association, as well as our local health districts, is concerned about the health and sanitation consequences this bill will open up.", "Some restaurants would be placed in the Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 19, 2021 middle of deciding between receiving a fine from the health district versus receiving a fine for not opening their bathroom.", "By allowing nonemployees back-of-the-house access where food is stored, prepared, and cooked, it quickly becomes a sanitation hazard that would have a potential impact on the health of its customers in addition to the safety of restaurant employees.", "By allowing patrons uninhibited access to areas like back of the house, kitchens, and food prep and storage areas, employees are also now susceptible to potential violence and harm from bad actors who take advantage of this privilege.", "It is for these reasons we are here today in opposition to the bill as it is currently written.", "We look forward to continuing to work with the sponsor and going forward and finding a resolution.", "Chair Nguyen: Are there other callers in opposition?", "[There were none.]", "Are there any callers in neutral?", "[There were none.]", "At this time, I will turn this back over to Assemblywoman Gorelow for any closing remarks.", "Assemblywoman Gorelow: Assembly Bill 283 is about dignity and making sure people are able to use the restroom when they have certain medical conditions.", "I want to thank Mr. Cimo and Ms. Campbell for joining us today and sharing their stories.", "And I want to thank everyone who called in in opposition.", "We have reached out to them and we are going to continue working.", "Hopefully, we can come to a mutual agreement on some of the language with this bill.", "It is our intent to allow people the dignity of going to the bathroom.", "Chair Nguyen: Several people have submitted written letters in support of A.B.", "283 [Exhibit E, Exhibit F, Exhibit G, Exhibit H, Exhibit I, and Exhibit J].", "I encourage you to check on NELIS [Nevada Electronic Legislative Information System] for those letters.", "I would remind any members of the public if you want to comment on either bill presented today, you have 48 hours in which to submit written support, letters, or documentation, and I would encourage you to do so.", "I will now close the hearing on A.B.", "283 and begin public comment.", "Is there anyone for public comment?", "Gerri North, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: I am

Education Association-Retired (NSEA-R) and the Clark Retired Education Association.", "As a retiree on a fixed income, I know rising health care costs are a continuous worry for many Americans.",

having no insurance increases their anxiety and contributes to depression.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 19, 2021 Many retired educators I have spoken with use smaller doses of maintenance meds, with or without doctor input, to make ends meet.", "They also put off procedures and surgeries.", "Workers who dedicate three or four decades to the state of Nevada deserve better.", "Please keep in mind active and retired state workers need access to affordable health care when they retire.", "Members of NSEA-R appreciate anything you can do to help contain the cost of health care and medicine.", "We hope you will consider a study to determine the status of state workers and steps that could be taken next session to ensure all Nevada workers have access to affordable health care and medicine in their golden years.", "Chair Nguyen: Thank you for your public comment.", "Do we have any other callers on the line for public comment?", "[There were none.]",

p.m. We are adjourned [at 1:51 p.m.].", "Chair Nguyen: [Roll was taken.", "The Chair reminded Committee members, witnesses, and members of the audience of Committee rules, protocol, and procedures for virtual meeting.]", "I will now open the hearing on Assembly Bill 44.", "Today we have with us Mason Van Houweling, CEO of University Medical Center, and I will turn it over to you.", "Assembly Bill 44: Revises provisions relating to county hospitals.", "(BDR 40-401) Mason Van Houweling, Chief Executive Officer, University Medical Center: As many of you are aware, University Medical Center (UMC) is one of the busiest hospitals in southern Nevada.", "Situated in the urban core, located in the heart of the Las Vegas medical district, the hospital serves as southern Nevada's safety net for residents and visitors alike.", "University Medical Center provides a number of services that are home and \"one-of-a-kind\" here at UMC, including the Level I Trauma Center, the Lions Burn Care Center, the Center for Transplantation, Children's Hospital of Nevada at UMC, and a Level II Pediatric Trauma Center.", "University Medical Center retains more than 4,000 employees and cares for hundreds of thousands of visitors and patients each year.", "In addition, UMC is affiliated with the University of Nevada, Las Vegas School of Medicine in the creation and pursuit of a career academic health center.", "Over the last year, UMC has played an integral role in the state of Nevada's COVID-19 response.", "Being the state's leader in COVID-19 testing, we have performed well over a million PCR [polymerase chain reaction] tests with result turnaround times of less than 12 hours.", "Now we have moved on to the next chapter in the COVID-19 vaccination efforts.", "As of right now, we have done 41,400 vaccinations to date.", "We are here to discuss Assembly Bill 44, a bill that is sponsored by Clark County and supports the mission of UMC to provide the highest level of care to our patients while ensuring exceptional quality and meeting our goal of being good taxpayer stewards of the taxpayer dollars.", "This bill serves two purposes.", "It codifies in Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) our UMC governing board.", "The governing board was created by Clark County ordinance in 2013.", "The governing board members are appointed by the Clark County Commission, which remains as UMC's hospital board of trustees and UMC's ultimate authority.", "In 2013, the commissioners had the foresight to recognize the importance of Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 22, 2021 having dedicated members of the community with specialized knowledge and skill sets to provide oversight and guidance with respect to daily management of hospital operations.", "As I know and members of this Committee understand, health care law and regulations are very complex and always evolving.", "The second purpose of A.B.", "44 is meant to address the complex, unique issues the hospital faces in health care\u2014issues around the regulatory environment.", "University Medical Center would like the ability to have frank and open conversations and dialogue with our board leaders, whether with the governing board or the actual board of hospital trustees.", "In fact, our licensing and regulatory and accreditation standards require us to ensure both of our boards are fully informed when making very difficult decisions.", "Whether it is the ability to have these private deliberations under other Nevada law, those procedures and those statutes can sometimes conflict.", "Furthermore, it can lead to delays informing our board earlier than we would like where there are proactive measures that can serve to improve the quality and care as we have discussed.", "To be clear, this bill does not allow for the governing board of any public hospital to take action or make decisions in a closed session.", "We have heard from various stakeholders since our bill was introduced.", "Throughout these discussions with our stakeholders, we understand that the original language in the bill early on was perhaps a little too broad.", "It did not clearly address those narrow instances where closed sessions and deliberations are needed.", "The amendment before you today is narrowly tailored to meet our needs [Exhibit C].", "Furthermore, we understand that the Nevada Rural Hospital Partners is seeking to introduce an amendment that will extend these opportunities to rural county hospitals as well so they can better address patient safety and quality concerns.", "We support our rural partners and their amendment as we believe that this bill would ensure that public hospitals across Nevada will have the same ability as private hospitals to address federal and state regulations aimed at providing safe and quality patient care.", "This bill will also serve as a safeguard to the Nevada taxpayers, an investment in their own public hospital by allowing a public hospital's governing board to proactively address any potential legal or regulatory issue.", "Adverse outcomes, costly fines, or protracted litigation can be avoided.", "This bill is not against transparency.", "University Medical Center's governing board will always be transparent in the decision-making process.", "This merely addresses the ability to deliberate and have discussions with our board members.", "All votes on matters will occur in open session in accordance with all existing requirements.", "We want to stress that we have been working with various stakeholders to address the concerns with this bill and we will continue to do so.", "We are more than willing to listen and work with everyone to find a suitable compromise for a final bill.", "Chair Nguyen: There are two amendments on the Nevada Electronic Legislative Information System (NELIS).", "Both amendments on NELIS are friendly, is that correct?", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 22, 2021 Mason Van Houweling: Yes, that is correct.", "Chair Nguyen: Committee members, I did have staff email those amendments to you this morning, and they are both on NELIS.", "We have a lot of questions, and we will start with Assemblywoman Thomas.", "Assemblywoman Thomas: Does this mean that UMC becomes a private/public entity?", "Mason Van Houweling: No, that is not correct.", "We celebrated 90 years of serving our community this year and will continue for the next 90 years as a public institution operating for the Clark County community.", "Assemblywoman Thomas: In reading this bill, the board of hospital trustees, which would be the county commissioners, would still be the hospital board of governors' bosses.", "Am I correct?", "Mason Van Houweling: Correct.", "That is not changing, it is codifying.", "Back in 2013, Clark County established UMC's governing board.", "The hospital board of trustees are the Clark County commissioners when it comes to hospital business; they are serving as hospital trustees.", "They have oversight of the UMC governing board, which are those community members.", "We meet monthly but there are four subcommittees under that board: finance, quality, strategy, and human resources.", "They meet often throughout the month and serve as the overall operating oversight at the hospital.", "Those governing board members report to the hospital trustees who are our Clark County commissioners.", "This would be codifying it in the NRS, which are already in the Clark County Code of Ordinances.", "Assemblywoman Thomas: How does this affect the union?", "Mason Van Houweling: There is no direct or indirect impact to the union.", "As I mentioned, any deliberations, votes, or decision-making always would occur in the public session.", "We have great attendance at our meetings with the union.", "I meet with them frequently, and our team meets with them frequently.", "I cannot see any direct or indirect impact to our union partners here at UMC.", "They are always welcome to our meetings and they frequently attend governing board meetings, the subcommittees, but also, if there is a need, hospital trustees' business matters that go in front of Clark County commissioners.", "They are often there supporting or making their voices heard.", "Usually, I am there with them side by side.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 22, 2021 Assemblywoman Thomas: My concern was the fact that the governing board would be tasked to make bylaws, changes, and things of that nature, and I was wondering how that would affect the union at UMC.", "Mason Van Houweling: Those would always be handled at the county commission level, again wearing their hospital trustee hats.", "They are very good at switching from Clark County Commission business to hospital business.", "There would be no changes to bylaws that would come out of a closed session within UMC.", "All those decisions, any votes, are always done in the public eye, properly noticed, vetted out, and discussions made\u2014nothing that I would see that would directly impact the union with this particular bill.", "Assemblywoman Thomas: In your presentation you mentioned that A.B.", "44 would prevent litigation.", "How is that possible?", "Mason Van Houweling: It would not prevent litigation, but it would perhaps minimize protracted litigation.", "It would allow us to inform our board of any potential regulatory litigation issues sooner than later to be able to address those matters.", "Again, everything would be properly done, done throughout the process in an open decision, but it would allow us to be more proactive on litigation matters and also in protecting our patients and our employees.", "Assemblywoman Peters: It is my understanding that there are already some protections for closed meetings, discussions in certain cases and scenarios.", "Can you talk about those and the difference this bill will make to those scenarios and why this is particularly needed if we already have some protections for other specific scenarios.", "Mason Van Houweling: I may lean on our general counsel for this one.", "There are instances when we have been going into closed session, particularly concerning litigation matters, but I would prefer that our general counsel, Ms. Pitz, answer that question.", "Susan Pitz, General Counsel, University Medical Center: Yes, there are other areas and other statutes where you can go into closed session; for example, to talk about the competency and conduct of practitioners.", "There, you would follow the procedure under that statute.", "Here, we are trying to put that ability under NRS Chapter 450, which is specific to running a hospital, so that we can follow our specific procedures related to that.", "The medical board has done similar in NRS Chapter 630 where they make references to this and following their procedure, as has state's mental health and the Commission on Behavioral Health's statute under NRS Chapter 433.", "Assemblywoman Peters: By running the hospital, can you give us a couple of examples of where this is important?", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 22, 2021 Susan Pitz: Part of why we made the amendment to specifically reference review committees under NRS Chapter 49 is practitioners reviewing practitioners\u2014peer review.", "When you are doing peer review in a hospital setting with physicians, it is important that the peers review each other.", "The hearing, the witnesses, the testimony, all get done with a panel of their peers.", "It is that setting when I see us using this the most\u2014being able to do that hearing, call witnesses, and take testimony at the peer level.", "Then when it gets up to the governing board level, they are just reviewing the record and not providing a full new hearing.", "Assemblywoman Peters: That peer review practice does not have confidential components that are already protected under statute?", "Susan Pitz: Yes, it absolutely does have confidential and privileged information.", "That is in the review committee statute in NRS Chapter 49, but that is not going to evolve at that level.", "It is not involving any public official employment.", "Assemblywoman Peters: I am having a hard time tracking where this particular piece comes into play in the importance for the hospital.", "Could you narrow that down for me?", "What is missing right now?", "What do you not have?", "Maybe I am not understanding, but I need a little more discussion about that.", "Susan Pitz: Using that example of peer review and practitioner review, it has long been recognized in Nevada law that to get physicians to participate in peer review, to look at the role of other physicians in instances where maybe they did not do the best or there was an adverse outcome, they review each other at that level.", "It is at the hospital that was actually involving our medical staff, which is an independent entity though it is under UMC.", "It is a group of physicians who are elected who meet and discuss these issues.", "What happens with all hospitals is you have this peer review at the medical-staff level and the fair hearing panel of the peers.", "But the ultimate decision, according to health care laws and regulations, needs to be approved, so the medical staff or the fair hearing panel may make a recommendation, for example, that privileges are revoked.", "In every instance in hospitals, it has to go up to the board to approve that recommendation.", "Here, our board happens to be a public board, so if the public board had questions about the record that might include that sensitive information that was at the peer review, they would be doing that in open meeting or they would be going under NRS Chapter 241.", "While we have done that in the past and continue to do that, it does not follow the same procedure we would like to do under NRS Chapter 450.", "That is the missing piece we are looking to solve here.", "Assemblywoman Peters: Thank you, that makes sense.", "So there is a very narrow place where this would affect how you are able to run the review of issues within the hospital.", "Looking at your amendment, it Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 22, 2021 says to discuss \"Matters .", ".", ".", "including, without limitation, deliberations of the character, alleged misconduct, professional competence, or physical or mental health of a provider of health care.\"", "So that is the scenario you are talking about, the peer review piece.", "Susan Pitz: Correct.", "Assemblywoman Peters: And then the second is, \"Reports related to the compliance of the hospital with all laws, regulations, rulemaking guidance of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or with any conditions of participation in the Medicare or Medicaid program.\"", "Can you describe a scenario in which that is applicable?", "Susan Pitz: As a hospital, we are licensed and accredited by a number of different bodies both on the state and federal level.", "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has oversight over the Medicare and Medicaid programs.", "Obviously at UMC, we take Medicare and Medicaid.", "To be able to take Medicare and Medicaid, you have to follow certain rules of CMS in their conditions of participation.", "They expect, and part of those conditions of participation is, that you have a fully informed board, that you are bringing any issues to them that you are policing yourself, much like in the peer-review setting in which physicians are tasked with policing themselves.", "In a hospital that is a CMS provider, you are expected to police yourself and report those issues to a fully informed board.", "That is what we are looking to address.", "In this amendment, we tried to narrow that and we will continue to try to narrow that.", "That is what we are trying to accomplish.", "Assemblywoman Peters: I appreciate your entertaining these questions and talking about the specific scenarios, but I may have more questions as we go along.", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: My question concerns the amendment.", "As I read section 1, subsection 5, any conversations and supporting records and transcripts for those closed meetings will be outside that five-year rule in which it has to become public so they will indefinitely remain not public records.", "Is that right?", "Mason Van Houweling: Correct.", "Those would become public after five years unless they are privileged and confidential.", "You have read that correctly.", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: I worry about the need for this.", "In other statutes, even information that is held outside of public record, even some of the most sensitive records indeed do become public after about 30 years or so.", "Could you talk about why you would need perpetual protection around this information?", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 22, 2021 Susan Pitz: Because five years was already in NRS Chapter 450 related to the other closed sessions that we have; we kept that.", "So actually, it is saying that we will turn it over, that it would be open to public record after five years unless it is privileged, which is how existing law is now\u2014if it is privileged once, it is privileged for all time.", "In instances where it is not privileged, like some of those issues I was speaking about with Assemblywoman Peters, CMS-type issues, those would not necessarily hold a privilege and would be subject to disclosure after five years.", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: I see you are keeping the five years in there whenever you use NRS 49.117 or 49.265 in the way you use it now.", "However, if your board deems that you need to have that perpetual protection, then it will fall outside that five years.", "Am I misunderstanding that, or is it really just five years for everything?", "Susan Pitz: Yes, I believe it is meant to be and we can certainly look at the language if it is not clear on its face.", "It is meant to be that everything is subject to being open in five years unless it holds a privilege.", "Those review committees under NRS Chapter 49 would hold that privilege, but anything else would not necessarily hold that privilege, so it would be open.", "We are not looking to keep that perpetually protected.", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: I know you are referencing some of the CMS conditions of participation.", "For the legislative record I would feel more comfortable if you could get to us what specific pieces of CMS data collection you are concerned about.", "So much of that is aggregate data.", "I cannot think of a time when you are really getting into protected health information at the aggregate level once you start collecting data.", "You might have more of those conversations at a different level, but I think I need help with what you specifically mean\u2014whether it is sentinel events\u2014and then some examples where you have run into problems with the data collection piece, satisfying CMS, and the inability to provide information because of a sensitivity to public health records.", "That would help it be more concrete for me as I am trying to understand this.", "I have additional questions about section 2, but I will hold onto them and let the conversation continue.", "Assemblywoman Titus: Having been on the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, on the peer review committee when it was in existence for the entire state, and having served as chief of staff for a hospital, I have been involved in lots of peer review cases.", "They are not bad, they are not good, they are something that has to happen in standard of care.", "For clarification, charts get peer-reviewed that fall into certain categories; for instance, if you transfer a patient out of the emergency room within 24 hours, if someone dies in a certain stay, if someone leaves AMA [against medical advice], all those are subject to peer review by standard.", "It does not mean that there is anything good or bad, it is just that they fall into a category where they would Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 22, 2021 be reviewed.", "Frequently I would look at those, determine they had met standard of care, end of story.", "This law, NRS 450.140, already exists.", "It already reads that the board of trustees has this ability, but what you are adding here is the language \"or any hospital governing board\" because it is different between county hospitals, rural hospitals, and private hospitals.", "Is this adding a clarification on covering for all hospitals and not just those with a board of hospital trustees?", "Susan Pitz: Yes, the language you are reading is a clarification that a board of hospital trustees can go into closed session and so can its appointed and delegated governing board.", "We are trying to make a clarification there with that language.", "Assemblywoman Titus: That is in section 1, subsection 3.", "Looking at section 2, subsection 1, what we are adding here are counties because many counties do not have hospital trustees.", "\"In counties in which the board of hospital trustees appoints a hospital governing board .", ".", ".", ",\" which is a different structure.", "It is clarifying that they may also be \"exercising powers and duties delegated to the governing board .", ".", ".", ".\"", "There are different ways of organizing hospital structure.", "The way I am looking at this bill, it clarifies that all those levels of structure would be included in being able to have that peer review in certain situations already afforded in general language.", "Is that how I am reading this?", "Susan Pitz: Absolutely.", "If you look at the language in section 2 that talks about NRS 450.175, it states that \"In counties in which the board of hospital trustees appoints a hospital governing board, the governing board is the governing body of the county hospital when exercising powers and duties delegated to the governing board pursuant to this chapter.\"", "What that is saying is that whoever is the delegated authority and whichever structure you are under, when they are taking action, they have the authority to take the action.", "Throughout the NRS it uses the term \"governing body,\" so at times that can be confusing\u2014whether or not you are talking about the board of hospital trustees, the governing board, either one.", "Whoever has the authority to take that action is the governing body for that matter.", "Assemblywoman Titus: I see this as clarifying language to statutes that already exist under the many different conditions of hospitals.", "We have to allow those who do conduct peer review to do their jobs, which, as the opening statement said, will help for patients' overall outcomes and patient protection.", "Thank you for bringing the bill forward.", "Chair Nguyen: What do \"privileged\" and \"confidential\" mean within the context of this statute?", "Is that similar language you are trying to capture that applies to other hospital facilities right now?", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 22, 2021 Susan Pitz: In the amended language at section 1, subsection 3, paragraph (c), we specifically called up NRS Chapter 49 because various stakeholders asked us to narrow the bill and get to what we were really trying to address.", "In NRS Chapter 49, those references, that is \"confidential and privileged\" conversations and materials that are used in those peer review settings.", "Chair Nguyen: It appears to me that the board gets to determine what is \"privileged.\"", "Am I reading that incorrectly or is that how the process takes place?", "Susan Pitz: I do not believe the board determines what is privileged.", "If it is part of a review committee proceeding that fits under NRS Chapter 49, it is privileged.", "Unless, of course, like any privilege, it is somehow waived.", "Chair Nguyen: Under current law, it does not allow for privileged information to avoid this disclosure after five years.", "Is that correct?", "Susan Pitz: Yes, that is correct.", "We wanted to because existing law in NRS has that five-year requirement if we went into closed session.", "It would be available for me to request that information and supporting materials.", "We wanted to make clear that it would apply here, but if something is privileged, it is still going to maintain that privilege.", "We did not want it to be read as a waiver of any privilege after a certain period of time.", "Chair Nguyen: So the board determines that it is privileged, then they can waive that five years?", "Susan Pitz: It was intended to

language of this bill if the committee determines that the information is privileged.", "In existing law, it must be disclosed after five years; now, there would be no disclosure.", "What this means is that people who have been wronged by the hospital will be unlikely to find out any relevant information as to why they were wronged, who was responsible for the wrong, as the five years far exceeds

competence, just what Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 24, 2021 this first-time mom needed to get through pregnancy and delivery while living over 5,000 miles from my mom, who would not be able to attend the birth.", "Our first meeting was at my house with my landlord's wife as an interpreter.", "Frau Busse asked lots of questions and made suggestions on room temperature, baby bed, and how much time to put the baby in the window each day to get sunlight.", "In the weeks before delivery, I attended Lamaze and La Leche League classes at her home.", "She was my rock throughout the birthing process.", "Epidurals were not common practice there.", "Frau Busse got me through the birth process with breathing, concentration, touch, and encouragement.", "She visited me every day in the hospital after I gave birth.", "I am telling you this story to illustrate the difference it can make when a mom has support before, during, and after delivery.", "Current best practice is to have a nonmedical doula providing support solely for the mom while the midwife or physician delivers and cares for the baby.", "I was lucky to have had an extremely skilled midwife who was able to attend me in the delivery room.", "If there had been any complications, her attention would have shifted, and rightfully so, to the baby and away from me.", "The goal of this bill is to ensure that both mom and baby have the individualized support they need throughout the entire birth process.", "At this time, I will hand the presentation over to Quentin Savwoir so he can explain how

me.", "It devastated me because I could not help but think of all the new babies born into this world who would not have their mothers.", "I was overcome with grief, wondering how many new Nevadans would not immediately know the fierce protection, unconditional love, and comforting warmth of their mama.", "It did not take long for us to find out that the national trends we are facing as a

able to dig a little deeper.", "It was in these conversations that we learned the troubling reality that postpartum has on parents.", "The Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 24,

a parent through.", "In these same conversations, nearly one-third of our participants reported not having access to prenatal care or prenatal services at all.", "Finally, these conversations with our community members revealed that doulas would be the most helpful resource during pregnancy, alongside parenting classes and resources to help with postpartum depression.", "Our research and

outcomes, ensuring new Nevada children are getting a healthy and thriving start, and serve as a cost-saving measure for our state.", "Assembly Bill 256 is community-driven policy that, at its core, is about our Nevada children.", "What kind of Nevada do we want to see them born into?", "Hopefully, it is one where we see the value in their life before they even arrive.", "Hopefully, it is one where

and ease, instead of trauma and stress.", "We can do something about this, and we should.", "Alexandra Gunter, Doula, Reno Doula Project: The Reno Doula Project was started in 2012 as a way to help mothers gain access to doulas.", "Historically, having a doula was a thing of privilege reserved for the upper class.", "Through the Reno Doula Project, we have been able to close this gap and increase access to doulas by reducing the cost through an income-based sliding scale, ensuring that women of all income levels are able to hire doulas.", "There is no doubt that doulas provide a necessary service.", "Women who have doulas attend their births have lower rates of unnecessary interventions during their labors and higher rates of birthing satisfaction.", "More importantly, births attended by doulas have fewer neonatal intensive care unit admissions, higher rates of breastfeeding initiation, and a longer duration of breastfeeding.", "In Nevada, only 21 percent of our infants are still exclusively nursing at six months, when breast milk can be both lifesaving and cost-saving for Nevada families.", "We need to do anything we can to support that.", "In addition to the Reno

honor of accepting a sponsorship from Anthem Medicaid to provide 50 of their members with doulas starting in 2021.", "Anthem has put their money where their mouth is, both in terms of considering

health outcomes and quality of care, but also increasing cost savings [page 5].", "This is the Cochrane analysis, which shows that not only are doulas effective in decreasing cesarean births, almost by 30 percent, and preterm births, as well as other expensive and high-touch intervention such as vacuum extractions and epidurals [page 7], but it also increases the self-reports of clients who say they have more positive birth experiences with doulas.", "When we factor in cost-saving potential, just factoring in the primary cesarean rate by reducing unnecessary primary cesareans, it reflects at least $15 million of projected savings a year.", "That is not including subsequent cesareans, costs associated with preterm births, and other high-cost interventions such as epidurals, et cetera.", "I hope you will see that there is extensive evidence that backs up doulas as an intervention that meets the triple aim.", "A recent Cochrane Systemic Review indicated that all women Assembly Committee

as I had my three children and watched my friends have their children, how important doula services were to the well-being of the moms in those cases.", "Not everyone has a great relationship with their mom, or their sister, or their aunt, or even have them left.", "Sometimes you just need that support.", "It was invaluable for me.", "I had my sister in my case, but I do not know what I would have done without that support during my three births.", "My question has to with the kind of training standards that already exist.", "Doulas go through a process of learning how to be effective in the space they offer services in.", "Can you talk a bit about what those training standards look like and what the breadth of services doulas are hired for can look like?", "Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: Ms. Gunter, would you please speak to your scope at the Reno Doula Project?", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 24, 2021 Alexandra Gunter: There are a lot of training associations.", "Because doulas are not regulated, the trainings are not regulated, but they typically follow a similar format.", "It is a multiday workshop where we talk about what to cover during prenatals, how to stay within scope of practice during labor, how to act and conduct yourself during a hospital birth and during a home birth, also knowing that we are not doing unassisted births so there is always a medical professional there.", "Also going over red flags for postpartum.", "When doulas first came about in the United States, it was for the white and privileged, so numerous associations have created trainings that cover racial disparities.", "There are trainings by Black women for Black women and other women of color.", "Now there are even more trainings available, so it would be hard to say, \"only one training\" or \"only these trainings are acceptable.\"", "Certification is similar.", "Because doulas are not regulated, there is no way to know what a certification truly means.", "Again, making sure that whatever training association a doula is in, it at least covers scope of practice and at least covers certain aspects would be more important than making sure that each individual doula is certified or making sure that the trainings themselves are regulated.", "There is a lot of work to be done in that area, but I have a lot of faith in the trainings that are in existence already.", "Assemblywoman Peters: The thing that is really important to talk about is that not every person needs exactly the same thing and it is not like a math equation\u2014it is really about those personal relationships\u2014interviewing your provider for that service just like any other service you would ask for in the spectrum of your life.", "It is not a one-size-fits-all for everyone, and I think that is really valuable to have in the community.", "My other question concerns the breadth of service.", "I know from my pregnancies that prenatal care was very specific about my baby and about my health, but the postpartum care was virtually nonexistent.", "Can you talk a bit about how you provide services both before, during, and after and how that can be unique to each service scenario?", "Alexandra Gunter: A typical model of care would be two prenatal appointments\u2014not including an interview\u2014so two prenatal appointments, the birth itself, and one postpartum visit.", "It is one postpartum visit at a minimum.", "You can, of course, add more.", "The postpartum visit typically happens about a week or, hopefully, two weeks after the birth.", "Doulas are not medically trained, but some of us are lactation professionals.", "We are not all lactation professionals; however, we are trained to notice red flags and to refer out.", "A lot of times, that friendship, that relationship you create with your doula, has them checking in on the mom more often via text message or phone conversations, depending on what the mom wants.", "Typically, it is one postnatal visit which usually happens before the postnatal visit with the obstetrician, so there is the ability to notice red flags before they would be seen in-office by a medical professional.", "They would then be encouraged to see their medical professional early.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 24, 2021 Assemblywoman Peters: What is important about this conversation is that doulas provide a unique and individualized service to people depending on what they need and to expecting parents depending on what they need.", "That can be a wraparound service complementary to the medical help and medical providers' services that are also regulated and taken into account and paid for through insurance processes during that birthing process.", "That is really important.", "One of the pieces we are just starting to fully acknowledge in the birthing community is the importance of mental health postnatal\u2014mental health of moms and other parents.", "Without someone who can identify that or who is trained to identify that, it really leaves our populations vulnerable to those unexpected senses of depression that I know from experience you do not always see from the inside.", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: I have to admit, I am very naive concerning what a doula is and what they do.", "I am learning a lot.", "I believe I heard it said that doulas exist and that there is a certification process for them.", "I am assuming the community self-regulates and the community self-identifies.", "Is that how that is right now?", "Alexandra Gunter: Yes, I would say that we do self-regulate, and it is fairly important to self-regulate because we, as individuals, can be kicked out of a hospital and told not to come back as a doula.", "It could also negatively impact the reputation of the association we are under.", "Someone could say \"We do not want any doulas from your association because they break rules, they do x, y, and z.\"", "It is very important that we are recognized as professionals and not to overstep.", "Of course, if we were to try to do a medical procedure, try to assess cervical dilation, tell a doctor they are wrong or to stop in the middle of a medical procedure, we could be trespassed from the hospital and asked to leave.", "We are very self-regulating to make sure we do not ruin the reputation of those who are trying to do very important work.", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: I am a licensed social worker.", "This is not calling for licensing, it is calling for registration.", "For most folks where there would be licensure, you are not allowed to represent yourself as being a member of the profession unless you were licensed as such.", "Regardless of your education and training in something, unless you are licensed, you will not be able to represent yourself as such, nor to hang out a shingle saying you were such.", "Would you want the same intent for this registration?", "If you were registered and had met the requirements that the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department of Health and Human Services puts out, would you then be able to represent yourself as a doula but those who are not registered would not be able to?", "Alexandra Gunter: I can see a situation where a registered doula will be very important, but in terms of a certified doula, that depends on the educational body you attended.", "For some associations, there are yearly fees and certain follow-up continuing education that for some women, especially lower-income women who are trying to make a living as doulas, can be prohibitive Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 24, 2021 to remaining a certified doula.", "I never certified as a birth doula, and I consider myself to still be an expert in this area.", "Having registered doulas within the state of Nevada so we can get reimbursement from Medicaid sounds completely reasonable, but in terms of requiring certification from the many different training bodies\u2014because we are not regulated like a social worker or like a clinical psychologist\u2014it does not look the same, so I do not think it would have the same effects.", "Quentin Savwoir: I wanted to add to what Alexandra Gunter was saying.", "I want to be careful about the language we are using.", "I know there is a lot of conversation in the Legislature [unintelligible].", "Assemblywoman Peters: I am having a lot of trouble understanding what you are saying.", "I do not know if it is the microphone, but I missed most of what you said.", "Chair Nguyen: I agree.", "Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: Mr. Savwoir, if you would turn off your camera, that might help.", "You may be having some issues with the Internet.", "Quentin Savwoir: I want to be very clear about the language we are using.", "What we are saying is we want doulas in the state to provide training, and we want them to provide documentation of training, for instance the training Ms. Gunter described\u2014the multiday training where they are taught how to identify things that would need to be escalated to a medical professional.", "Again, this is a nonmedical role that is providing education, advocacy, emotional support, and all things we would be doing for our friends, for our family, just in a dynamic where you are having to coach an expectant parent or mother through their pregnancy process.", "Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: I had my last child in a hospital setting with folks who were certified and registered.", "I had a standard U.S.A. birth, and my youngest son was born healthy, we thought.", "Those folks who were certified and trained and who were supposed to take care of me and him set us up in a room that was freezing cold.", "He ended up under a heat lamp for six days because he got hypothermia.", "I think we need to make sure we are not conflating these roles.", "This is a support person for the mom.", "She is not a medical professional and we do not see anywhere any need for he or she to be certified, but registered, some type of process set up so there is training that is both culturally competent, that completely covers the scope of what we want birth doulas to do.", "We have amazing and intelligent women in our state who are in this space.", "They are more than able to work together with our government officials to come up with a scope of training that needs to be done so they can do this work for moms.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 24, 2021 Assemblywoman Krasner: My question is for Ms. Gunter.", "You were talking about doulas being able to help diagnose postpartum or mental health.", "Could you expand on that?", "Alexandra Gunter: We are not qualified to give an assessment, but we can point women into the direction of assessments, like the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, for example.", "We can say, \"Why not fill this out?", "If you test in a particular way, it might be important to have a conversation with your provider about this.\"", "We are trained to recognize different types of perinatal mental health issues, so if we notice something, we are also able to point out that something may not necessarily be normal, and ask, \"Do you think you need help in this area, or do you think perhaps getting in touch with a therapist or getting some group therapy, some support circles, could help you in this area?\"", "Again, we are being very careful in our language when we speak to moms to not diagnose, to not say things like, \"You have depression.\"", "We can say, \"You know, this is not necessarily normal.", "Postpartum depression is something that could be happening in this situation; do you think you might want to explore this more with a professional?\"", "Staying within our scope has a lot to do with language and how we present things to moms, but definitely, mental health is a component of what we focus on, both prenatally and postpartum.", "Lauren Kalogridis: That is the exact intersection of a lot of my work, because I am a clinical social work intern, so I work as a perinatal psychotherapist treating clients with perinatal mood and anxiety disorders and anxiety depression.", "I also work as a doula, so the way I might describe the difference between the two is that they are not diagnosing, but they are noticing red flags.", "The beauty of a doula is that they are oftentimes in the home, oftentimes they have access to partners, oftentimes clients will end up sharing things about their experience emotionally with their doula prior to being able to be vulnerable with a therapist, and so they are getting inside information.", "What they probably need to do is just notice what is normal and what is not normal.", "In Reno, we have done a lot of work recently, with Thrive Wellness of Reno particularly, in establishing really strong and swift referral systems between the Reno Doula Project, Bright Heart, and other doulas in the area with our mental health providers.", "If the doula sees something escalating quite quickly, they can reach out and say we need some intervention, some mental health interventions quickly.", "Twenty percent of people experience perinatal mood and anxiety disorder.", "That is quite underreported.", "The quicker we can get them into care, the better chance we have at intervening to protect the bonding and attachment experience between parents and children because that is so crucial and can escalate very swiftly into a number of adverse childhood experiences we see related to untreated perinatal mood and anxiety disorders.", "I hope that spoke to the bridge, but the distinction.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 24, 2021 Assemblywoman Krasner: I thought in the presentation they said that doulas are not certified, some are registered, and some are not.", "Some have the training, and some do not.", "If they are not all certified or all registered, and they are not all receiving the same training, how do we know they are able to spot these mental health issues or postpartum issues?", "Maybe one thinks it is and makes a report that is false, and the person is really not having a mental health issue.", "Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: Ms. Kalogridis, you have worked both here and in New York.", "Could you speak to the scope of training you have seen in both locales?", "Lauren Kalogridis: As far as the scope of training, topics that are generally covered as standard practice\u2014for example, Dona International is one of the largest doula training organizations in the country.", "The downside of an organization like that is that it often does not have the culturally humble lens and the culturally sensitive lens that is so rooted in community issues, particularly in terms of the maternal mortality crisis for women of color and things like that.", "Just because there are differences in topics reflected in the different training orgs\u2014for example, in New York I trained under the org called Ancient Song Doula Services.", "Ancient Song covered all the same things as Dona International, things like comfort measures, things like positions of the baby in utero, things like education about common scenarios in labor and helping people think through what their birth preferences would be, basics of breast feeding, things like that.", "In addition to all those standard core content areas, they also talked about the Black maternal mortality crisis in this country and the way that rates of sexual violence can show up to impact different communities more.", "Part of the specifics about trying not to narrow in, saying, \"we need you to certify under this one doula training organization,\" is that sometimes there is a risk of not meeting the whole needs of the community.", "I think that is what folks were speaking to earlier.", "As far as the piece around the risk of referring someone who might not actually have a perinatal mood and anxiety disorder\u2014it is about preventive care in a lot of ways.", "There is not actually a detriment in the way that I see it as a mental health care professional, but if someone is getting to us, part of our job is to do the assessment.", "It is not the doula's job, it is our job to ask if a person needs case management services, do you need WIC [Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children], do you need outpatient therapy, do you need intense outpatient therapy?", "That is our scope of practice as a mental health professional, and we welcome people getting them to us even if the person is not in a full-blown perinatal mood and anxiety disorder stage.", "Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: Assemblywoman Krasner, she is speaking about her role as a social worker, being able to do the diagnosis\u2014that is her role.", "She is interested in and encouraging the role that the doula, who has a relationship with that mom, may be able to see that there are issues that may need to be addressed and to have that relationship built that she can move her into the space of a health care professional to get her what she may want or may need.", "When we are talking Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 24, 2021 about the scope of the doula service, that doula is going to see that mom within the first or second week after the baby is born.", "Generally speaking, the post-birth appointment with the doctor is weeks out, and many things can happen, as far as mental health or any other situation, in between then.", "That doula has access to that mom; they have a relationship.", "That doula can assess the differences, they have that type of core training, and move that mom along to a professional so there can be an intervention before it becomes a crisis.", "Assemblyman Hafen: It was stated that there were approximately two dozen other states that are doing this reimbursement.", "Could you provide us with a breakdown of which states are requiring registered doulas versus certified doulas?", "I am curious to see what the other states are doing in that regard.", "Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: We will gather some data and get it out to the entire Committee.", "Quentin Savwoir: We are happy to follow up with the entire Committee with the information you requested, Assemblyman Hafen.", "I want to clarify that we are using a lot of terms, and I do not want the intention of the legislation to be confused.", "The registration we are discussing is for the purposes of Nevada's Medicaid Services office for purposes of accountability of how the funds are being spent.", "\"Registration\" in this legislation is talking about registering with the office of Medicaid within DHHS.", "Other states have set forth other provisions and have required doulas to be certified or licensed.", "That is not what we are proposing.", "There has been research that has proven that when you create additional barriers to entry, it does lack cultural competency and the trainings associated to help Black and Brown women and Native American women proves that consistently across all the studies.", "Again, I am happy to research and follow up with the Committee, but I want to make sure that we are using the proper terminology so we are not confusing the intention of what we are hoping to accomplish with Assembly Bill 256.", "Assemblyman Hafen: I want to make sure my question is very clear.", "In section 1, subsection 1, we are directing the director to address the \"registered\" doulas.", "In there it is very specific that this is for \"registered\" doulas, so my question is, what are other states doing?", "Are they doing the registered doula or are they doing the certified doulas, and that is the information I am requesting.", "Chair Nguyen: I am sure Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong will get that information to Patrick Ashton, our committee policy analyst, and he will distribute it to the rest of the Committee.", "Assemblywoman Peters: I really appreciate this conversation and discussion

health; there is no one exclusively there to focus on the mom's well-being.", "As the mother of three kids, in the first three days after my babies were born, no one asked how I was doing.", "It was always about the baby.", "Having a doula who was specifically there, hired by the mom, to support her in those sometimes traumatic and vulnerable moments, is so important for the health and well-being

services.", "Many studies have shown that doulas can assist in reducing preterm births, number of low-birth-weight babies, morbidity, mortality rates, neonatal intensive care unit admissions, depression, and anxiety.", "These studies have also shown us that doulas can assist with improving outcomes for mothers and babies with reduced cesarean rates by providing labor support toward a vaginal birth, decreased use of pain relief medications, and increased breastfeeding rates.", "All these outcomes help improve health care outcomes, lower health care costs, increase quality of care, and may even reduce health care disparities.", "Nevada Medicaid utilized many doula studies and the cost savings to Medicaid programs.", "Reviewing all of these, our analysis used the cost-saving methodologies in these studies to determine there would be a cost savings to Nevada Medicaid if we reimbursed doulas for their services.", "Overall, I am really pleased to say that our analysis

would be a cost saving.", "Additionally, as DuAne Young stated, the Division is also working with the bill's sponsor on the portion of the bill regarding oversight for registration for doulas.", "We are looking at how to figure that out.", "Also, I wanted to help answer the question about CPT codes.", "Even though we have not developed a policy and CPT codes to be billed like other states such as Oregon that have doulas, they have them bill their Medicaid program based upon the type of Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 24, 2021 delivery\u2014whether it was a vaginal delivery, vaginal that turned into a cesarean, or vaginal after a previous cesarean\u2014all those have different CPT codes.", "That would allow the Medicaid program to tie the doula to the type of birth that actually occurred.", "Even though it would have the same type of reimbursement, it would help tie the service provided to the outcome.", "Chair Nguyen: Ms. Lynch, will you please stay on the line?", "I know you are here to provide neutral testimony.", "Does anyone have any questions for Ms. Lynch?", "Assemblywoman Titus: You just testified that you are estimating a $1.2 million savings.", "Is that based on national data or are you using Nevada's data?", "We already have doulas here.", "Do you have any studies done in the state of Nevada that would be relevant?", "It sounds as though we have a significant population of doulas already who are involved in the process.", "Also, do you have a fixed number that you would pay a doula?", "It sounds as though if there were bad outcomes, they would be paid more.", "For instance, if they ended up having a cesarean section, are you now going to stratify that and pay them more?", "I am curious about where you got your figures.", "Erin Lynch: We looked at national studies on Medicaid and applied those cost savings using Nevada Medicaid data.", "If it said that the national studies helped reduce Medicaid costs by $1,500 per birth, then we applied that to the number of births that occur in Nevada.", "Also, national studies say that only about 6 percent of births are attended by doulas, so we applied that type

studies done using a doula versus a coach?", "Certainly, if you have a loved one, a parent, or a coach there, versus no one at all, but what is the end number?", "How many did it really serve?", "I really researched this issue before this testimony today trying to find some actual factual double-blind studies and the end numbers.", "If you have that information, I would love to see it.", "Chair Nguyen: Obviously, we put you on the spot, but would you provide that information to Assemblywoman Titus?", "Obviously, with this data collection it is premature at this time, and I understand that

Health and Human Services bill that did the same thing when I saw that Speaker Frierson had also submitted this bill, so we were thinking alike.", "With me today is Richard Whitley, Director of the Department of Health and Human Services; Suzanne Bierman, Administrator of the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy; and Robert Thompson, Deputy Administrator of Program and Field Services for the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 29, 2021 I want to give you some information about the intent of A.B.", "358.", "It is to improve care transitions to the community for incarcerated individuals who are eligible for Medicaid.", "Let me give you some background.", "Individuals who are incarcerated often have significant physical and mental health care needs.", "For example, they may experience chronic and infectious diseases such as hepatitis C, and they may suffer from severe mental health and substance use disorders and other physical health issues associated with mental health and substance use disorders.", "And they occur at a much higher rate than in our general population.", "The COVID-19 pandemic showed us how vulnerable many of these individuals are, and many suffered from this horrible disease while incarcerated when we had severe outbreaks in our prisons.", "We want to improve health care for individuals who are recently released from prison.", "This action in this bill will help improve health in our communities, lower spending of state health care, and potentially advance public safety goals such as successful reentry and reduced recidivism.", "Currently, we have many individuals in our criminal justice system who qualify for Medicaid, especially since Nevada expanded eligibility for low-income adults through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.", "Medicaid has a key role in providing support to these individuals, and as you know, people who are incarcerated are often disproportionately poor and people of color.", "This bill also helps address some of those health care inequities while advancing health care and racial equity in our state.", "As of 2019, 43 states\u2014so we would be asking to join those 43 states\u2014already have a policy or have enacted policies that suspend Medicaid eligibility for an individual person while in prison, and 42 states had a policy to suspend eligibility for an eligible person while in jail.", "Six additional states are considering this policy, including us here today with A.B.", "358.", "This bill provides that same policy to suspend Medicaid while someone is incarcerated, rather than terminate them from Medicaid when they are sent to prison.", "Section 1 of the bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to suspend, rather than terminate, Medicaid eligibility of an individual who is incarcerated.", "If an individual is not eligible for Medicaid, or if eligibility was terminated prior to incarceration, he or she can apply for Medicaid up to half a year before his or her scheduled release date.", "I am sure my copresenters will talk about the cost savings we will have, as well as the continuity of medical care upon their release from prison.", "Upon a release from prison, the Department shall reinstate or institute eligibility for and coverage under Medicaid to a person as soon as possible if the person otherwise meets eligibility requirements at that time.", "Section 2 of the bill requires the director of the Department of Corrections to complete the Medicaid application paperwork for an individual who is incarcerated as soon as practicable after the individual is authorized to enroll in Medicaid as outlined in section 1.", "As you can see, the bill's provisions aim to improve access to Medicaid for a person who has just been released from prison.", "Ideally, a person will have Medicaid coverage on the day of his or her release from prison without gaps in coverage.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 29, 2021 Currently, we have about 19,000 people incarcerated in our state prisons, and we need to find a way to ensure continuity of health care coverage and provide relevant social services for those who are incarcerated and transitioning back into our communities.", "Connecting these people to Medicaid early on can facilitate their integration back into the community by increasing their ability to address their health needs.", "This bill will contribute to greater stability in their lives and provide broader benefits to all our communities and help reduce recidivism within this population.", "I urge you to support this bill.", "Now, I would like to turn over my time to Director Whitley and his staff for additional remarks.", "Richard Whitley, Director, Department of Health and Human Services: Thank you for the opportunity to speak on behalf of this bill.", "The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) sees this as good policy.", "For evidence of why this legislation is needed, go to DHHS.NV.gov/analytics and scroll down to the corrections outreach dashboard [Exhibit C].", "For some time, we have been collecting information on inmates who are being discharged and matching it to identify if they have been enrolled in Medicaid.", "We do not do a good job; we definitely can do better.", "I think we do a good job in our detention facilities in Clark and Washoe Counties with getting inmates who are leaving enrolled, but we could do better in the Department of Corrections.", "So this legislation, with the combination of enrollment and suspension, will go a long way toward those improvements.", "Assemblywoman Nguyen also identified the benefits, and continuity of care is the big one.", "Many of these inmates with chronic health conditions, whether serious mental illness, HIV, or other conditions, are stabilized while they are incarcerated.", "To continue that care upon discharge could dramatically support their continuity of care.", "The other element is that the Department of Corrections, with General Fund money, currently pays for 30 days of discharge medication.", "We believe there would be a savings through enrollment in Medicaid upon exit.", "The day they leave, they would be enrolled in Medicaid and that pharmaceutical cost could be covered, drawing down a federal match for that, which would result in a savings for the state.", "So those are the two drivers.", "We currently have a contract out for our managed care.", "In the urban areas\u2014Clark and Washoe Counties\u2014Medicaid utilizes a managed care model.", "We have included in the request for proposal (RFP) for managed care a highlight of the criminal justice-involved population with scoring on strategies for transition to be included in the response.", "That RFP is currently out, and we are looking forward to innovations from the managed care companies to assist us with the transition from facility to community, and we will be scoring those applications based on the response.", "With me are Administrator Bierman and Deputy Administrator Thompson to answer any questions.", "Assemblywoman Nguyen: Do they have any presentations or are they here to answer any questions?", "Richard Whitley: They are just here to answer questions.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 29, 2021 Assemblywoman Nguyen: We are ready to answer questions.", "Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: Director Whitley said \"We\" when he spoke about the Medicaid costs in the first 30 days after release.", "Could we get clarity on who is paying for that?", "How is that being financed?", "Richard Whitley: \"We\" means the State of Nevada.", "The Department of Corrections currently provides 30 days of discharge medications to an inmate leaving.", "That is paid for with General Funds.", "If the inmate were enrolled in Medicaid, we would work with our managed care organizations to cover the cost and get the inmate an appointment prior to the 30 days of medication running out.", "Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: If we can enroll those who are going to be released before they are released, not only do we have an opportunity to have a federal match for Medicaid, which would save money, but we would also have an opportunity to get them an appointment with the person who will provide that continuing care so we can have a better opportunity for that person to remain stable.", "Am I understanding this correctly?", "Richard Whitley: Yes, both are the two key pieces: saving General Fund money and then the connection to an appointment prior to the medication running out.", "Assemblywoman Black: I do not see a fiscal note on the bill.", "I understand that there might not be one for the people who were on Medicaid who will now be suspended instead of removed, but what about new people coming on?", "How does that not cost any extra money?", "Richard Whitley: These individuals are all eligible for Medicaid, so they are entitled to application and enrollment.", "In the case of those leaving on medication, we believe they may be presenting a burden to our emergency rooms or having a crisis needing intervention, because that continuity of care is not currently as tight as it could be if they were enrolled in Medicaid.", "But their eligibility would already be covered, and they would mostly be newly eligible, which is the higher federal match.", "You are correct, there is no fiscal note on this, not only for the operation of the enrollment, nor for the actual delivery of services under Medicaid.", "There would not be an additional cost.", "The enrollments may go up, but people who are eligible for Medicaid can apply at any time, and we would not deny anyone who is eligible for Medicaid the enrollment.", "Assemblywoman Black: Is there any way to know roughly how many new people there might be?", "If we do not automatically enroll them, they may never enroll in Medicaid.", "I cannot believe that there is Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 29, 2021 not an added cost.", "I understand that they would be eligible, but apparently there is not an added cost.", "Is there some way to quantify that?", "Richard Whitley: As you can see on the dashboard I made reference to, we would continue that out to actually show the follow-up services inmates received.", "We could match that with the recidivism or reduction.", "But like any population, we review their application for eligibility.", "If they get a job and exceed the income, they would be terminated from Medicaid just like any other population.", "To your point, probably what would be interesting to look at is how many people leaving corrections end up in the emergency room, perhaps with uncompensated care, or with a more costly crisis because that continuity did not continue.", "We have not looked at that, but we certainly could.", "Vice Chair Peters: For reference, the link Director Whitley was talking about, that dashboard, is available on the Nevada Electronic Legislative Information System if you would like to check it out.", "Are there other questions?", "Assemblywoman Gorelow: I have a question regarding success with local jails.", "How has that been going for you?", "Richard Whitley: I can speak most comprehensively about the Clark County Detention Center and the Washoe County Detention Center.", "We have eligibility workers who go in.", "We have a good working relationship with the captains at each facility.", "The models are a little different in rural Nevada; it is relationship-based with sheriffs and whether they want us in their facility.", "The solutions in the jail are largely written applications.", "We continue to look at making it as easy as possible and certainly as less interruptive as possible.", "In the Clark County Detention Center, prior to COVID-19 we were averaging a few hundred applications a month.", "With COVID-19 and some of the restrictions on our staff being able to go in and assist with eligibility, those numbers have gone done.", "Captain Teel with Clark County Detention Center said that \"This is so good for our community\"; they have directly seen a reduction in recidivism and asked us to get this back up\u2014get our staff outfitted with PPE [personal protective equipment] so they could go back in.", "I would aspire to have our state Department of Corrections have outcomes like our large detention centers.", "Our welfare and eligibility workers do a fantastic job with getting folks enrolled.", "Vice Chair Peters: Is there quantifiable data related to the detention center in Clark County you were referencing that we could see?", "That may help answer some of Assemblywoman Black's questions about the results we are getting from lack of recidivism and the care provided through Medicaid offered to those inmates.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 29, 2021 Richard Whitley: Yes, we have Clark and Washoe detention centers data we can provide going back to 2019.", "Vice Chair Peters: As related to that, would you have the dollar amount of what is currently being spent on the purchase of medications as inmates are leaving the system\u2014those 30 days of medications they are getting?", "Richard Whitley: I do not.", "Within the Department of Corrections' budget, I do not know if they carve out their pharmaceutical costs that way.", "As we have this huge opportunity for improvement in the enrollment, it would be an important piece of data to capture\u2014not only for that 30-day medication issue, but did they get their appointment before the 30 days, and also that cost.", "I can follow up with the Department of Corrections and ask that question.", "Vice Chair Peters: Thank you.", "That would be helpful in understanding the kind of win this would be.", "I also have another clarification for you about the Medicaid match.", "What is the percentage of Medicaid match right now?", "Can you give us, dollar for dollar, on what the state puts in and how much is matched through the federal programs?", "Richard Whitley: I believe primarily this population would be newly eligible, so it would be a 90 percent federal match.", "Vice Chair Peters: So for every ten cents the state puts in, ninety cents from the federal government would be matched to that?", "Richard Whitley: Yes.", "Vice Chair Peters: Thank you for the clarification.", "Are there other questions from the Committee?", "Assemblyman Hafen: What is the state currently spending on medication for inmates?", "Richard Whitley: I do not have that information from the Department of Corrections.", "Currently, health care of inmates is in the Department of Corrections' budget, and that would include their discharge medications.", "I would be happy to reach out to them and get that information.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 29, 2021 Vice Chair Peters: Are there other questions from the Committee?", "[There were none.]", "I will move into testimony.", "Do you have anyone testifying in support, Assemblywoman Nguyen?", "Assemblywoman Nguyen: I do not believe there is anyone else.", "Director Whitley, was there anyone else testifying in support?", "Richard Whitley: No, I am speaking for our Department in support of the bill.", "Vice Chair Peters: We will take support testimony from the phone lines now for A.B.", "358.", "Nick Shepack, Program and Policy Associate, American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada: Formerly incarcerated individuals suffer disproportionately from health-related problems and can pose health risks to their family members and their communities.",

illnesses\u2014 some very severe.", "Health problems can also hinder a formerly incarcerated person's ability to secure employment.", "Access to health care is an essential yet often ignored aspect of successful reentry.", "Medicaid expansion under the ACA [Affordable Care Act] has offered an unprecedented opportunity for formally incarcerated people to gain access to health care.", "There are many barriers for formerly incarcerated people that make it difficult to enroll upon release.", "For one, they are dealing with other urgent issues such as housing or employment and may not have the time or bandwidth to seek health insurance post-release.", "The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, using data from the annual Medicaid budget, found 38 states are working with prisons and 32 are working with jails to help facilitate Medicaid enrollment prior to an inmate's release date.", "Additionally, in 37 states, Medicaid benefits are suspended rather than terminated upon being incarcerated in prison.", "Half of the states also report that they are working to enroll parolees in Medicaid.", "By ensuring that all eligible parties are enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid upon release from prison, we can reduce recidivism rates, reduce the community spread of communicable diseases, and provide one more tool for success for those being released from prison.", "We urge you to support this very important piece of legislation.", "Vice Chair Peters: Before we continue with support testimony, I want to restate that testimony is limited to two minutes per caller.", "You are always welcome to send in written testimony up to 48 hours after the Committee hearing.", "We will be taking 20 minutes of testimony in support.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 29, 2021 Jim Hoffman, Member, Legislative Committee, Nevada Attorneys for Criminal Justice: Nevada Attorneys for Criminal Justice (NACJ) supports A.B.", "358.", "Health care is an important part of preventing recidivism in formerly incarcerated people.", "In particular, a lot of theft and drug crime is driven by untreated mental health problems or drug abuse.", "By ensuring that people have access to mental health treatment and drug counseling immediately upon their release, we reduce the likelihood that they will reoffend.", "This is better for the people involved and better for the community as a whole.", "Therefore, NACJ supports A.B.", "358.", "Kendra G.

body last session passed A.B.", "236 of the 80th Session.", "The whole purpose of that bill was to enhance our criminal justice system and provide individuals with services to ensure that they do not enter into the criminal justice system in the first place.", "This bill will expand on that and help to ensure that those who are involved in the criminal justice system, when they are leaving jail or prison, have Medicaid so they are able to successfully reenter society and reduce recidivism.", "As of 2019, 43 other states have already implemented these suspension policies for those in prison and over 42 states have done the same for jails.", "Currently, in the Clark County Detention Center, it costs $190 per day for healthy inmates to be housed.", "In Washoe County, it is $130 up to $300 or $500, depending on the medication needs of the individual.", "Because of a lack of housing, sometimes our clients are stuck in custody waiting for bed space or waiting for other services because their Medicaid has been terminated.", "That is time in custody, and if we had the ability to provide them with resources more quickly, they would be able to reintegrate sooner, which would save us money in the long run, as well as reduce recidivism.", "Thank you again for this bill and for your time.", "Maria-Teresa Liebermann-Parraga, Deputy Director, Battle Born Progress: I want to say \"Ditto\" to

amendments I am exploring is whether there are other agencies better suited to conduct or organize the audits, such as the regional planning agencies or regional transportation commissions.", "Another aspect would be the incorporation of geographic information system, or GIS, mapping as a way to make data from the audits more broadly available.", "With that background, let me briefly go over the key provisions of the bill.", "Section 1 lays out the requirement for the district health departments to conduct walking audits of urbanized areas within their jurisdiction every three years.", "The state Division of Public and Behavioral Health would be tasked with conducting the audits in urbanized areas not covered by the two district health departments in Clark and Washoe Counties.", "The audits will be organized by census districts in urbanized areas to determine whether the physical environment contributes to the health of the community or detracts from it.", "Section 1 further provides that audit results will be submitted to the city council, county commission, and any planning commission or regional entity with jurisdiction over the area.", "In addition, the audit results would be posted on the health district's and Division's Internet Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 29, 2021 websites.", "Section 1, subsection 2 lays out the makeup of the audit groups and the goals of assessing land use, site design, and other factors contributing to public health, such as lighting, curb cuts, crosswalks, sidewalks, and benches.", "I have also included access to healthy food in the walking audits because too many inner-city residents have limited grocery and restaurant options.", "It is hard to eat well and be healthy when you are relegated to shopping at a convenience store or eating at a fast-food restaurant.", "Lastly, the audits would include suggestions on ways to enhance all these factors and thereby improve public health in the audited area.", "In closing, I urge your support of A.B.", "343 and the concept of walking audits to better understand our communities and their needs so we can work towards improving public health.",

what an urbanized area is.", "Is there a population threshold?", "Is there a density threshold?", "Assemblywoman Thomas: You are correct.", "There is a population threshold.", "As the bill indicates, with Clark County there is \"a population of 700,000 or more.\"", "In less populated areas it would be less than 700,000.", "Chair Nguyen: We have Ms. Karly O'Krent, our Legislative Counsel Bureau committee counsel, with us.", "She might be able to describe what that means in statute.", "Karly O'Krent, Committee Counsel: The provisions of this bill only apply in a county that is over 700,000 people.", "Currently, that is only Clark County, so an \"urbanized area\" would be Clark County.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 29, 2021 Assemblywoman Black: So the purpose of this is to collect the data and then the data is put on the health department's website.", "Say there is not a store where you can buy healthy food; we have simply identified that.", "We have not taken any steps to change it; we would just say that an area is lacking this or needs cuts into the sidewalks.", "It is just collecting data.", "I would like to understand what the intent is.", "Assemblywoman Thomas: Yes, the bill wants to clarify what those areas are lacking, and we want to present it to the county commissioners, as I stated in my address, and other entities so that we can afford this change.", "There is one thing we have to remember: urbanized areas are missing a lot of grant money from the federal government.", "When you change the way an area is and you can document it, you can apply for a grant; and with those grants, you can make changes.", "When we identify that certain areas are missing healthy food options, that is a big thing, and the reason why we can afford change is to, hopefully, get these grocery stores that can give us healthy food options to build.", "Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: This issue is very near and dear to my heart as I represent a community that is within the urbanized area of Las Vegas, Assembly District 6.", "The gathering of this information is very important for all the reasons she stated.", "Once a problem or situation is identified, then we have quantifiable data we can use as the basis for grants and to try and find funding to resolve some of these issues.", "Have you had an opportunity to meet with anyone from our local regional transportation commissions, either Washoe or the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada (RTC), to see what they have gathered, how they gather, and whether there is an opportunity for collaboration?", "Assemblywoman Thomas: We have been in contact with the transportation commission.", "This week we will be sitting down with all the stakeholders to clarify the language in the bill.", "We will get all concerned entities together so we can get this information.", "Right now, some of the things Washoe County and Clark County representatives\u2014Joanna Jacob and Joelle Gutman Dodson\u2014their concern is putting the weight on the health districts.", "I agreed that since we already have a way of assessing the audits through the RTCs, that perhaps we can get together with them and then the costs would not be burdensome on the health district because this is something they already do.", "We can quantify what A.B.", "343 is looking to do because they already have a way of auditing certain communities.", "Assemblywoman Gorelow: I have a question regarding section 1, subsection 1 and the three years that the audit needs to take place.", "How was the three-year time period determined versus two or four years?", "Assemblywoman Thomas: Looking at A.B.", "231 of the 73rd Session, we got the information from that bill.", "As I said, going back to the stakeholders meeting we will be having, we will decide whether it will be Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 29, 2021 three years or five years.", "That would be in conjunction with the transportation commission and/or RTC.", "When they walk to get their information, we want to make sure we are not putting due pressure on them to get another.", "We want it to be concisely done together, so I will be addressing that and I will get that answer for you.", "Assemblywoman Gorelow: I believe there are zones the federal government has already established, like Level 3 zones, which are economically disadvantaged zones.", "If you get SBA [Small Business Administration] loans in those areas, you can get some forgiveness, so this would really help that process.", "They would know what they could build in those areas and what the area actually needs.", "Am I putting those puzzle pieces together correctly?", "Assemblywoman Thomas: I have not discussed zoning or zones.", "I will bring that question up with the stakeholders this week.", "Assemblywoman Gorelow: Again, I may not be putting those puzzle pieces together correctly, but I remember some work I did in my other job.", "We were getting loan possibilities and they were talking about economically disadvantaged areas.", "I am thinking that this would work wonderfully, by determining what is needed in those areas, to encourage investors to build in those areas so they can get some benefits for that through the federal government.", "Assemblywoman Thomas: Thank you so much, and I will include that in our conversation.", "It sounds like a good idea.", "Assemblyman Hafen: We have the Nevada New Market Jobs Act which allows certain business entities to receive a credit in certain communities if they make these investments being talked about today.", "Have you talked to Clark County and their planning department to see if they are currently working on something similar?", "I know that in Nye County we looked at this, not as extensively as this bill proposes, but some of our recommendations came out to go into our master plan, to expand bike lanes and things of that nature.", "I did not know if there was any coordination with Clark County, and I was curious.", "Chair Nguyen: Assemblywoman Thomas, I see Ms. Jacob from Clark County on the line.", "Possibly she can answer Assemblyman Hafen's question after we have taken testimony in support, opposition, and neutral.", "At this time, we will begin testimony in support of A.B.", "343.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March

raising awareness on issues that add significant pressure to communities of lower incomes.", "Not everyone who lives in the county is the sole owner of a vehicle.", "Many times, a vehicle is shared between household members and not all folks can get where they need to when they need to.", "I live about a mile away from a supermarket.", "It is a 4-minute drive, but if I was to walk there, it is a 30-minute walk, and walking back is also an additional 30 minutes.", "One side of the street has a paved sidewalk, and the other side does not have a paved sidewalk.", "This street in general is very dark during the evening.", "Creating a process to help increase feasibility of pedestrian travel would be an important step in raising quality of life for non-vehicle-owner constituents.", "Although this may sound detached from the feasibility of being a pedestrian, the importance of reducing vehicle contamination from our communities and neighborhoods plays a crucial role in maintaining the health of Nevadans.", "In addition, the American Heart Association, in a 2019 ozone report, ranked Las Vegas as the thirteenth most ozone-contaminated city in the U.S.", "Contamination can lead to Nevadans becoming ill, it increases medical costs, and in worst-case scenarios, it takes lives away.", "I urge your support of this legislation to address the public health impacts of our neighborhood environments.", "Christi Cabrera, Policy and Advocacy Director, Nevada Conservation League: I would like to echo the comments of the previous speaker.", "Nevada is ranked the eleventh most dangerous state in the nation for pedestrians, and we must do more to make sure our streets are safe for everyone.", "We believe this bill will help our state better understand and address walkable neighborhoods and move toward creating safe environments for pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists, and transit riders.", "Walkable neighborhoods increase physical activities and promote healthier communities and can make our communities more safe, accessible, and enjoyable for everyone.", "Increasing walkability can also encourage people to leave their cars behind, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions and pollution.", "We would like to thank Assemblywoman Thomas for bringing this bill forward, and we urge the Committee's support.", "Chair Nguyen: Let us go to our next caller in support.",

County Health District: I want to thank the bill's sponsor for having an in-depth conversation with me, and I look forward to further conversations.", "While we are certainly in support of the concept and work in the areas Assemblywoman Thomas has addressed regarding environmental justice, nutrition deserts, air quality, and walkability to resources, unfortunately as written, we are in Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 29, 2021 opposition to the bill today because it is essentially an unfunded mandate for the health districts that we cannot afford right now.", "I have submitted a fiscal note, although I do not see it on NELIS [Nevada Electronic Legislative Information System].", "Right now, health districts in general might not be the appropriate placement for this bill and would require a professional skill set and technology database or system we do not have now.", "It would require hiring and purchasing that kind of equipment.", "There are several things happening in each of our communities north and south that may meet some of the Assemblywoman's needs for this bill, and I look forward to a conversation, possibly with the RTCs of northern and southern Nevada as well as with the Truckee Meadows Regional Planning Agency and the Southern Nevada Regional Planning Coalition.", "I think we can get to a solution, and I look forward to further conversations.", "Dora Uchel-Martinez, Private Citizen, Reno, Nevada: I apologize.", "I was calling in support but I had so much trouble with my phone.", "May I proceed or do you want me to call back?", "Chair Nguyen: I know everyone is having difficulty and I am flexible on this situation, so go ahead and testify in support and I will ask the Committee secretary to reclassify your testimony.", "Dora Uchel-Martinez: I am calling in support of A.B.", "343.", "I am totally blind and have a service dog.", "I live in north Reno in District 27.", "I utilize the sidewalks.", "Pretty

Nguyen: We will go back to testimony in opposition to the bill.", "[There was none.]", "We will go now to callers in neutral to the bill.", "Bradley Mayer, representing Southern Nevada Health District: Certainly the intent of this bill is good for public health.", "We are working with the Assemblywoman.", "We have been in contact with her and we are working on this bill together; but we at

assess this, especially a Complete Street policy, as we are rewriting our codes right now.", "We are engaged in looking at this in a comprehensive way.", "We have added bike lanes and sidewalks where feasible every time we update a street in Clark County.", "We always address ADA [Americans With Disabilities Act] compliance, so this has been something discussed at our board, so Assemblyman Hafen, yes, we are engaged in doing this work as well as in a comprehensive planning way that we do in unincorporated Clark County.", "We will continue to work with the Assemblywoman on this bill and take part in the stakeholder groups, Madam Chair, and assist where we can.", "Chair Nguyen: Do we have any other callers in neutral?", "[There were none.]", "At this time, I will turn this over to Assemblywoman Thomas for any closing remarks.", "Assemblywoman Thomas: As I stated earlier, we are working to solidify this bill to make it amenable to just about every agency that has a hand in affording the walkability for our residents.", "We know that this is something that is probably new to the state of Nevada because when I first moved here in 1982, they did not have sidewalks.", "So we are gradually moving into the twenty-first century and I look forward to meeting with the stakeholders this week.", "Chair Nguyen: With that, I will close the hearing on A.B.", "343 and open the

to improve care coordination and continuity of care for elderly Nevadans and individuals with disabilities following discharge from the hospital.", "Before I begin, I would just like to draw your attention to the amendment I submitted which should be on the Nevada Electronic Legislative Information System (NELIS) and which I will discuss in a minute [Exhibit F].", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 29, 2021 Being in the hospital is hard, and when a person is discharged, there are often aftercare instructions to follow, new medications to take, and follow-up appointments to attend.", "The post-discharge time can be hard for anyone, but it is especially hard on elderly individuals and those with disabilities\u2014and particularly for those who do not have a support system, or whose caregivers are not familiar with navigating the health care system.", "I recently experienced this firsthand when my mother was in the hospital.", "After her stroke, no one realized that this was the onset of dementia.", "Mom became very confused and frustrated whenever seeing her doctors and could not remember what she was advised to do.", "My brother, as her caregiver, would ask to go into the examination room so he was able to get the information and assist Mom with her meds and other doctor's orders.", "The goal of this bill is to authorize the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to create a program to improve care coordination and continuity of care for vulnerable Nevadans after they are discharged from the hospital.", "Specifically, section 1, subsection 1 of A.B.", "344 authorizes the Division of Aging and Disability Services (ADSD) within DHHS to establish a program through regulation to help older Nevadans and Nevadans with disabilities with the transition from the hospital to their home.", "Currently, the bill language refers to \"older persons\" and \"vulnerable persons.\"", "However, in working with ADSD on this bill, I am proposing an amendment to replace the term \"vulnerable person\" with \"person with a disability,\" which is language currently used in Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS).", "This amendment does not change the intent of the bill but ensures consistency in the use of existing terms.", "If ADSD creates this type of program, it must provide for cooperation between hospital staff who are responsible for discharging these individuals, as well as the individuals and their caregivers.", "It must also facilitate the coordination of health care and social services to support these individuals and their caregivers.", "Section 1, subsection 2 of the bill allows ADSD to limit the program to certain groups of older individuals or people with disabilities based on funding.", "It authorizes the Division to accept gifts, grants, and donations in order to establish and operate the program, and to use other available options to fund it, including billing third-party payers\u2014such as health insurance\u2014for services provided by the program.", "That brings me to another amendment I am proposing in section 1, subsection 2, paragraph (c), which follows \"Use other options available to fund the program, including, without limitation, billing third parties for the services provided by the program\" for current plan members.", "That is the additional verbiage\u2014\"for current plan members.\"", "Section 1, subsection 3 of the bill defines \"older person\" to mean an individual who is 60 years of age or older.", "It defines the term \"third party\" to include various health insurers, and it defines \"vulnerable person.\"", "However, as I mentioned, the proposed amendment would replace the definition of \"vulnerable person\" with the term \"person with a disability.\"",

available for this purpose.", "At this point, I would like to turn my time over to Jeffrey Klein, President and CEO of Nevada Senior Services.", "Mr. Klein's organization currently has a program that is doing this type of work, which has been extremely effective.", "We have submitted two documents that I believe he will discuss so that everyone has a better understanding of the type of program we envision through this bill.", "After his presentation, we would be happy to answer any questions, and I believe Cheyenne Pasquale, Social Services Chief, ADSD, DHHS, is available to answer any technical questions from the Division's side.", "Chair Nguyen: The amendments you were speaking about in your presentation were uploaded onto NELIS this morning.", "Jeffrey B.

deaths have increased 261 percent since 2000 [page 5].", "It is the sixth leading cause of death in Nevada and a major driver of hospital admissions and readmissions.", "We are faced nationally, but very much in Nevada, with the fact that while lifespan is much longer, health span is becoming more problematic because we live longer.", "We have people with multiple chronic conditions which ultimately lead them to be greater consumers of health care and more likely to be admitted to the hospital.", "Persons with dementia and the frail elderly typically will have care partners, family members, who are responsible for assisting them and maintaining themselves in the community [page 6].", "Those folks can be very stressed when family members have chronic diseases.", "We know that dementia in particular increases the burden on acute care systems.", "Any hospital executive will tell you that, and I was one for most of my career.", "It creates excessive resource consumption,

let them know how old you are and don't let them know if you are having problems thinking.\"", "There is a fear factor in seniors in particular, but also in other vulnerable populations, in having the hospital staffs even be aware the patient has this kind of fragile situation.", "Hospitalization rates for persons with dementia are more than twice what they are for the cognitively healthy.", "A third of hospitalized persons with Alzheimer's disease average one-and-a-half to two hospital stays a year [page 8].", "People with dementia comprise 40 percent of total hospital 30-day

difficulty even discharging them.", "Clark County, for instance, has one of the highest readmission rates in the country with over 35 percent of Medicare patients being readmitted to the hospital.", "They are more likely to not regain their health [page 9].", "For people with discharge issues associated with their ability to function in their homes, it makes them a more complicated discharge and more dangerous to discharge to the home without successful supports.", "They are more likely to get discharged to a nursing home, which we know is not the location of choice as we found out during the COVID-19 epidemic.", "They are also three to seven times more likely to be living in a nursing home three months after discharge, which represents both a human cost and an economic cost to the state of Nevada.", "Our Hospital 2 Home program started originally with a pilot program funded by the Aging and Disability Services Division as a subset of a federal Administration for Community Living program grant [page 10, Exhibit G].", "We piloted what we thought was an innovative approach to dealing with this population.", "We brought 25 dyads or 50 people through the program to test it, and it worked so well that we were invited by the federal Administration for Community Living to apply for a much larger three-year grant which just ended.", "Because of the grant, this population was focused heavily on the dementia population\u2014 persons with intellectual developmental disabilities who were at much higher risk for a dementia, the frail elderly who were hospitalized for any medical condition, live-alones, and, most recently, COVID-19-related admissions and discharges [page 11].", "Right now, we have a caseload of over 150 of those persons in Clark County who have either been directly or indirectly impacted by COVID-19 and have been discharged from hospital to home.", "We use a model originally developed by Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, adapted it for our environment, and developed a collaboration initially with the seven hospitals of Valley Health System [page 12].", "Now, it has spread to most of the hospitals in southern Nevada.", "Collaboration is really important, and one thing it brings, in addition to hospital collaborations for the clients, is post-discharge care transitions wraparound for all the services they need.", "Assembly Committee

we are inclined to sacrifice the wishes of the person trying to be discharged from the hospital or its complex in favor of what we think is going to keep them safe.", "That push and pull is really important in Hospital 2 Home.", "We start with the desires of the individual and we look to see how we can do that in a safe way.", "It includes both internal and external referrals for ongoing supports.", "We start with this 30-day program, we develop personalized care plans, we deal with behavioral and psychological symptoms, and the goal is to support these folks to not only make the transition, but to be able to engage access to supports which keep them safe in the community [page 15].", "We have added a fairly innovative feature to the program called \"respite coaching\" [page 16].", "Right now, we are evaluating what the best personnel would be to ultimately, long-term, deliver that service\u2014we are starting to think community health workers which has a special place in Nevada.", "The idea of the respite coach is to decrease post-hospitalization stress and caregiver burden because we know that caregiver burden is likely to cause readmission or long-term care placement.", "It provides a short-term, intensive respite but also allows us to provide training so the family caregiver can handle what is going on in the home and make connections for long-term supports [page 17, Exhibit G].", "These respite coaches, which are teams, are an intrinsic part of this whole idea of care transitions which is unique to Nevada and to our program.", "The service delivery also ties into referrals to community public and private resources [page 18].", "We have licensed social workers on the team.", "We provide case management and long-term services and supports, which is a natural for our aging and disability resource centers; basic needs programs; and caregiver education and support, which is really important.", "How do we educate family caregivers

homes\u2014not having them bounce in and out of the hospital.", "There were 6 out of the 363 who ultimately were readmitted for a different diagnosis; for example, someone had a stroke and then three months later fell and broke a hip\u2014that was a different admission.", "A couple of interesting things came out of some of our studies that I think will help you understand the pragmatics of the program and how important they are.", "If you take a look at what we call \"first tier\" discharge challenges, insufficient support at home is 66 percent of Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 29, 2021 the cases [page 21], so we know that this is a critical factor.", "Concerning referrals for caregiver support [page 22], 76 percent of the people discharged required caregiver support, 75 percent required respite care, and then home modifications were 36 percent.", "These are critical for wrapping this into the whole idea of a successful discharge.", "Basically, what is happening with this program now is it is more ubiquitous.", "We started with dementia and then moved on to broader cognitive impairments, then COVID-19, and now the broad arena of people who are complex\u2014have family caregivers or have an array of problems which make them difficult to be discharged.", "We know that it clears beds in the hospitals faster.", "We know it eliminates unsafe discharges to homes.", "We know it predicts outcomes.", "We know it keeps people out of long-term care and therefore reduces their risk for things like COVID-19 or pneumonias or even the flu.", "It has been a highly successful program.", "We are very supportive of the state of Nevada having a broad-based program to assist hospitals, to have this resource available and most importantly, to assist our seniors and those persons who are at highest risk to be able to get back to home and stay there\u2014without readmissions, without possible utilization of services, and without the need for long-term care placement.", "My thanks to Assemblywoman Thomas for taking on this very tough issue and one that has a big impact on an aging and fragile population.", "Assemblywoman Thomas: We are open to answer questions.", "Chair Nguyen: Assemblywoman Titus, go ahead with your question when you are ready.", "Assemblywoman Titus: As a provider, having been administrator and director of a long-term care unit and working in emergency rooms discharging patients, there is already a mandatory requirement for safe discharges.", "We have discharge planners, patient advocates, and communications.", "We have to have that \"warm handoff,\" that safe discharge.", "Does this bill change any of that?", "That is my first question.", "My second question is, are we now limiting this to just persons with disabilities?", "Do we now not have to have that safe discharge for all the other patients I discharge?", "And finally, I would like some more details on some of the studies you did.", "It sounds as though you are already doing this.", "What will this law change that you are not already doing?", "Jeffrey Klein: One of the issues about this kind of Hospital 2 Home program is that it focuses on the most complex cases that traditional discharge planning does not get to.", "The example I always give is a 45-year-old who had gallbladder surgery and the discharge planner comes through the door and says, \"When can your person pick you up?", "You are going home today, and make sure you take your medications and get back to your doctor.\"", "If the hospital has a good care transitions initiative, they follow up to make sure you filled your prescription and you booked your doctor's appointment.", "To a family caregiver who is so totally fried that they are basically immobile because they have been taking care of a loved one for a long period of Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 29, 2021 time who has now ended up in the hospital, that person needs way more help and supports; that person has issues.", "To give you an example, very often they do not have a working refrigerator when they go home, there is no food in there and no way to fill the medications.", "What Hospital 2 Home tries to do is decompress that family caregiver and get life back under control.", "In the first couple of days in particular, we try to take away a lot of those really pressing issues that have so immobilized those family caregivers so they can clear the air, deal with them, and then have a support system.", "That is fairly unique, and not necessarily a program everyone needs.", "We think for our highly complex, more fragile family caregiving situations\u2014whether in the elderly population or in the adults-with-disabilities population\u2014they find it very valuable.", "Not only is it humane, but it is financially beneficial.", "Assemblywoman Titus: Just to be clear, you are already doing this.", "You have this program.", "Do we need legislation to enact a program you are already doing?", "Jeffrey Klein: It is not available to everybody.", "It was done originally through a federal grant which is now over.", "We have it available on a limited basis through some minor funding we have available through ADSD\u2014Older Americans Act\u2014or COVID-19 money which will expire on September 30 of this year\u2014or through a limited number of insurers that are willing to pay for portions of the service.", "It is not yet covered by Medicare as we know it, nor is it yet covered by Medicaid as we know it.", "It only exists to the extent that we are able to provide funding and do it for free for people.", "Assemblywoman Titus: Nowhere in this legislation does it mandate that Medicaid or Medicare pays for it, but does it enable you to accept grants to expand the program?", "Jeffrey Klein: The ADSD would be able to accept those grants and then contract with us or others to help deliver the program.", "More importantly, I hope it sets a platform for Medicaid to cover the services where it will be cost-beneficial.", "Also, it encourages the hospitals to urge their managed care partners to participate in it.", "Right now, we have several managed care organizations that are looking at it, but certainly, encouragement from the State of Nevada would help.", "Assemblywoman Titus: That brings me back to your statement about readmissions.", "You testified that no one was readmitted for the original diagnosis.", "What was the length of time?", "Was it within 30 days that no one was readmitted for their original diagnosis?", "Was the diagnosis limited to mental dementia?", "What was the diagnosis no one was readmitted for, and over what period of time?", "Jeffrey Klein: The study had 363 people in it over a 3-year period of time\u2014really it was over 2.5 years because the first 6 months was a planning cycle.", "It included a wide range of diagnoses from Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services March 29, 2021 surgeries to heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the late effects of diabetes\u2014so there was a wide range.", "The initial work was limited to persons with a

IDEA [Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 2004].", "It only makes sense that Nevada ensures our language in statute follows suit.", "The purpose behind person-first language emphasizes the individuality, equality, and dignity of people with disabilities by maintaining that an individual is a person first and foremost, and that traits and medical conditions do not define who he or she is but are rather simply that\u2014a trait or medical condition.", "Using person-first language reduces social stigmas and provides a frame of reference that places all people in the same category before introducing any other aspects to be considered.", "Although not every person agrees with person-first language, it generally invokes mutual respect and is appreciated by most of the disability community.", "As the chair of the Nevada Statewide Independent Living Council, I am speaking on behalf of the Council when I say that Nevada still chooses to educate and inform any and all who may question the purpose or meaning behind this movement and supports person-first and respectful language options for people with disabilities.", "The most important thing to remember when considering person-first language is that it replaces antiquated and offensive terminology that has no business in Nevada language.", "Words do matter.", "In my experience, I can testify that for years I felt like a farm animal being herded by doctors, psychiatrists, and institutions while they used my diagnoses as labels to push me through to the next provider.", "I do not think these professionals started to see me as a person until the paradigm began to change.", "Suddenly, I became a person with autism, a person with hearing loss, a person with blindness, a person with a neurological disorder.", "My life changed dramatically when professionals began to address me about my diagnoses and not talk to each other about my diagnoses as if I did not even exist.", "It may not seem like it matters to people who have never had to remind others they are in the room, but I can tell you that it has made an enormous impact on the quality of my life.", "I am a person with disabilities, and I

"Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 2, 2021 The question is, Why are our costs so high?", "There have been various theories over the years, most emphasizing the volume of care and unnecessary care.", "Any comparison to other countries makes it clear that the U.S. pays more because our prices are higher; and prices are higher, in part, because our insurance system generates much higher administrative costs that are incorporated into physician and hospital costs.", "And, in part, the cost of insurance premiums is related to the same administrative costs.", "The problem is not only that prices are high, but they are extremely varied.", "This means insurers and medical care providers have extra costs; first, in keeping track of all the different prices in all the different contracts, and second, in negotiating all the different prices in all the different contracts.", "As an example, I was once giving a talk in Paris about the American health care system.", "I said that the Cleveland Clinic had 1,600 doctors.", "Everyone went, \"Ooh, aah.\"", "Then I said it had 2,000 billing clerks.", "People looked at me in bewilderment.", "Why would you need 2,000 billing clerks?", "That is the kind of variation that has been going on.", "There are various estimates of the excess costs associated with our billing and payment system.", "They have to be at least 5 percent of total spending and probably much more.", "In my written testimony [Exhibit H], I provide links to various sources on all this.", "The variation in prices is also a severe problem.", "The U.S. system for establishing prices involves wide variation in what each hospital charges to different payers\u2014either insurers or individuals\u2014for the same services, such as a colonoscopy; huge differences in what different providers charge to the same payer; and the surprise medical billing in which we can go to a hospital that is in-network and get a huge out-of-network bill from an anesthesiologist or emergency room physician or other provider who does not work for the hospital.", "It is important to emphasize that if prices are standardized in the way A.B.", "347 would create, surprise bills would disappear.", "Moreover, so would the incentives to create narrow networks.", "The main reason for narrow networks is as a bargaining technique for insurers: they seek lower prices from providers by threatening to exclude physicians or hospitals from the \"covered lives\" insurers provide for them.", "The much higher prices in the United States show that this \"selective contracting\" does not work very well; but it creates confusion and difficulty for patients who just want to go to the doctor or hospital and get help without huge expense.", "It is hard to overstate the irritations and hassles associated with the narrow networks and the uncertainty about what is covered and what is not; whose care is covered and whose care is not.", "Assembly Bill 347 would create a version of what is called an \"all-payer\u201d system.", "In an all-payer system there are multiple insurers, but all or most pay each provider by the same rules.", "This simplifies billing and payment.", "It accomplishes most of the savings that could be associated with a single-payer system, or so-called \"Medicare for all.\"", "There are versions of all-payer systems in many countries, such as Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Switzerland.", "It is also how Medicare Advantage works.", "Private Medicare Advantage insurers pay hospitals' Medicare prices.", "This was not something this bill tried to do, but it did it by accident because the law requires that providers outside a Medicare Advantage plan's network charge the standard Medicare fees for out-of-network care, to protect Medicare beneficiaries in case they have to go out of network.", "Because the out-of-network Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 2, 2021 plans have to accept Medicare fees, there is no reason for an insurer to contract with an in-network plan and pay more than Medicare fees, so they basically pay the Medicare fees.", "As Assemblyman Orentlicher showed, there is a lot of market competition between insurers in Medicare Advantage.", "Basically, A.B.", "347 proposes that Nevada set prices with independent insurers in a way that already applies to over 60 million Medicare beneficiaries, 24 million of whom are in Medicare Advantage plans.", "It takes the simplest approach to setting rates: start with Medicare's rules and then deviate if the physician group or hospital can make a reasonable case.", "For example, as in Medicare and its indirect medical education expenses and its disproportionate share of hospital payments, there may be arguments that a hospital has extra costs from teaching or from a disproportionate share of uninsured patients.", "If the Medicare extra payment is not enough, that may justify higher fees.", "Providers will argue that Medicare payments are inherently inadequate.", "That is probably because they make their costs fit whatever money they can get.", "They have a great deal of market power to get money for all sorts of things, some of which many of us would not think are useful, like some of the salaries for administrators.", "One should be skeptical about the claims for Medicare payments being inadequate for a few reasons.", "The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission analyzes payment adequacy carefully.", "You can look at the methodology in Chapter 2 of their annual reports on Medicare Payment Policy.", "The most recent report came out a few weeks ago.", "The proposed payment reform should substantially reduce hospitals' and medical groups' costs, through the savings from simplification of billing.", "The proposed payment reform would increase income through raising Medicaid fees to the Medicare levels.", "While some would come from the provider tax, more would be from a new federal subsidy due to the Medicaid matching percentage.", "Even if right now the Medicare payments are lower than they should be, which the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission would deny, it remains the case that there will be substantial savings to providers and new income to providers from this bill.", "The Medicare payments would have to be off by some meaningful amount for them to be actually inadequate.", "Nobody should imagine that any reform will work perfectly, but the approach used for A.B.", "347 is straightforward and relatively simple.", "We should remember that versions of all-payer rate-setting have been implemented successfully around the world.", "Most other proposals for controlling health care costs involve far less positive experience and evidence.", "I could direct you to what was in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and what the health care policy wants being proposed over the years.", "None of them has a track record comparable to the record of administrative simplification and rate-setting simplification we see in other countries with all-payer rate-setting.", "Thank you for your consideration, and I am happy to try to answer any questions.", "Chair Nguyen: Assemblyman Orentlicher, are others here to be part of your presentation, or are they here for supportive testimony?", "Assemblyman Orentlicher: Jolette Goins, KC Christon, and Asia Duncan are here as part of the presentation.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 2, 2021 Jolette Goins, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: I would like to share a testimony of the strain our health care policies are for me personally.", "My interest in the bill is because of the hope that some of these things can be eradicated.", "I am a senior and have a modest income.", "I work three days a week and I get social security, but I have health care from my job.", "I pay what I think is a crazy amount of money for it, but we must have health care.", "After age 65, you are required to have Medicare, so I am covered by two insurances.", "I thought this would be good.", "I thought I would be able to take care of myself and be healthy.", "I went to the doctor and got a diagnosis.", "They gave me a plan for recovery, but I cannot afford to do the care because the deductibles are so outrageous.", "When you are choosing your insurance, they do not necessarily list all the deductibles.", "You know you are going to pay for office visits; you know you are sometimes going to pay for diagnostic testing and things.", "That is okay, but when you go and get a diagnosis and they tell you this is what it is going to take to get you in a better place and then you find out that you have to pay this deductible before you can get the work done.", "This has happened to me more than once.", "It is very frustrating when you feel like you have taken the right steps, you have taken the right precautions, but at the end of the day you still cannot do the things necessary to have the ultimate for yourself health-wise.", "Chair Nguyen: Are you finished with your testimony?", "Jolette Goins: I believe so.", "Asia Duncan, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: I am a small business owner.", "Today I come before you because it is difficult to pay for health insurance, not just for myself as an individual, but even small group health care plan options for my team are expensive and unsustainable for my business at this time.", "Health care accessibility and affordable health care coverage, in my opinion, are essential to individual's and families' overall health and wellness.", "I care about the individuals who work for me, and I care about their families.", "I would love to be able to make health care options available to them, but I do not want to affect my business's ability to profit.", "The average annual premium for small group health plans are roughly $3,500 to $5,000.", "On top of several other necessary and mandatory insurance coverages that I am required to have, it was not a feasible option to add health care.", "Individually, my premium is around $4,000 a year.", "I went to the marketplace and shopped around to find the best policy and coverage for my family and me, but I am still paying $4,000 a year.", "Health insurance for me is just one of those \"in the event of an emergency\" situations because I practice a healthy lifestyle and healthy living.", "Some people who work for me have preexisting conditions and other life-altering illnesses.", "When I talk to them about health care, they often tell me that if I pay them too much, they will not qualify for Medicaid.", "I do not understand how Medicaid relates to pay raises.", "I always thought it was a good thing to get pay raises, but some of them do not want them because they want to maintain their Medicaid.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 2, 2021 I hope my testimony today will allow legislators to consider lowering the cost of health care overall for small groups and small health care plans and for individuals and people like me.", "Chair Nguyen: Is there another testifier?", "KC Christon, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: I would like to talk about the families that I serve.", "I work for Acelero Learning, a Head Start program.", "We serve children six weeks of age to pre-kindergarten.", "We deal with a lot of families from diverse backgrounds.", "The pattern I am seeing is the challenge for these parents to have and obtain health care.", "When they do have health care, the system is quite challenging to navigate.", "If a simplified way of providing health care is available, that would be beneficial to members of the community.", "There is a lot of reading and the terminology\u2014folks are having a challenging time understanding what it means and interpreting what it means and what happens if they do this or do not do this.", "They come to me.", "I am their first stop.", "I work with their children at the school, so I get a lot of questions and find myself doing a lot of research just to answer basic questions for the parents.", "I can understand their frustration because there was some time that I did not have health insurance myself.", "Being able to navigate the Medicaid/Medicare system in Nevada is challenging.", "I can only imagine what these parents are going through on a daily, weekly, monthly basis with multiple children, some who have moderate health problems, some who have severe health problems.", "That is one of the things I would like to present to you today.", "If that could be considered, I am sure that would be greatly appreciated.", "Chair Nguyen: Assemblyman Orentlicher, are there any remarks before we open for questions?", "Assemblyman Orentlicher: We can go to questions.", "Chair Nguyen: Members of the Committee, please send your questions to me.", "I will direct the questions to Assemblyman Orentlicher first, so we do not do a round robin where everyone has an answer for the question.", "He can direct questions to the most appropriate person.", "Assemblyman Hafen: I appreciate the number of stakeholder meetings you had.", "I participated in the working group with you.", "I know it has been difficult working virtually on such a complex bill, but I think your passion to try to bring health care to all parts of our state is something we all agree upon.", "I know there are a lot of moving parts in the building with a few other bills.", "I know you cosponsored other bills to help address some of the health care issues in bringing medical professionals to the state.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 2, 2021 Has there been any consideration of what is going to happen with the doctor shortage we currently have in relation to how this bill would be implemented?", "Would we see an increase or a decrease?", "Would this be seen as an attractive measure to bring additional medical professionals to the state?", "Assemblyman Orentlicher: I think this will do a lot to make Nevada more attractive.", "The low payment on the Medicaid side is a perennial and serious irritant to physicians and other providers.", "We do not pay them adequately, and they lose money.", "Being able to tell them we pay at Medicare rates for Medicaid would be a huge benefit and would make this state more attractive.", "They would not have to deal with multiple insurers, not have to negotiate.", "The number of billing clerks and other administrative staff that increases the cost of running a medical practice, that number would decrease, and they would be able to bring primary care reimbursement up.", "Right now, if you are a pediatrician, an internist, or family doctor, it is hard to make a go of it on your own.", "You end up seeing more and more doctors becoming employed by hospitals or private equity firms.", "It is much better for them if they can maintain their independent practices, and it is better for their patients.", "I think there are a lot of benefits.", "Having a freeze on the noneconomic damages cap\u2014doctors will love that when they are thinking about where to practice.", "I think this will address the doctor shortage.", "Chair Nguyen: Do you have any follow-up questions, Assemblyman Hafen?", "Assemblyman Hafen: I have additional questions, but I will let other members ask their questions and come back.", "Assemblyman Matthews: I want to echo what Assemblyman Hafen said about your efforts in working on this bill.", "You reached out to me, and I appreciated the opportunity to get together with you to talk about it.", "You covered a lot of ground and touched on some of this peripherally, but I hope we can zero in a bit more.", "You talked about rates and rate-setting.", "Who would set these rates?", "How do we ensure that a commission will be educated and informed enough to intelligently evaluate and consider all the relevant market variables and not be conflicted by outside influences in that process?", "Assemblyman Orentlicher: The commission would have a board with a wide range of stakeholders to make sure all voices are represented and that insurers, providers, employers, workers, and patients are all there to make sure their views are taken into account.", "It will also have a staff of expert analysts who can look at the data and figure out, as Medicare does now, what are fair costs and what is a fair profit.", "We have seen, and as Professor White indicated, every other country has been able to do this.", "We do it with public utilities using a similar model.", "We do have to properly staff it\u2014both the people who do the data-crunching and the people who are on the board.", "There are good models out there, and I am interested in feedback in how to design it as well as possible.", "Professor White might want to add comments.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 2, 2021 Joseph White: One thing is an issue of how you think about what outside influences are.", "The important outside influences are the people who are asking for more money, and they are going to try to use influence to get more money.", "I am not sure there are other outside influences that will play on these kinds of things.", "If you look at the questions of underlying costs, a lot of this stuff like geographic variations and rent and labor costs are already in the Medicare formulas for hospitals.", "Once administrative costs go down for providers, Medicare rates will be closer, or more certainly adequate.", "You need an appeals process and a way for providers to make a claim that they are different for some reason.", "It would probably work the way the appeals process for other bodies works.", "We cannot be sure it will be perfect, but I think it should be pretty good.", "I also think we can be absolutely sure the providers with the market power to achieve or extort higher prices will say it is unfair.", "We know that will happen.", "Assemblyman Matthews: You referenced experts.", "An expert in one field is not necessarily an expert in another.", "What do you have in mind?", "Are you talking about a combination of health care professionals, providers, economists, and academics?", "Experts will not necessarily agree.", "Based on areas of expertise, they may end up in conflict.", "How do you see that playing out?", "What fields would these experts be drawn from?", "Joseph White: Personally, I would like accountants.", "Some will claim their costs are higher for some reason.", "I would like to see people who can assess the data used to make those claims.", "I think there is an argument for having a variety of skills on these panels.", "Assemblyman Orentlicher has thought more about that than I have.", "You want a variety of skills and perspectives, but I think one substantial part of it is accounting.", "Somebody is making a claim about costs.", "Are they telling you the truth?", "Do they not understand their own costs?", "Are the costs actually higher than they are saying?", "I think that is probably the most fundamental skill set here.", "Assemblyman Matthews: Would a cost-based rate system incentivize increased costs if it is structured that way?", "How are we defining \"costs\"?", "Who would be defining what those costs are under this bill?", "Assemblyman Orentlicher: That is one of the risks\u2014that people will try to inflate costs.", "That is one of the advantages of starting with Medicare, because Medicare does a lot of vetting already, of reasonable costs and unreasonable costs.", "That is when we would have the expert staff\u2014the accountants, economists, and health policy people\u2014put the burden on the providers to show that this is a reasonable cost.", "It is not to cover all costs; it is to cover reasonable costs.", "They will have to justify and prove the cost that Medicare does not cover actually is a reasonable cost.", "The other thing that is part of the rate-setting is rewarding efficiency.", "Some providers and some hospitals are more efficient than others.", "The rate-setting commission will take that into account because they will not look at just one provider, they will be looking at the full range Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 2, 2021 of providers to get a good sense of which are efficient and which are inefficient.", "That is something they will consider.", "The important thing is that Medicare is already doing this and has been doing it for a long time, so we know it can be done in an effective way.", "Chair Nguyen: I have a question for you, Assemblyman Orentlicher.", "In the amendment, you have a cap on noneconomic medical malpractice damages if the provider group participates in the provider tax.", "Will you give me the reasoning behind that?", "In your presentation, you indicated medical malpractice claims account for less than 1 percent of the cost.", "Was this the result of conversations with stakeholders?", "How did that amendment come about?", "Assemblyman Orentlicher: Change can be scary to people, even if it is the right thing to do.", "When you propose significant change, people get nervous.", "To provide reassurance that we are trying to do the right thing and to make this a more appealing opportunity for providers who are trying to decide whether to vote for the provider tax, we added the protection on medical malpractice, which causes anxiety for them.", "Anything we can do to provide reassurance that this is the right thing to do for them and that they and their patients will be better off, is helpful.", "Chair Nguyen: Where did you get the data that said medical malpractice claims only represent a small percentage of health care costs?", "Is that in our state?", "Is that nationally?", "Where did the 1 percent number come from?", "Assemblyman Orentlicher: That number is widely accepted national data.", "I will try to find a particular source, but that is the standard view of the total cost of the tort system.", "People may ask about defensive medicine.", "It does not include defensive medicine; that is harder to pin down.", "You can measure how much is spent on liability insurance and court cases.", "That 1 percent is a pretty good number.", "Defensive medicine is in the minds of doctors, so some estimates may go to 3, 4, or 5 percent.", "Even if it does not cost you dollars to go to court, there is a psychological cost to having to defend yourself in a lawsuit.", "That does not show up in the 1 percent of economic costs.", "Chair Nguyen: There are more questions from members.", "Assemblywoman Peters: The work you put into this bill is impressive.", "I have been invited to many of the meetings and was able to sit in on a little of it.", "I have questions about the data collection you referenced.", "The data would be used to determine payment amounts.", "What data is currently being collected?", "How would we have to modify the collection practice?", "Where would the data collection be hosted?", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 2, 2021 Assemblyman Orentlicher: One of the advantages of structuring it the way the bill does is they start with Medicare, and hospitals are already filing Medicare costs reports.", "Medicare has already accumulated a lot of data.", "The second part is that if providers think Medicare is not adequate, they can come before the commission.", "They can ask to raise the rate by 5 percent, or 10 percent, or whatever they think is right.", "They may say it needs to be raised by 40 percent.", "Then they have the obligation to provide evidence and the data to support their claim.", "The data will come to the commission through the petition process because you cannot demonstrate you need an increase in rates unless you show us your cost data, so it will inevitably follow from the process.", "Assemblywoman Peters: I am a data nerd and love technology, databases, and data management.", "I am having this fantasy of a process in which we could use artificial intelligence to run an algorithm on data input by these entities and leave the experts and people out of it after we oriented a process that was amicable\u2014a little science fiction for the Committee.", "My other question has to do with some of the data you presented related to the difference in cost between medical procedures in the United States versus other countries.", "Did those studies account for the difference in the cost of living expenses in the United States?", "Living costs here are different than they are in Taiwan.", "Would you explain how that is normalized?", "Assemblyman Orentlicher: After I finish, Professor White can provide more information.", "I do not know about the cost of living in Taiwan.", "I was planning to use Japan, but I had trouble getting the numbers from Japan.", "Japan has a much higher cost of living, and their prices would not look that different from Taiwan's.", "The cost of living does not explain the differences.", "The major difference is governments negotiate.", "You have a single negotiator on the purchaser side, the government.", "That is just how government negotiation works.", "The government negotiating has more leverage than insurers.", "We think of insurers as being big, bad, and powerful; but compared to a government, they do not have the same kind of negotiating leverage.", "In a lot of communities, hospitals do.", "If you are the only hospital in the community, or the Cleveland Clinic, or the University of Texas MD Anderson Center, or a must-have hospital patients want to have in their network, then they have a lot of negotiating leverage.", "When the government is negotiating on behalf of all patients, you get a different result.", "That is why you see the lower prices.", "Japan has a much higher cost of living than we do, and their prices look a lot like Taiwan's.", "Joseph White: There are even situations where the government does not set the prices.", "In Germany, the insurers get together.", "The system is set up so they get together and negotiate, but it has the same effect.", "What you are doing is concentrating the market power among the insurers.", "That is a way that does not exist in the United States.", "Although people complain about them, the striking thing about American insurers is they are wimps.", "They are bad at negotiating prices, partly because they have a choice.", "They are middlemen.", "On one side, they are negotiating with individual employers who are small compared to them; on the other side, Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 2, 2021 they are negotiating largely with concentrated hospital networks.", "In many communities, there are three cardiac care groups.", "They must make a choice.", "Do they negotiate harder with the people with whom they have less market power, the providers, or with their customers?", "The answer is it is easier for them to pass the providers' demands on to their customers.", "What their market power means is that there are not that many insurers, so there are not many places for the customers to go.", "Our insurers are weak.", "On the question of comparing costs, you cannot simply use exchange rates to turn the Japanese yen into dollars at the common exchange rate and make the comparison.", "That is somewhat indicative, but the fact is that there is only so much it gets you.", "There are a lot of analyses that have gone into greater depth.", "One thing is to show the big difference in percentage of GDP [gross domestic product] because gross domestic product includes everything in the economy, so if we are at 18 percent and somebody else is at 11 or 12 percent, then we really must be doing something more expensive.", "If you look at what we are doing, it is prices, not volume.", "Some of that is for drugs.", "This does not really address drugs, which is a different problem, but a major one.", "The other side of it is there have been people who tried to control for local costs of living.", "Back in 2007 and 2008, McKinsey [the McKinsey Global Institute] did a detailed study.", "Their adaptation and estimates were based on controlling for underlying cost of living differences to at least some extent.", "They still found the same basic story, which is that the difference in cost between the United States and other countries is due to prices and administrative costs.", "It is important to understand what spending less would mean.", "On the one hand, probably on average\u2014not in every country, for instance, not necessarily for nonhospital doctors in Japan\u2014American doctors are paid more.", "Doctors will have significantly lower costs because they will not be paying all these administrative staff.", "That means you can pay them lower fees, but they will end up ahead or at least equal.", "If we are saying there is a lot of unnecessary billing work, then I admit we are saying there are some jobs that will have to go away\u2014because if you have those 2,000 billing clerks at the Cleveland Clinic and you simplify, there are job losses.", "When you are doing your calculation of whether a hospital needs more money, if the CEO is making $3 million, then maybe you do not want to accommodate that in the claim for more money.", "So there are potential losers.", "On the other hand, the winners will potentially be everybody else.", "What we are talking about is a situation in which even people with good insurance are losing it.", "The big beneficiaries of the non-Medicaid part of this plan\u2014Medicaid is improved by paying higher rates so people with Medicaid can get better services\u2014are the people who have insurance through their employers.", "As costs go down, insurance will be much more affordable for employers; the employers will have less need to cut benefits the way they have been doing that.", "Currently, the increase in costs in the system has its biggest effect on people who are getting insurance through their employers.", "Most of the people who are getting it through Medicare\u2014well, Medicare's prices are regulated.", "For people who are getting it through Medicaid, it is a different problem.", "The people getting it through the marketplaces, Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 2, 2021 their premiums\u2014if you are under 400 percent of the federal poverty level\u2014are limited already.", "The big winners from controlling health care costs more effectively in the system are employers, including the State of Nevada.", "Assemblywoman Peters: Thank you for breaking that down a little more.", "Calling someone a loser for reducing his or her annual pay from $2 million to something less does not seem like that big a loss to me compared to someone not having to be buried for the rest of their life for a hospital bill because their child fell off a bike.", "The costs and benefits balance must have some perspective.", "Thank you for those responses.", "Assemblywoman Krasner: If somebody breaks an arm and needs to go to an orthopedic surgeon, would the orthopedic surgeon who is skilled and has been doing surgeries on broken arms for 20 years be paid the same as an orthopedic surgeon who has been doing surgeries for 6 months?", "Assemblyman Orentlicher: Will we have different rates for different providers?", "Potentially.", "The bill includes a provision to say quality of care should be taken into account.", "I think that is a good idea.", "That said, quality-based payments do not have a very good track record.", "It is a good concept in theory, but in practice we have found it has been difficult to adjust reimbursements based on quality of care, although it has been tried for a long time.", "The evidence is not good for its effectiveness, but the bill includes it.", "If a provider could demonstrate that he or she is providing a higher quality of care, that should be rewarded.", "Professor White said we may lose some positions for billing clerks.", "Other employers who have lower health care costs will be able to hire more workers.", "I think that overall, we are likely to get more people working when you lower health care costs.", "If you lower the cost of operating the business, you can expand your business more quickly and hire more workers.", "Assemblywoman Krasner: Would there be a way for a provider, a doctor, or a hospital to appeal the rate that was found to be applicable?", "Assemblyman Orentlicher: Yes, they could come in and say, We think we should have a higher rate.", "They would get a response from the commission, and there would be an appeals process within the commission as there is within Medicare.", "They could challenge and ask the commission to reconsider its response.", "Chair Nguyen: Do you have any further questions, Assemblywoman Krasner?", "Assemblywoman Krasner: No.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 2, 2021 Assemblywoman Titus: Thank you, Assemblyman Orentlicher, for the presentation and the time and effort that you have put into this bill.", "This nationwide discussion has been going on for decades, and to solve the nationwide problem in a couple hours' testimony is a heavy lift for anybody.", "I believe these are conversations well worth having.", "I would like to go to the bill itself and ask some questions pertaining to the bill, as opposed to the concept of health care and its issues in our nation and worldwide.", "The amendment you added plays along with some of what Chair Nguyen asked regarding section 6 of the conceptual amendment about the provider groups.", "If they choose to join the provider tax, will there be a cap on the economic [noneconomic] damages?", "I am curious about that chapter in Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS).", "What will happen to providers who do not sign on?", "Will they face unlimited exposure?", "Would you clarify that for me?", "Assemblyman Orentlicher: The way the provider tax has to work under Medicaid rules is if you apply it to a class of providers\u2014hospitals are a class, physicians are a class, dentists are a class\u2014you could subdivide physicians and say, We only want pediatricians to come in or emergency doctors to come in.", "There are paths to do that, but it is very difficult to do it that way.", "Let us assume all doctors come in as a class.", "That happens only if two-thirds of doctors in the state vote to assume the tax.", "Then, Medicaid requires that everybody be in.", "If you voted against it\u2014if you were one of the 30 percent who voted against it\u2014you would still pay the tax.", "Assemblywoman Titus: What about this economic [noneconomic] damage in your amendment in section 6, subsection 5?", "It talks about the noneconomic damages shall not be raised and applied to a provider.", "Is it on all providers in the group?", "What about those who have not joined in a group, like me?", "I was in private practice at one point in my career.", "Would those be protected under that?", "Assemblyman Orentlicher: If physicians, as a class, choose the provider tax, then every physician in the state would get the protection of the freeze on the noneconomic damages cap.", "Assemblywoman Titus: Under section 6, subsection 2, the bill talks about future legislators declaring they would not raise the maximum amount of noneconomic damages.", "How can you commit a future legislative body to do something?", "How can you put that in a statement?", "We do not know what the next group makeup will be of this body.", "We cannot commit the future legislative body to what our decisions are today.", "We can pass NRS, but they are free to change it.", "I am worried this commits us to prevent future legislation.", "Would you clarify that?", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 2, 2021 Assemblyman Orentlicher: You are correct as a matter of legislative and constitutional principle.", "We cannot bind future legislatures.", "That said, this would say to future legislatures that we passed this bill; it had many parts.", "It is an integrated whole.", "If you start picking out one part, it is like unraveling a sweater when you start pulling on the thread, so that would be an inappropriate thing to do.", "Just to make sure that you think twice about trying to do something like that, if you do that, then section 6, subsection 6 of the amendment talks about how the Department of Health and Human Services will have entered into a contract with the provider group as part of the process of imposing the provider tax.", "If a future legislature raises the noneconomic damages cap, that will cancel the provider tax so that a future legislature would have to recognize that if they raise the noneconomic damages cap, they will have to start sending back tens of millions of dollars to the federal government.", "They will have to cut reimbursement rates to providers who take care of Medicaid recipients.", "And they will have to compromise access to care for Medicaid recipients.", "That is a price future legislatures will not want to pay.", "Assemblywoman Titus: I have lived in the real world of having an office practice, private practice, and working for the hospital district.", "I know that Medicare does not reimburse at cost now.", "It is difficult getting doctors to see Medicare patients.", "Your concern is that it is even worse getting doctors to see Medicaid patients because they pay at a lower rate.", "Right now, in Nevada, Medicaid pays 95 percent of the Medicare rate.", "At least that was the general reimbursement until we went into special session when we lowered Medicaid reimbursement an additional 6 percent, but it looks like we will go back up on that.", "Let us say Medicaid pays 95 percent of what Medicare pays.", "We know Medicare does not pay for our cost of doing business.", "I would see whoever walked through my office door.", "The issue was not my seeing them.", "The issue was my getting them referred to a provider who would see a Medicaid patient.", "I could not get them to see a Medicare patient.", "Where are the private insurers going to go?", "You are obligating private insurance companies, too, not just Medicaid and Medicare.", "We are talking about a global price control here.", "You are going to obligate private insurers.", "How will that encourage anybody to practice health care in Nevada?", "Although your intention is to have providers see more patients, I have concerns this is going to do the opposite based on what this bill presents today.", "I am anxious to hear some more discussion on it, but I am very concerned about price-setting and how that will impact me as a provider getting a patient whom I could not get seen for Medicare now, let alone getting them seen for Medicare in the future.", "This may affect Medicaid rates and people who see Medicaid and Medicare patients.", "For those who do not see these Medicaid and Medicare patients, is this going to force them to accept these same rates?", "If so, will there need to be changes in federal government regulations?", "Assemblyman Orentlicher: I am confident that if doctors are promised they will be paid fair reimbursement for all of their patients\u2014perhaps with Medicaid, not quite all the way, but pretty close\u2014that overall, they will receive fair reimbursement and will not have the hassle of dealing with negotiations with insurance companies and they will have extra protection against liability for malpractice.", "I think that is a pretty good deal.", "I am not worried about the appeal of that to Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 2, 2021 doctors around the country.", "For the doctors who want to earn excessive reimbursement and more than a fair income\u2014I think we will lose some people like that.", "From what I know about doctors, from what I know from myself as a doctor, there are going to be more doctors who will be attracted to Nevada than will want to earn excessive reimbursement.", "Maybe that is not good for patients, having doctors like that who care so much about how much they earn that a fair profit is not adequate.", "If they are not happy not earning excessive profits, that makes me worry about how they deal with their patients.", "Assemblywoman Titus: Would this commission determine arbitrarily what they decide is a fair reimbursement?", "The commission determines that, not the providers.", "Will the commission take into consideration research, development, advancing, or being able to grow a practice?", "Is it anywhere in the bill that the commission is going to allow for a reasonable profit margin so you can reimburse someone who is building a bigger practice, getting new equipment, getting modernization\u2014the costs of doing business that every other business has to look at?", "Will that be a factor considered?", "I do not see it in the bill.", "Assemblyman Orentlicher: That sounds like something that would be part of the concept of a reasonable profit.", "One of the reasons to have a profit is so that you can invest in expansion for the future.", "It is certainly something we could put in to make sure it is clear.", "Chair Nguyen: At this time, I will open the phone lines and take testimony in support of Assembly Bill 347.", "Alex Camberos, Private Citizen, Henderson,

illnesses.", "Eventually, I had to find my own insurance.", "I did my research.", "I found what was available for me, what covered my doctors.", "Even then, I still struggled to pay my premiums and my co-pays.", "I think it is a struggle that a lot of my friends experience.", "In Nevada, there are not enough folks who want to accept Medicaid because their reimbursement rate is too low.", "They cannot always see a doctor because they cannot afford to, even with insurance.", "I think what the bill brought forth by Assemblyman Orentlicher proposes is a good step in the right direction to further provide affordable health care for Nevadans.", "I urge this Committee to support this bill.", "Robert Gullickson, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: I am here to voice support for Assembly Bill 347 to help ensure that health care reimbursements are fair for both patients and providers.", "I want to clarify that today I am speaking on behalf of myself and not on behalf of the University

volunteering in clinics aimed at helping underserved populations both in southern Nevada and in northern Nevada.", "A lot of times these patients are not seen due to lack of providers who accept Medicaid.", "As a result, a lot of them slip through the cracks in our health care system.", "It is my belief that this bill will improve access to health care for Medicaid patients and, subsequently,

much-needed conversation that we have to have, given that we are in the midst of a pandemic.", "We know that we are about to foresee some more social, emotional, and learning issues that we are going to have to address in addition to our health issues.", "If we do not start this conversation now, we are going to be hurting down the road.", "We look forward to seeing this bill progress and to figuring out how we can come together in a bipartisan fashion to address the health care needs of every Nevadan.", "Marlene Lockard, representing Service Employees International Union, Local 1107: We

of this effort, it is imperative to acknowledge the heroic efforts undertaken by the health care workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "As efforts to vaccinate and control the pandemic continue,

the pandemic, the industry and the rest of society are clearly witness to their dedication, bravery, and stress.", "We are in a time of crisis, and health care workers are stepping up across the country and in Nevada to save lives, sacrifice their own health, and work to save the health of our communities.", "[A document from Marlene Lockard was also submitted but not discussed and is an exhibit for the hearing, Exhibit I].", "Chair Nguyen: We can go to our next caller in support.", "[There was no one.]", "At this time, I will begin testimony in opposition to Assembly Bill 347.", "I

to limit their remarks to the four to five minutes we talked about, then stay on the line to answer questions.", "Jaron Hildebrand, representing Nevada State Medical Association: I would like to thank Assemblyman Orentlicher for meeting with us and going over his proposed amendment and bill with us.", "We just cannot come to agreement.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 2, 2021 I would like to start with the provider tax piece.", "We are troubled by the fact that provider taxes would not be borne equally across the health care providers.", "There are many provider types within the Medicaid system that deliver care to patients that do not receive reimbursements.", "It is fundamentally unfair to select providers, skilled nursing facilities, hospitals, and physicians to bear the burden while other Medicaid providers\u2014home health agencies, personal care, hospice, behavioral health, et cetera\u2014who participate within the Medicaid system are exempt.", "Right now, there is only one state in the entire nation that has physician-specific provider taxes, the state of Minnesota.", "Those taxes are currently being phased out.", "There are certain requirements that we need to implement for the tax to actually work.", "Assemblyman Orentlicher alluded to the fact that over 60 percent of my providers in the state would need to participate.", "Our provider groups are not homogenous.", "We have a myriad of specialties and within those specialties we have subspecialties.", "Many of those specialties do not have a fair amount of Medicaid beneficiaries, but we have some that would make sense.", "For example, we can take a pediatrician in Clark County as a hypothetical.", "Some specialties like pediatrics have a subspecialty within them.", "Their practices can see 60-plus percent Medicaid beneficiaries.", "About 20 percent have the commercial payers.", "We need that 20 percent to absorb those costs because the Medicaid reimbursements are losing 40 cents on the dollar each time a physician sees a patient based on the lack of reimbursement.", "There are Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) rules that need to be implemented.", "The nationally approved provider tax implemented on skilled nursing would make sense because it benefits from this model.", "They have a set population group they serve.", "It makes sense for a skilled nursing facility to implement a provider tax to get a higher reimbursement rate on Medicaid.", "The taxes must be approved by CMS on three conditions: taxes must be broad-based and imposed on all providers, they must be uniformly imposed both on Medicaid and non-Medicaid providers, states must not hold providers harmless for the burden of the taxes although there is a safe harbor clause, and providers cannot exceed 6 percent of their revenues either putting into the tax or receiving the tax.", "The Peterson-Milbank Program for Sustainable Health Care Costs and the Primary Care Collaborative (PCC) picked Nevada as one of the five states to study this exact bill\u2014sustainable health care costs.", "We would prefer to see how we look at it and get hard data from the PCC.", "I would also like to touch on the rate-fixing piece.", "We can appreciate the fact that the Assemblyman would like to increase the Medicaid reimbursement rates because that is a major need for Nevada; however, we do not think the provider tax is the right mechanism due to the fact that our physician community with its various specialties could come to a 60 percent threshold to trigger the provider taxes for the reimbursement rates.", "With the medical malpractice piece, I do not know that is the right mechanism for the cap or for discussion on that piece.", "The Division of Health Care Financing and Policy produced a document in 2018 stating that aligning Medicaid rates for fiscal year 2018 would require an additional General Fund appropriation of almost $86 million and an additional $88 million for fiscal year 2019.", "That was close to $175 million just for those two years.", "This is a new biennium; perhaps the costs Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 2, 2021 could be an even further burden to the state.", "The $175 million is specific to fee-for-service rates.", "We still have 72 percent of all our Medicaid beneficiaries that run through managed care organizations (MCOs), which are based on contractual rates with physicians in our health care system.", "It is completely separate from fee-for-service.", "I have no idea how you would impose a provider tax on a provider running everything through an MCO by contract with the MCO.", "Those are my questions.", "I think the rate piece would be a deterrent to physicians coming to Nevada.", "I would like to explain how significant our provider shortage is.", "To get to the national average, for family medicine we would need an additional 288 providers.", "In internal medicine, we would need 211 physicians.", "For pediatricians, we would need an additional 244 physicians.", "For general surgery, we would need 123 additional surgeons.", "For obstetrics and gynecology, we would need an additional 111.", "I appreciate Assemblyman Orentlicher for trying to increase the Medicaid rates to a Medicare rate level, but we feel that is unsustainable for our small businesses and our small practices.", "We worry that would be the end of private practice and that doctors would become employed physicians.", "Those are our biggest concerns with this bill.", "Tom Clark, representing Nevada Association of Health Plans: We are the private insurance carriers here in the state.", "We make up only 19 percent of the health insurance marketplace.", "Our opposition comes down to the relationship that the health insurance providers have with providers.", "The impacts of the rate-setting commission and setting up those rates are going to send a ripple effect throughout the entire market.", "The Department of Health and Human Services, the Division of Insurance [within the Department of Business and Industry], the public and private insurers\u2014every aspect of health care has been trying to attract doctors to Nevada.", "Our biggest concern is not necessarily the reimbursement rate, although Medicaid reimbursements are well below what they need to be.", "Our concern is geography and demographics.", "When we look at attracting these doctors, we recognize as private insurers that there is a difference between a provider in Elko, Genoa, Carson City, Reno, or Las Vegas.", "Will the rate-setting commission see the difference?", "Will the rates be set at a rate that is taking in all those variables?", "Assemblyman Orentlicher has said that the commission may, but nothing in the bill states they will take those geographic and demographic concerns into account.", "For example, we need more African-American, more Hispanic, more LGBTQ providers in Nevada.", "We fear that setting one rate could send that ripple effect throughout the marketplace and not only keep those doctors from wanting to practice here, but also make it harder to retain the doctors we have.", "I also want to talk about the context of A.B.", "347 and what is happening within the health insurance system in Nevada and other pieces of legislation.", "There is an all-payer claims database (APCD).", "The all-payer claims database was Senate Bill 472 of the 80th Session.", "It did not pass, but the Patient Protection Commission picked up the ball.", "There were hearings in the Legislative Committee on Health Care during the interim that would create the APCD.", "While we were opposed to it back in 2019, because of the time that was taken to look at what the database could do and the infrastructure for doing it, we now support the legislation as it is amended and going forward.", "It is also important to recognize that is just Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 2, 2021 the collection of the data.", "The data is going to be used down the road to set policies like A.B.", "347 contemplates.", "If Senate Bill 40 passes and the bill Assemblywoman Carlton has that addresses the APCD passes, that creates the infrastructure for us to collect that data, we can have a stronger policy conversation about the health system.", "The Patient Protection Commission recently took testimony on a rate benchmark study they are going to move forward with.", "The information from that study could also provide integral information toward this plan.", "As I sit here contemplating my testimony, the other thing that comes to mind is that many of the bills this Committee has heard and that we are seeing at the Legislature address telehealth.", "We are in new times.", "Will the rate-setting commission take into consideration the issues around telehealth and how a provider is reimbursed based on the mechanism by which they provide care?", "The other thing I will mention is if this piece of legislation passes, we are very concerned about the effective date because there is no way we can stand up this type of system this year.", "For example, in the conversations we have had on the all-payer claims database, the infrastructure just to collect the data could take up to two years to set in motion.", "I will remain online for any questions.", "I want to thank Assemblyman Orentlicher for having the stakeholder meetings and the numerous one-on-one meetings.", "We had this conversation with him; we addressed our concerns one on one.", "James Wadhams, representing Nevada Hospital Association: Even though we are appearing in opposition, I want to start out on a positive note.", "Assemblyman Orentlicher has put in time and thought and has identified a major problem in this state; our constituents' access to Medicaid providers.", "The Medicaid reimbursement for hospitals averages about 57 percent of cost, which is substantially lower than even Medicare.", "The attractive opportunity to eliminate that deficit certainly would levelize a lot of costs that have to be shared otherwise.", "The problem, I think, is that raising money for Medicaid is truly a problem, and without that you cannot achieve even what has been perceived and represented as having been done in the state of Maryland.", "Maryland has Medicare, Medicaid, and all the providers under a common system.", "The way I read this bill, it would not include Medicaid or Medicare, so it would probably end up institutionalizing the problem of cost-shifting that Assemblyman Orentlicher clearly identified.", "As to the rate-setting commission, it seems to be roughly patterned after a public utilities commission regulatory system.", "It is easy to think about it in terms of what we see with Nevada Power, Sierra Pacific Power, NV Energy, or with other utilities that are regulated and are truly monopolies.", "They are monopolies because they are given a service territory and a franchise of service.", "The question is, is this really a competitive market?", "We do not have a single seller; we do not have an NV Energy in health care.", "Is there a restricted entry?", "Certainly not; in fact, the problem is the reverse.", "There is no restriction on entry, and we cannot develop the workforce that Jaron Hildebrand from the State Medical Association identified that we are so short of.", "On the hospital side, Elite Medical Center was developed in southern Nevada in the last few years.", "There is no bar to entry at all.", "Is there a lack of Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 2, 2021 innovation in the marketplace?", "It would be an indicator of a monopoly.", "That clearly is not the case.", "We have NICUs [neonatal intensive care units], burn units, trauma centers, and stroke centers\u2014a wide array of services\u2014and the technology is here.", "The comment that was made by an earlier speaker is worth mentioning.", "These past 13 months have been an extraordinary challenge for the health care system.", "It is fair to say the health care system has been stretched like a rubber band.", "The institutional capacity was identified early on by Governor Steve Sisolak as something we had to protect and make sure it did not get overrun.", "The personnel who staffed those hospitals from the physicians to the nurses to, frankly, everybody who keeps those hospitals operating have been a credit to their effort and to the ingenuity and innovation of those hospitals to allow that expansion and contraction to occur in a way that just last fall had a tremendous peak that was at least three times what we thought was our peak.", "I only mention \"peaks\" because the statistics show that our cases seem to be on the rise again.", "I would not want to predict a surge; I hope that does not occur, but that is an important issue for our current, very fragile health care system that was stretched financially in the last year.", "As Tom Clark mentioned, this is a competitive market.", "We have insurance companies competing for their customers.", "We do not have a concentration of one or two providers; we have major providers in direct competition.", "The University Medical Center, as a public hospital, is a major anchor hospital.", "We have the HCA facilities, the Valley Health System, Dignity Health, Renown Health, Prime Healthcare, and lots of nonmajor players that can be used competitively.", "It is a highly competitive market.", "While the problems that have been identified are representative and clearly problems we have because they impair access to health care, a rate-setting commission does not really address those problems.", "That is why we are in opposition to this bill.", "There may be other ways to approach this.", "I concur with Tom Clark when he referenced both the study being done by the Patient Protection Commission and the all-payer claims database that will begin to give the data that is going to be necessary to evaluate how you make these changes.", "Professor White caught my ear.", "The point Assemblyman Orentlicher and Professor White made so cogently is that we cannot compare Nevada to other countries; we have to compare our country to other countries, which suggests that the approach may need to be dealt with on the national level.", "We have had a change in the administration.", "President Joe Biden is getting his feet on the ground.", "The opportunity for the changes we saw in health care in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 that was passed generated trillions of dollars, and other actions that are taking place at the national level could very well provide some of the relief that will alleviate the problems we face with a highly stressed workforce and a capacity crunch.", "I think the problems we are dealing with are more on the national level than the local level.", "Contracting is always difficult.", "I respect that comment.", "We hear complaints about how difficult these negotiations are, so that does not suggest that these are being done by one-sided transactions with one person winning and the other person losing.", "These negotiations would not be tough if they were not being aggressively negotiated by both Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 2, 2021 parties.", "And there are multiple parties to negotiate with.", "I think this rate-setting commission is an interesting idea and raises a lot of points to be discussed, but it probably is not the solution at this point in time in the marketplace.", "I would be happy to stay on the line for any questions.", "That concludes my comments at this moment.", "George Ross, representing HCA Healthcare: First, I would like to compliment Assemblyman Orentlicher.", "He has put a tremendous amount of thought into this.", "We thank him for the time he spent going over this bill with the hospital industry.", "I would like to make a super compliment for the way he made the case for Medicaid rates.", "The most important improvement you could make to health care in Nevada is to raise Medicaid rates to match those of Medicare.", "I have never seen a more persuasive case for it.", "I just hope it was more persuasive than what we have seen over the last two decades.", "We are very grateful for last year's increase.", "I would like to echo James Wadhams that Nevada is not Maryland, it is not Massachusetts.", "It does not have great teaching hospitals; it does not have a panoply of wonderful, high-level doctors; it does not have massive access and quality.", "Instead, we are forty-fifth or fiftieth in every criteria.", "We are a growing state.", "What we have to be concerned with as we continue to grow is building more rooms, adding more beds, bringing in more doctors, and providing more investment.", "Until we meet those needs, that has to be the number one consideration.", "We should not be looking at bills that are going to retard and make that less likely.", "What we need to be doing is encouraging, not discouraging, investment.", "What is important here is the question of what costs are considered.", "Medicare only covers 89 percent of the costs.", "We can argue, and I heard Joseph White and Assemblyman Orentlicher imply those are reasonable costs.", "There are quite a few costs that are not there, a lot of costs hospitals incur are not recognized by that commission, and the return is based upon some but not all of the costs.", "The actual return the hospital sees will be significantly less than a fair and reasonable return.", "Hospitals and investors make their decisions based upon their own costs, the way they read the costs, and the return they see, not on the costs that a commission may see.", "That is critical.", "We heard the sponsor and his expert talk about how great this would be for consumers and customers of insurance companies, but there is not one thing in this bill that requires an insurance company to pass on any of those savings to the employers or the patients.", "There is nothing in there to require them to reduce deductibles, to reduce co-pays, to reduce co-insurance.", "There is nothing in there even to make them pay the rates the commission would set.", "We cannot charge anything but that, we cannot ask for anything but that; they do not have to pay it.", "I remind you all that a large portion of the payers in this state are Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) plans over which we have no control.", "Those are critical points.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 2, 2021 I would also like to point out that we were told this would eliminate surprise billing.", "We already did that last year, so it is already done.", "Additionally, we are concerned about the composition of the commission.", "That must be a very fair commission; it has to be a very balanced commission.", "In this bill, we have to have a way to appeal not just a commission decision because that is not in there either, or the timing of their decisions, or the timing of when they have to answer an appeal.", "Time is money.", "The longer we have to wait, the more one is dissuaded from making investments.", "We also have to have a way to appeal to the members of that commission if, in fact, we believe they are strongly biased in one way or another.", "I had a personal experience in the early part of my career in managing a group which kept an oil company's refining and marketing from breaking the rules.", "We had a massive number of rules on price controls.", "You end up spending most of your time and manpower figuring out how to be on board with the controls, how to make money out of the controls, and less time on figuring out good investments.", "In terms of cost savings, we were told we would be able to get rid of tons of administrative clerks.", "I remember going through all these cost cuttings.", "If you have a hundred bills and every one is different and you have a hundred bills to different entities that are exactly the same amount, you still have a hundred bills and you have a hundred entities to whom you pay and you have to keep track of them all.", "So you are not really going to save all that many people.", "I would have to emphasize again, we have to look at our own costs.", "I will remind you of the role Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center plays in the community.", "We are the largest Medicaid provider in the state.", "Forty-two percent of our patients are Medicaid recipients.", "Another 6 to 8 percent are uninsured, which basically means they do not pay.", "We have a large Medicare customer base.", "Only 16 percent of our patients use commercial insurance.", "We must get the money from those commercial client customers to pay that gap.", "I know that Assemblyman Orentlicher thinks this rate will solve that problem.", "He also says he wants to reward efficiency.", "We think we are extremely efficient.", "He wants to reward the severity of caseload.", "We have a comparatively high severity.", "If we get a higher rate to balance our poor mix, our efficiency, and our severity, we will be above the market and nobody will want to come.", "It is our experience that insurance companies value what they have to pay at a higher level than other factors.", "All of sudden we will be stuck, and we cannot bargain.", "Today, you could sit down and make a bargain with various companies, payers, and plans, and balance all the contents of that in such way that they are happy enough to come to the hospital as a customer and we are able to get enough money to pay and fill that hole.", "Under this system, I have no confidence that would be possible.", "Madam Chair, thank you very much for holding this hearing.", "It has been a balanced and fair hearing.", "Everybody is getting a fair chance to say his or her piece on what could be one of the most important bills that I have worked on in my 30 years of lobbying in Nevada.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 2, 2021 Chair Nguyen: Thank you.", "I wanted to give you the opportunity to correct yourself.", "I assume you did not mean to say that our teaching hospitals at University of Nevada, Las Vegas and University of Nevada, Reno were not excellent and not growing and not moving up in standings, but we just do not have the number of teaching hospitals that a state such as Massachusetts has.", "George Ross: They are doing very well.", "Chair Nguyen: I will go to the phone lines for testimony in opposition.", "Testimony will be limited to two minutes.", "Susan Fisher, representing Nevada State Society of Anesthesiologists; and the Nevada Orthopaedic Society: We are testifying in opposition to A.B.", "347.", "We appreciate the time Assemblyman Orentlicher spent with us, but we just cannot get there.", "No state has shown this provider tax to work, not one.", "Where it has been implemented, it has either been repealed or there have been no opt-ins.", "After several Medicaid cuts over the last 12 years, including a massive 43 percent cut for anesthesiologists during the Great Recession, this tax provides little assurance that more cuts will not happen.", "The economy goes south, medical providers get cut, and rates do not come back up accordingly when the economy rebounds.", "At a time when we are facing provider shortages and after the past year with provider burnout, this is not the time to introduce into Nevada's already overstressed health care environment an experiment that has failed elsewhere.", "We urge you not to process A.B.", "347.", "Dan Musgrove, representing Valley Health System of Hospitals: I will not be redundant.", "I appreciate the last comment you made before turning it over to more testimony in opposition.", "Nevada, this Legislature, and hospitals have worked very hard on expanding our graduate medical education program.", "The Valley Health System, including our Valley Hospital, runs about 75 medical students through our hospital every year, and we are looking to expand that program.", "You heard from Jaron Hildebrand that Nevada could become a place that physicians see as unfriendly.", "We work on the effort to train those doctors, and they end up leaving and heading elsewhere to pastures that are much greener.", "We certainly do not want to get back to McCarran International Airport being our health care facility of choice.", "I want to thank you, Chair, for allowing us to testify, and the sponsor for all the time he spent with all of us to try to listen to our concerns.", "Connor Cain, representing Henderson Chamber of Commerce: I would like to acknowledge and thank Assemblyman Orentlicher and Natalie Johns for all their work on this issue over the past few months.", "This included a meeting with the Henderson Chamber.", "Unfortunately, the feedback the Henderson Chamber has received on A.B.", "347 is that it exacerbates existing problems in our health care system.", "One issue to Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 2, 2021 highlight is that the theoretical foundation of A.B.", "347 is built on Medicaid rates being raised to Medicare rates, but the bill does not ensure this will occur.", "I will conclude by again thanking Assemblyman Orentlicher for his tireless work, but we are opposed to A.B.", "347.", "Brian Kleven, Chief Financial Officer, Dignity Health-St. Rose Dominican: Dignity Health-St. Rose Dominican represents the only not-for-profit health system in southern Nevada.", "I am calling in opposition to A.B.", "347.", "I will say, \"Ditto,\" to most of what my colleagues said, but will add a few points.", "Medicare rates do not cover our costs, and there is no guarantee in this bill that either the State or the commission would pay providers higher than Medicare rates, which concerns us significantly.", "Also, the bill does not provide a way to appeal commission decisions or address conflicts of interest on the rate commission, which is massively concerning.", "In addition to previous testimony, there are many unknowns related to this bill.", "It is extremely difficult for my team to determine the kind of impact it would have on the St. Rose system.", "One issue I can speak to.", "If commercial insurance rates were set at Medicare levels, that issue alone would equate to a $183 million bottom-line reduction to our market that serves the greater Las Vegas area.", "This could very possibly lead to elimination of needed service lines we provide to the community and possible job elimination for the very employees who saved lives during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "In 2020 alone, which was an extremely difficult year with the pandemic, St. Rose contributed over $154 million in community benefits.", "Because St. Rose is a not-for-profit system, any earnings we have are reinvested back into the community to bolster Nevada's limited public health structure and pay for charity care.", "St. Rose has been doing the right thing in this community since 1947, and this bill would jeopardize our ability to adequately treat patients in our community.", "The rate-setting commission is wrong for Nevada.", "Thank you for your time and for serving as elected officials during these trying times.", "Joseph Heck, representing Nevada Osteopathic Medical Association: We are in opposition to the bill for all the reasons previously stated by the other opponents.", "The only thing I would like to add is the use of noneconomic medical malpractice damages as a potential benefit would have no additional benefit, as medical malpractice noneconomic damages are already capped at $350,000 in Nevada law as instituted by voter initiative in 2004.", "We appreciate Assemblyman Orentlicher's long-range vision to try to increase access and lower costs, but we feel this bill is not the right way to go about it.", "Jesse Wadhams, representing Vegas Chamber: We agree with the opposition, and we thank Assemblyman Orentlicher for his vision.", "Jessica Ferrato, representing American College of Emergency Physicians, Nevada Chapter: I would like to thank Assemblyman Orentlicher for his consistent outreach and

the low Medicaid rates throughout the state because we take all those patients.", "Even though ER physicians are positioned to benefit the most from a provider tax because we see more Medicaid patients than any others, we still have some concerns on how it will work in this bill.", "We are worried about unanticipated impacts to providers and patients; we have concerns that there are not any \"hold harmless\" provisions available for providers to ensure that money that is put into the fund comes back to the providers in the form of increased rates.", "In terms of the rate-setting commission, we have concerns.", "Setting rates at Medicare levels during the pandemic or otherwise is problematic.", "There are not any emergency doctors who can operate solely off Medicare rates; they do not cover costs.", "In addition, the wording in the bill around how this commission would raise rates appears subjective.", "Medicare rates are a significant barrier for recruiting in Nevada, which impacts patient care.", "This comes in the form of provider shortages, long wait times to see a provider, and even wait times and availability for procedures.", "We are concerned about the

increasing Medicaid reimbursement rates in Nevada.", "However, we do not believe the provisions of this bill will achieve that goal, and they will ultimately end up increasing the cost of health care for the citizens of Nevada.", "The design of the rate-setting commission in this bill puts restrictions on only one portion of the health care market, putting the hospital community at a disadvantage.", "Others have already addressed the issue of costs, so I will just echo those comments.", "North Vista is not a large hospital, but we are the only hospital located in North Las Vegas.", "Unlike other hospital systems with multiple locations in Las Vegas, we have just the one campus.", "This means we do not have as much ability to make up in volume what is lost from one

Orentlicher: Would Professor White or other copresenters like to make comments?", "Joseph White: I would like to say a couple of things.", "There is very strong evidence that there are substantial extra costs associated with billing in the American health care system and Nevada's.", "It is not the case that sending out the same number of bills when the bills are all by the same rules is just as expensive as sending out that number of bills with extremely complicated different rules about what is involved.", "If that were the case, then the amount of billing expense in the United States and Canada or the United States and many other countries would not be so different.", "I think there are savings to be had.", "The savings related to administrative costs and the complexity of the billing are in the range of 5-10 percent of costs, according to most of the studies that have been done.", "There have been studies that show the average American physician practice is spending about $80,000 per doctor on billing.", "It is much lower in other countries.", "There is a savings; there are inefficiencies there.", "Given that we spend so much more money than other countries, we should be looking for a way to get those savings.", "The most obvious way to get those savings is with standardized prices and all-payer payment.", "I cannot speak to the question of the shortages of physicians in Nevada.", "It is for you to think about what the reasons are for that.", "Right now, it is true that costs per capita in Nevada are lower than in a lot of other states.", "Costs per capita for physician services, however, are not.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 2, 2021 They are about the same as the average in other states.", "They are lower because of things like hospital payments and some services like home health.", "I do not know why that is.", "I think there is an important point made here about thinking about the different providers that are involved\u2014on the Medicaid side, that can be skilled nursing facilities, home health, and so on\u2014and thinking about the different providers that are involved with other aspects of health care.", "I think it is important to remember that a lot of employer-based health care is through ERISA plans.", "If costs are lower for employers, maybe they will not pass the savings along, but it is not a matter of their negotiations with insurers because they are simply experiencing the cost directly, and the insurers are simply processing for them.", "I think you need to think about how the ERISA plans work out in this process.", "There is a lot to think about.", "There are legitimate questions to ask about supply and what is going on with Nevada costs overall.", "Nevada has a low number of doctors per capita.", "It also has a relatively younger population than most states but not in line with the number of doctors.", "I think there are significant questions about what attracts doctors.", "It is possible that having a system which is much less of a hassle for doctors, in terms of billing and dealing with the cost structure in their practices, could logically mean it would be easier for doctors to be in smaller or solo practice instead of selling out to larger practices in part to handle all that.", "There are savings out there.", "It would seem like a good idea to capture them in some way.", "Assemblyman Orentlicher: Thank you, members of the Committee, and all the stakeholders who worked with me over the past few months.", "I would like to say a few things in response to some of the comments from those in opposition.", "There were some things said that are not accurate representations of the bill.", "Jaron Hildebrand was concerned about whether the provider tax would be equitable.", "His concern was that not all doctors see Medicaid patients, but all would pay the tax.", "It is true that the only way you receive money back, a 3-to-1 return\u2014that is guaranteed, it is not speculative\u2014for every dollar the providers put in, three dollars come back, but only if you take care of Medicaid patients.", "To me, that is a good thing in terms of equity because it says that the more you see Medicaid patients, the more you are willing to provide care to the neediest among us, the more you will get paid.", "I think that is good.", "It provides an incentive to see Medicaid patients.", "For those doctors who are in a specialty or a location where there is not an opportunity to see Medicaid patients, one way to meet their responsibility to share in the care of Medicaid patients is to pay toward their care if they cannot provide the care themselves.", "I think in terms of equity, this is designed very well.", "James Wadhams suggested the health care market is a competitive market.", "That is at odds with the understanding of every health economist I am aware of.", "The reason we need the rate-setting commission is the health care market does not operate like a competitive market.", "We have excessive and highly varying prices.", "Nobody in the health economics world thinks this is working properly.", "That is why we need government intervention to correct the market failure.", "For providers and patients, we are saying we want to ensure all providers are compensated fairly.", "We cover their costs and a reasonable profit.", "That means there will be providers available for patients.", "We are saying to providers that we will eliminate all this Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 2, 2021 administrative complexity that Professor White talked about.", "They do not need to have negotiations or spend hours a day filling out different forms for different providers and doing all these different negotiations.", "And we will provide stronger protection against the threat of professional liability.", "I have heard over the years from health care providers that those things are important.", "They want to be paid fairly; they do not like to deal with administrative paperwork and bureaucratic hassle; and they want to be protected against unfair malpractice litigation.", "All those things are in the bill.", "The only thing they do not get is the ability to charge excessive profits.", "We do not want them to gouge patients.", "That is the only thing they do not get out of

the patient about the benefits of discussing their decision to request the medication with their religious, faith, spiritual, or support leader.", "That is another provision being recommended and this

not just about the small number of people who choose to use the law, it is about all the people who get the peace of mind of knowing that, should their suffering become too great, they have an option.", "We also know that when the law gets implemented, what the evidence and data show\u2014and there is a Journal of Medical Ethics report that showed this\u2014is that there is no concern about

peace of mind simply knowing the medication is there and they have the option should they need it.", "Research from a Journal of Palliative Medicine article demonstrated that medical aid in dying also improves end-of-life care generally by contributing to more candid conversations between doctors and patients, higher hospice usage rates, and improved palliative care training for physicians.",

years.", "Polling data which was just completed in Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 7, 2021 your state last month shows that Nevada voters want this compassionate option; three

professional associations have endorsed or dropped their opposition to medical aid in dying in support of the growing reality that this is something the American public wants.", "The Nevada State Medical Association has taken a neutral position on medical aid in dying.", "We no longer have to hypothesize about what is going to happen when this law gets implemented.", "The evidence is very clear: medical aid in dying protects vulnerable populations; it affords dying people autonomy and compassion during the most difficult time; it improves end-of-life care generally by resulting in more conversations about hospice care and improved palliative care training; and it costs almost nothing to implement.", "The cost of inaction, however, is truly immense.", "Without the option of medical aid in dying, terminally ill individuals may not try that one last miracle treatment because often it is the treatment itself that causes the most amount of suffering.", "They are afraid to try that one last treatment without knowing that they have this option available.", "They may also choose violent means to end their suffering, and they could experience needless agony when they die while families and doctors remain powerless with no legal way to respond to their pleas for help.", "Terminally ill residents do not have the luxury of endless deliberations.", "They need the relief this law affords them right now.", "Not a single additional person will die if you authorize medical aid in dying, but far fewer will suffer.", "On behalf of our thousands of supporters across the state,

years.", "I am pleased to be able to share my experience with you.", "As a social worker who has built a career caring for and working with people who are dying, I want to reflect on the vulnerability and honesty with which Assemblyman Flores shared his story with us today.", "I hear stories like this every day\u2014about people who are dying; people who would qualify for Oregon's Death with Dignity Act or people who do not.", "One thing that it is important to remember is that we all get one death and we all deserve an option like death with dignity.", "One of the most difficult things for a terminally ill individual is the silence\u2014the silence surrounding the dying experience\u2014and the silence arises out of society's unwillingness to face death directly.", "I know at least one family in the state of Nevada tonight will have a difficult conversation about dying, last wishes, and advanced directives because they were somehow engaged with or heard about this hearing today.", "That is meaningful.", "What is also meaningful is the care with which this bill before you has been constructed.", "We have ten other jurisdictions with death with dignity bills.", "What I know is that this bill in front of you represents the best of all those pieces of legislation.", "It provides strong, time-proven safeguards which have been well covered by Assemblyman Flores.", "These safeguards protect vulnerable individuals from coercion and at the same time, these safeguards do not act as Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 7, 2021 barriers to access for those who need it.", "This bill strikes a tension between protection and access and this tension is difficult to strike, and our team in Nevada has worked with all the necessary stakeholders to get this bill just right.", "The proposed law you are considering today is at its core a medical standard of care, so when you go through section by section, you can see what a physician has to do in order to prescribe medication to a patient who requests a hastened death.", "By enacting this law, the Nevada Legislature will send a strong message that a compassionate response to suffering is available in the state through medical aid in dying, but that health care providers must follow the carefully regulated safeguards you are considering today.", "Assembly Bill 351 puts decisions about easing suffering in the hands of terminally ill patients, allowing them to engage their family members, their physicians, clergy members, and anyone else they choose\u2014if they so choose.", "It sets aside outdated and archaic government bans on a medical practice that is currently legal for 72 million Americans, a practice that is validated, researched, effective, and full of safeguards to protect vulnerable populations.", "Nevada has considered similar legislation in the past, and those of you who have engaged in this debate in prior sessions know you will hear a lot of negative accusations about this bill.", "For more than two decades now, we have heard these same slippery slope arguments\u2014the statement that this law will target individuals who are poor, living with disabilities, the elderly\u2014statements suggesting that those without medical care or access to health care resources will be forced to end their lives using medical aid in dying because it is cheaper than treating cancer.", "These slippery slope arguments are just not true.", "Independent researchers have concluded that the results are quite the opposite.", "One group of researchers explored data out of Oregon to determine if there was a disproportionate impact on ten groups of potentially vulnerable patients.", "The data led the researchers to conclude, and I quote, \"There is no current factual support for so-called slippery slope concerns about the risks of legalization of assisted dying.", "These patients are not at risk.\"", "I have already read letters to the editor published in Nevada suggesting that death with dignity will undermine hospice and palliative care services, and the researchers are clear on this point also.", "In a study published in the Journal of Palliative Medicine, research concluded, and I quote, \"Another concern regarding the legalization of physician-aided dying is that physician-aided dying would become a substitute for quality end-of-life care.", "This study adds to the evidence that the choice to pursue physician-aided dying does not appear to be due to or a reflection of poor end-of-life care.\"", "What we do know for the states that have enacted death with dignity laws, the point is that people have access to death with dignity and hospice care.", "It is not one or the other.", "The data demonstrate that they come together in all the jurisdictions that have enacted death-with-dignity legislation.", "A lot of people want to speak against the Oregon experience, and you will probably hear that today, but in almost

years.", "Oregon's law works as intended\u2014to give dying and suffering patients more options at the end of life.", "I very much Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 7, 2021

Matthews.", "Assemblyman Matthews: It has been noted that this bill has been modeled with Oregon's Death with Dignity Act, and I also know the stated intent of this bill is to provide options to those who are suffering and those who are experiencing unbearable pain.", "The Oregon Health Authority's own data summary on that state's Death with Dignity Act notes that in most cases, current pain or even concern about future pain is not cited by patients as a reason for obtaining these drugs.", "But rather, the number one reason listed by patients to die from assisted suicide is being a burden to family and friends and loss of enjoyment in the usual activities.", "Given the intent of this bill, what safeguards, if any, are in place to ensure we do not see the same thing happen here in Nevada?", "Kim Callinan: It is important to remember that Oregon data is coming from a doctor filling out a form about their perception of why the patient is choosing to use the option.", "It is not the patient's self-reported reason for choosing the option.", "Also, when you are talking to a patient who is at the end of life, it is not just about pain, but it is about all the pain and suffering they are experiencing.", "Assemblyman Flores spoke to it so beautifully in the beginning when he talked about his own personal experience watching his loved one who was going through this.", "A person who is at the end of their life, they are going through a whole host of things.", "It is the totality of that experience that determines whether they are suffering too much.", "Really, only the dying person can decide how much suffering is too much.", "I do not see the Oregon data as a problem.", "It is a very small number of people who choose the option.", "They are getting peace of mind in knowing that they do not have to suffer from whatever their definition of suffering is.", "Again, they are terminally ill; they are already going to die; the question is how they die and not if they are going to die.", "Assemblywoman Thomas: My question has to do with our Black, Brown, and people of color who at times have had a discouraging experience with health care personnel.", "Is there any data showing that people who are in a minority have experienced a reception of the same outcome as with dignity when they decided that life was enough for them?", "Are they discouraged when it comes to accepting this as a final episode in their life's journey?", "Kim Callinan: We share your commitment to health equity at life's end and have an initiative going with our African-American and Latino

Services April 7, 2021 entire end-of-life care spectrum\u2014hospice, palliative care, pain management.", "Unfortunately, Black and Brown Americans are less likely to enroll in hospice care and get adequate pain management and all the things you are referencing.", "That is a huge commitment and priority for the organization.", "In terms of this bill, what ends up existing, if you look at the data, is that very few minorities take advantage of the option.", "One of the things that is positive and good about the initiative is that everything is self-directed.", "The person has to make the request; they are in charge of the process from start to finish.", "With this end-of-life option, there is not a chance that a person is going to be coerced into using the option because it is entirely self-directed.", "What we see is that a lot of public education is needed in order to ensure that African Americans, Latinos, other minority populations are aware of and taking advantage of all end-of-life care options that are available to them so they are able to make the best decisions they can for themselves.", "The bill has the potential to help ignite that because, as Peg Sandeen said in her opening remarks, what we see happen is this legislation opens the door to people finally having a conversation that they otherwise avoid.", "It might open up because there is a bill hearing; it might open up because they see a media article; it might open up because now they ask their doctor.", "That is why we see increased enrollment into hospice care after the legislation is implemented into a state.", "A patient goes in and says, \"I want to be in control of my end.\"", "It opens up the door for that conversation and then you have doctors and patients finally having a conversation about what kind of end-of-life care options you have.", "It ends up improving end-of-life care across the board.", "As an organization, we are very committed to addressing the inequities that exist across all end-of-life care.", "This bill does work to ensure that no one will be pushed into this as an option in its current form.", "Assemblywoman Titus: Thank you, Assemblyman Flores, for sharing your story.", "You should never apologize for being human and having emotions.", "I am honored to hear your story today.", "These are emotional issues.", "As a physician, I have been involved with hundreds of patients at the time of their deaths, understanding their fears and concerns.", "I have had patients ask me not to let them suffer, saying that they are worried about pain.", "That is always my question to them, \"What are you afraid of?\"", "I was there for them and actively involved, making sure we had palliative care and making sure we had hospice care.", "That concern about death with dignity and making sure they do not suffer\u2014usually I can solve that for them and make sure that does not happen, but I never actively engaged in ending their life.", "I would like to focus on the bill; the rest is all about emotion.", "I have some concerns\u2014which is one of several reasons why in the past this bill has not been passed.", "First and foremost, there was testimony that there was no abuse of this in Oregon; however, in section 1, it is forbidden for a coroner to investigate the case.", "When someone has a prescription, how would we know if the case was abuse or not when the coroner is forbidden to investigate?", "How do we know there is not abuse when you cannot investigate it?", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 7, 2021 Kim Callinan: The intention of the language in section 1 is that if the person has chosen this as an option, there is nothing to investigate because you know they are going to take the prescription medication.", "If there was some reason or suspicion of foul play, of course the coroner would be able to investigate.", "It is not stopping an investigation if there is foul play, but if a person has chosen this as an option and has gone through the process, there is not a reason to investigate because the investigation is going to show that they have taken a prescription to end their suffering.", "Assemblywoman Titus: I disagree with that.", "Just because they got the prescription does not mean they are ever going to use it.", "You have testified that many people apply for this and then do not use it.", "Does the fact they have applied for the prescription negate any other studies or investigations?", "I have to disagree with you there.", "Next are sections 3 and 25.", "I, as a doctor of 36 years, have signed many death certificates.", "In that death certificate are categories: immediate cause of death, associated cause of death, up to five lines on underlying causes of death.", "In your bill, it mandates that we have to sign what the diagnosis was that allowed them to obtain this medication\u2014that six-month diagnosis.", "We all know, and you have to know, that just because a doctor says someone is going to die within six months\u2014I have had patients die in a week, and I have had patients die many years later.", "The diagnosis of six months does not mean that is inevitable.", "I believe there is a power greater than me, and to say someone is going to be dead in six months, frequently that does not happen.", "My concern is by not being able to sign that the person did indeed take an assisted suicide drug.", "Say they took it within a day of getting that suicide drug and their diagnosis was pancreatic cancer.", "The average lifespan of someone with pancreatic cancer is six months, but now this person has died in two weeks and not from pancreatic cancer but from taking this medication.", "That skews the data on what the average lifespan is for a person with X disease.", "We are looking at terminal diseases here.", "Not being allowed to say, \"No, they took this medication,\" but with the caveat of having a terminal disease.", "By saying they died of pancreatic cancer, which is absolutely not true\u2014they died from the medication, because I would write down as the immediate cause of death, respiratory distress, heart attack.", "Why is that any different?", "The underlying cause would still be pancreatic cancer; it does not take away the fact that they had that disease.", "But why the push for not giving the truth\u2014the fact that they died from an overdose of medication?", "Kim Callinan: Dr. Grube is on the line, and I think he can respond to this one.", "David Grube, M.D., Private Citizen, Philomath, Oregon: I am a retired family physician in Oregon, and I did respond to patient requests regarding aid in dying.", "I appreciate your question because I have heard this many times and we have had many conversations with other physicians about this.", "From my perspective, and possibly the Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 7, 2021 perspective of the bill, there are two reasons for the death certificate.", "One is to establish the legal parameters of the estate and the other is the epidemiology of the disease that you talked about.", "The latter will be covered by the reporting requirements that you will have in Nevada and that we have in Oregon.", "That data will be coming to the state for epidemiological concerns.", "The death certificate, however, is a public document and discoverable by anybody.", "When Death with Dignity or Medical Aid in Dying\u2014the name of the bill\u2014is on the death certificate, that has implications publicly for the family, for intimacy, for HIPAA [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act] violations, et cetera.", "I think your concerns are addressed by the reporting requirements your State of Nevada requires.", "Assemblywoman Titus: I respectfully disagree.", "In section 28, I am mandated to refer to another physician.", "Is there a timeline in the bill that says how much time I have to make that referral?", "Is there going to be a list published somewhere so that I, as a provider, have a list of other providers who are willing to do this?", "How does that work?", "Kim Callinan: There is not a time frame in the bill.", "It is expected that, in the same way you would refer someone in a timely manner to any other provider, you would do the same with medical aid in dying.", "It is asking you to follow the normal practice of medicine and refer the patient out.", "There is also the option of referring the person for information.", "It does not mandate that it has to be to another provider who will practice medical aid in dying.", "It could also be to a general information source.", "Assemblywoman Titus: Who pays for the medication?", "You get this prescription, you go to the pharmacist, and section 29 mandates that the pharmacist fill it.", "What is the average cost and what if they cannot pay?", "Does the pharmacy have to dispense the medication?", "Kim Callinan: Most of the time the person is paying for the medication themselves, or some of the states that have medical aid in dying have allowed for the medication to be paid for through their state Medicaid program.", "Also, private insurance often does cover the medication.", "It runs about $550 to $600.", "Assemblywoman Titus: And there is no shortage of supply.", "David Grube: There is no shortage of supply at the present time.", "The prescription is a compounded prescription of currently available medications.", "Assemblywoman Titus: Sections 42 and 43 mandate that insurance companies cannot deny someone insurance coverage even though they have noted that they are going to take this medication.", "For me, Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 7, 2021 the person can get a terminal illness, say, \"I am going to get this medication and then apply for life insurance.\"", "From a business standpoint, it seems as though you are putting a huge burden on the insurance companies.", "How does that work in Oregon?", "Can they still issue a life insurance policy, yet the person knows he or she has a terminal illness?", "David Grube: These people are about to die.", "Not one of them would be available for life insurance if they recovered.", "In Oregon, 95 percent of them are already enrolled in hospice, so they are covered in that way.", "There is no possibility that this group of people would be eligible for life insurance.", "Assemblywoman Titus: Why is it in the bill that you cannot refuse life insurance?", "Section 43 says that specifically: you cannot deny under a group policy, cancel a policy, or refuse to issue an insurance policy if you apply.", "To me, they could apply once they get the diagnosis.", "David Grube: We do not have that as part of our Death with Dignity Act in Oregon.", "Assemblywoman Titus: Section 43, subsection 1, paragraph (b), you cannot \"Refuse to sell, provide, or issue .", ".", ".", "life insurance\" to someone who applies for this.", "Kim Callinan: That was not the intention.", "It could have been that something got reworded in bill drafting.", "That is certainly something I am sure we can look at with Assemblyman Flores.", "If your conclusion is correct, we would be supportive of an amendment if he was.", "Assemblywoman Titus: Thank you all for your presentation.", "Thank you, Madam Chair, for your tolerance of my line of questioning, but I just felt these questions needed to be asked.", "Chair Nguyen: Assemblywoman Titus, if you have additional questions, please ask them.", "Do you have further questions?", "Assemblywoman Titus: Madam Chair, I have a bunch more, but I know other folks have questions, so thank you.", "Assemblywoman Krasner: I would like to say thank you to Assemblyman Flores for sharing his personal story with us.", "My question is for Ms. Callinan.", "In preparing for this hearing today, I did a lot of reading and read several articles on the topic.", "I am glad she talked about protecting vulnerable populations.", "In some articles I was reading about the limitations on safeguards for vulnerable populations.", "Is there anywhere in the bill where there are safeguards preventing Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 7, 2021 an insurance company from delaying or denying expensive treatments\u2014for say, cancer\u2014causing the person to suffer, almost pushing or encouraging someone to choose end-of-life prescriptions?", "This is something I saw on the National Council on Disability, which said that when assisted suicide is legalized, it immediately becomes the cheapest treatment; \"direct coercion is not necessary.\"", "If insurers deny or even simply delay approval of expensive life-sustaining treatment, patients can be steered toward hastening their death.", "Could you comment on that?", "Kim Callinan: The decisions an insurance company makes about whether to provide care have nothing to do with the medical aid-in-dying laws being in a state or not.", "Insurance companies look to see whether a treatment meets their criteria and that is what determines whether they do that.", "The bill does not allow for an insurance company to deny treatment and then offer medical aid in dying as an option.", "If that was really happening, if that was the way it worked across the states, we would not have 4,300 people utilizing the law across the combined 50 years of experience.", "The law requires that the person be the one who is making the request and asking for the option.", "While I understand that is a concern, the legislation does address that concern.", "David Grube: That is a concern I have heard before, but it is not a reality.", "The experience in Oregon does not show that has ever happened.", "This group of people are near death, and have been through all the kinds of treatment.", "It is not as though they are being denied a last treatment.", "This is a group of hospice patients for the most part, so that is not something we have ever seen happening in Oregon.", "Assemblywoman Gorelow: You mentioned that 43 people have chosen this.", "Was this just in Oregon or is that a total number?", "Kim Callinan: It is 43,000 people across all the authorized states that collect data, which is about nine states over 50 years.", "Assemblywoman Gorelow: In section 22, it says that the patient must be able to ingest the medication themself.", "Is this in pill form or a liquid?", "David Grube: The current protocol is a liquid of about four ounces, or half a glass of water, that is drunk.", "The individual will fall asleep in about ten minutes and die very peacefully in less than an hour.", "It can sometimes come as a powder that the family would mix with a liquid, so it could be a powder or a liquid form, but it is not a pill.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 7, 2021 Assemblywoman Gorelow: My last question concerns section 28, which states that a pharmacy does not have to dispense such medication.", "Has that been a barrier in other states?", "David Grube: I had a woman who went four miles in her electric wheelchair, as she was dying of breast cancer, to get a prescription.", "I live in a small town, and the pharmacist that day did not believe in death with dignity and would not dispense the medication that was sitting on the shelf.", "She went all the way back to her residence and had to return another day, so this is a thing that can happen.", "Kim Callinan: David Grube is right; this is something that can happen.", "The good news is that we have more pharmacies participating, and with the ability to mail, we have been able to mitigate this as an issue, but it is a challenge that we have to work through after the law gets implemented.", "Assemblywoman Gorelow: You mentioned it can be mailed to a patient as well.", "Assemblyman Flores: Madam Chair, could I go back to the question posed by Assemblywoman Titus?", "Chair Nguyen: Go ahead, and I know Karly O'Krent with the LCB [Legislative Counsel Bureau] Legal Division can also assist.", "Assemblyman Flores: Referring to section 42, page 31, lines 42 through 45, you posed a question as to whether we were somehow tying the hands of an insurance provider by including that section.", "I wanted to clarify that an insurance company now can still refuse based on someone having a terminal disease or illness.", "They can still do that.", "What this section is clarifying is that they cannot say they are not going to, based on the fact that the medication has been requested.", "We wanted to specifically delineate that so we are not sending mixed messages.", "The insurance company, as they do now, would be allowed to refuse based on the fact that someone has a terminal illness.", "That does not change; this is just specifically denying on the basis of the actual request for the medication.", "Assemblywoman Titus: Thank you for that clarification.", "I will follow up offline because I still have some concerns about that provision being in there.", "It may be the only thing they know about the patient.", "Chair Nguyen: I would encourage Assemblywoman Titus to reach out to Ms. O'Krent.", "I know she provided a similar answer.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 7, 2021 Assemblyman Hafen: I want to thank Assemblyman Flores for bringing this bill forward.", "It has made me do some soul-searching and made me do some research in the Bible, because this is a very tough conversation for us to be having today.", "In some research in the other states that have had the assisted suicide path, we have seen a direct correlation with increased suicides.", "My concern is that with the recent pandemic and lockdown, we have seen a dramatic increase in suicide attempts.", "Is there an explanation about why we are seeing a direct correlation with states that have passed assisted suicide\u2014specifically Oregon\u2014and the increase in suicide?", "David Grube: I will send you an article that recognizes there is not a correlation between increased suicides in Oregon and our Death with Dignity Act.", "It is probably based more on the fact that our population has increased and other situations and stressors.", "Suicide in America is a huge problem that we in medicine and in all parts of our society need to address genuinely.", "However, it is not true that there is a direct correlation between the passage of the Death with Dignity Act in Oregon and suicides in our state.", "Peg Sandeen: I echo what Dr. Grube said.", "There is not a direct correlation and there is statistical evidence that there is not a direct correlation between suicide and enactment of the Oregon Death with Dignity Act.", "Suicide patterns are different across the United States.", "Some states have higher levels; some states have lower levels, but it is not related to the existence of any of the death with dignity acts.", "Assemblyman Hafen: I would appreciate looking at the data because the data I looked at is showing that Oregon's suicide rate is 41 percent higher than the national average.", "If I understand it, the problem is not the assisted suicide but the increase in population; however, I am confused about why an increase in population would be the rationale for a percentage increase.", "I could see the number increase, but not a percentage increase over the national average being caused by population.", "Could you clarify that?", "David Grube: I did not mean that it was an increase in the percentage.", "That is not part of the argument that shows there is no correlation, and I will send you that study so you can read that.", "You are correct.", "Chair Nguyen: Committee members have been inundated with emails in support and in opposition to A.B.", "351.", "With reference to high suicide rates in Oregon since 1999, do we have any indication what the suicide rates were in Oregon prior to this?", "Is it too hard to make a specific correlation between their law and those rates without taking into consideration other factors like COVID-19, other forms of isolation, weather, or any of those things?", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 7, 2021 Kim Callinan: When you look at the studies looking at suicide rates, there is no correlation.", "There are so many different factors, as you noted, that could lead to suicide.", "The thing that actually shows is that the Western states that have laxer gun laws are the ones that have higher suicide rates.", "That is where the correlation exists.", "If you look at the states that have enacted medical aid-in-dying laws that are on the East Coast, there are lower suicide rates there.", "There is no correlation, there is no causation; they are very independent.", "Chair Nguyen: I do not see any other questions.", "Assemblywoman Titus, would you like me to go back to you for additional questions?", "Assemblywoman Titus: I have a question about being a Nevada resident.", "A lot of people became Nevada residents because of our divorce laws many years ago, as in other states it took a long time to get divorced.", "Numerous places in northern and southern Nevada were established because people could get divorces here.", "When you say \"Nevada resident,\" there is no limitation that you have to be here for, say, six months.", "What is the definition of a Nevada resident?", "Could they be here just a week and be considered a Nevada resident?", "Kim Callinan: There is no time frame for how long someone has to be within the state.", "It is really about whether you have a government ID, voter registration, all the normal ways you would establish residency.", "However, there are two important things to keep in mind.", "Your bordering states of Oregon and California already have this as an option, so the idea that Nevada would become a suicide mecca for this is highly unlikely both because you are seeing so many other states adopt this as an option.", "But in addition to that, people at the end of their lives do not have the wherewithal, the means, the physical ability to pick up and move.", "People choose this option because they want to be able to die at home surrounded by their loved ones.", "Very few people have the wherewithal and are able to just pick up at the end of their lives after getting a terminal diagnosis, be able to reestablish residency someplace, and be able to go through the 13-step process in order to access the law.", "In the history of it being authorized in all the states, there are a couple of examples where people have successfully moved to a state in order to access the option, but those are few and far between.", "Assemblywoman Titus: In choosing the age of 18 instead of, say, 21, have you seen an age difference in who requests this medication?", "Kim Callinan: When you look at the data across all the authorized states, generally speaking, you see that older people are accessing the option.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 7, 2021 David Grube: The average age has always been over 70.", "The exceptions are generally the neurodegenerative diseases like ALS

will develop breast cancer.", "With a BRCA 1 or 2 mutation, that risk goes to 56 percent up to 87 percent.", "These ranges occur because different studies make different predictions; but one way or the other, this is a huge increase in the risk of developing breast cancer.", "It also affects the development of ovarian cancer [page 5].", "Approximately 1 percent of the female population in this country will develop ovarian cancer during her lifetime, but with BRCA 1 or 2 gene mutations, those risks go up dramatically.", "I am sure all of you know that ovarian cancer is frequently not

80 to 85 percent will have either a BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 mutation.", "However, it has become obvious that there are many other genes involved in this hereditary predisposition as well.", "It is more than just the development of cancer; it includes considerations of the development of a second, independent cancer [page 7].", "Five percent of all women who will develop breast cancer within five years of the original diagnosis will develop a second breast cancer, but if you have a mutation in either BRCA 1 or BRCA 2, that number goes to 12 to 20 percent.", "Over a woman's lifetime, if she develops breast cancer, the risk of a second primary breast cancer is about 11 percent, but with a mutation in either BRCA 1 or BRCA 2, it goes up to 40 to 60 percent.", "So knowing a patient's BRCA status is

medication, will reduce that patient's risk of breast cancer by 50 percent [page 9].", "Ovarian cancer risk can be modified as well.", "Something as simple as a patient taking birth control pills can

to 60-year-old age range.", "That can reduce risks dramatically.", "We know we can further reduce a woman's risk of breast cancer by removing her ovaries and fallopian tubes, usually recommended at age 35 to 40; and we know we can reduce the risk of an ovarian cancer developing by removing a patient's ovaries and fallopian tubes.", "Usually this is discussed with 35- to 40-year-olds.", "Let me

attention.", "They work together to attempt to repair the mistake that happens during cell replication\u2014that DNA double-stranded break.", "If everything works well, the repair works fine, and we are back to a normal state.", "Any time there is a mutation in any one of the genes you see here, mistakes are not corrected as easily; they can accumulate, and cancers can occur.", "When we talk about genetic testing, although we are focusing today on BRCA 1 and BRCA 2, we need to also consider all these other genes that are potentially related to the inability of DNA repair and the development of cancer.", "Again, what is the process here?", "We use a sequencing tool.", "Remember, of the 3 billion base pairs of DNA, when we look at the DNA and judge whether there are mutations, we sequence that DNA [page 12].", "The cost of sequencing the whole human genome 20 years ago was $100 million up to $300 million, and those numbers come out of the Human Genome Project.", "I am anticipating that within the next two years, we will be able to DNA sequence a whole human genome, clinically use that information for less than $500.", "It is going to create some rather dramatic changes in our ability to identify patients at risk\u2014not Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 23, 2021 just for cancer, but for cardiovascular disease, developmental delay in children, birth defects, and many other conditions as well.", "It is all because these sequencing tools have become much more powerful and much less expensive.", "Chair Nguyen: Senator Gansert, do you have any other presenters?", "Senator Seevers Gansert: I wanted to thank Dr. Slotnick for going over that with us.", "There are two numbers I want you to remember from that presentation: 87 and 44.",

eight days out and I am definitely still not myself, but I am really glad, especially after hearing Dr. Slotnick's presentation, that I had the chance to do that.", "Even being a cancer survivor, I

one.", "I had a friend whom I knew for 25 years.", "I never knew her without cancer.", "I met her when our daughters were in first grade.", "She died last year of breast cancer.", "More recently she was tested, so this connecting the dots\u2014that you could be BRCA 1 or 2\u2014is not always being connected, to make sure they get testing.", "Well, she tested within the last five years and she tested positive for BRCA.", "While she ended up dying, what was so significant about her testing and getting tested was that her daughters needed to be tested.", "Also, one time when she was fighting breast cancer, her sister was also fighting breast cancer.", "In the end, there are six cousins between the two mothers, and all of them are positive for BRCA.", "One who is 32 years old has already had a bilateral mastectomy because that was the choice she made when she conferred with her physician.", "Women need to get tested so they know their risk, and then their daughters and potentially their sons need to get tested.", "The male breast cancer risk is lower\u2014about 7 percent\u2014but that is significant as well.", "Women who test positive for this gene and connecting those dots is so important.", "The test is really easy and inexpensive and sometimes it is free.", "Thank you for your attention today.", "Chair Nguyen: Thank you, Senator, and thank you, Ms. Whitaker, for sharing your story and being here.", "I forget how accessible we are this session under these protocols that allow someone to come here, share their story, and make a real impact, considering your circumstances.", "I do appreciate that.", "We have a couple of questions from Committee members.", "Assemblyman Orentlicher: Thank you, Senator Gansert, for bringing this bill.", "I very much like it.", "One of the reasons you are proposing this is because it is a recommended screening by the United States Preventive Services Task Force, which makes me wonder: should we be thinking about broadening this?", "Are there other recommendations by the Task Force that we should be making sure doctors follow when they see patients?", "Senator Seevers Gansert: Right now, we are focused on BRCA 1 and 2 because there are probably other ones out there.", "What is helpful for these is that they are covered by insurance.", "We wanted to make sure we Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 23, 2021 at least addressed these two mutations because of the research that has been done and the obvious numbers.", "When Dr. Slotnick and I first talked, he was interested in a lot of different mutations that could potentially be evaluated, but since these are the ones before us, we are focusing on these.", "There may be legislation brought forward in the future that would cover more.", "Assemblyman Orentlicher: In section 1, subsection 3, on page 3, lines 24 to 26, you talk about sanctions for failure to comply.", "There are no criminal penalties, which makes sense, and no professional discipline, so I assume you are leaving open the possibility of a malpractice lawsuit for failure to comply.", "Is that correct?", "It seems odd that you could be sued for malpractice and held accountable but no follow-up for professional discipline.", "Senator Seevers Gansert: Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 457 is the Nevada chapter on cancer.", "In that chapter, if you do not follow everything in there\u2014and there are a variety of things including child support payments\u2014you can have a misdemeanor or felony.", "What I was trying to do was make sure that physicians or primary care providers were providing these assessments, but not penalize them with a misdemeanor or felony.", "They are already doing some family history, but this is more because you have to ask about grandparents, aunts, uncles, and so forth.", "I did not contemplate anything about malpractice insurance.", "This is about trying to get women assessed and taking the first step to see if they need to get genetic testing.", "Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: I appreciate the conversation about this.", "During the past decade, it has been so interesting to watch how our legislation has responded to advances in medical care\u2014starting off with requiring mammograms and talking a couple of years later about dense breast tissue.", "We have had hearty debates in this Committee about how we respond to the new sciences coming out and then being here with the BRCA testing.", "That is just an observation about the evolution of our statutes to respond in medicine.", "Sometimes we cannot keep up with all the good things that are out there.", "For the record, so we can flesh out the continuing education piece, typically, and what I imagine you would want, is that once enacted, the licensing boards would set the number of hours of continuing medical education required.", "That is typically how it works if the class you attend is three hours long, it would be worth three hours of credits.", "The typical model.", "I do not see any hours prescribed in here, so I assume the intent is for the licensing boards to promulgate regulations as they ordinarily would in regard to the amount of credits for the hours spent in that educational activity.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 23, 2021 Senator Seevers Gansert: I wanted to make sure, if you take courses on genetics, that they qualified and were acceptable to whichever organization was your licensing agency.", "I was not requiring a certain number of hours in genetics.", "We wanted to make sure that if you took classes in genetics that had been qualified\u2014usually by a national organization\u2014that they would be acceptable toward the CMEs [continuing medical education].", "Responding to your first comment, you and I know what a heavy lift some of those were\u2014making sure mammograms were covered and prostate screens, and so forth.", "As a result, I am really happy to bring this forward, especially because it is already covered at the federal level.", "It used to be very difficult to have some of these things that really save money in the long term.", "Preventive health services are truly important, so thank you.", "Chair Nguyen: Are there any other questions?", "[There were none.]", "At this time, we will begin testimony in support, opposition, and neutral.", "There is no one in person, so we will go to the lines for callers in support of S.B.", "251 (R1).", "Connor Cain, representing Comprehensive Cancer Centers of Nevada: We encourage your support of this important bill.", "Tess Opferman, representing Nevada Women's Lobby: We want to thank Senator Seevers Gansert for her hard work on this bill.", "Here are some numbers to do with the BRCA mutation: About 13 percent of women in the general population will develop breast cancer sometime in their life.", "By contrast, 55 to 72 percent of women who inherit the harmful BRCA 1 variant and 45 to 69 percent of women who inherit the harmful BRCA 2 variant will develop breast cancer.", "For ovarian cancer, it is also significantly higher for those who have the BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 gene mutations.", "These numbers are significant.", "Ensuring that women are screened and those who are at risk have the ability to get genetic testing is critical to preventive care.", "This bill will, quite literally, save lives.", "We urge your support and thank you for your time today.", "Wesley Falconer, Chief Operating Officer, Cancer Care Specialists, Reno, Nevada: We would like to express the utmost support for this bill, and we believe preventive screening is the way to go with all cancer treatments going forward.", "[The following testimony in support was taken later in the meeting and reclassified here as requested by Chair Nguyen.]", "Sowjanya Reganti, M.D., Private Citizen, Reno, Nevada: I am a medical oncologist at Cancer Care Specialists.", "I would like to totally support this bill and say \"thank you\" to Senator Gansert for bringing it up because it is very important for prevention when there is a family history.", "[Exhibit D in support was submitted but not discussed

(R1)?", "Erin Lynch, Chief, Medical Programs Unit, Division of Health Care Financing and Policy, Department of Health and Human Services: The Division is testifying in neutral on S.B.", "251 (R1).", "Within Nevada Medicaid, we already cover BRCA 1 and 2 screening, testing, and genetic counseling for women who meet the criteria of the bill in the United States Preventive Services Task Force.", "Therefore, we have a zero-dollar fiscal note on this bill.", "Chair Nguyen: Madam secretary, please reclassify the testimony from Dr. Reganti into support testimony.", "Is there anyone else on the line?", "[There was no one.]", "Senator, I will turn this over to you for any closing remarks.", "Senator Seevers Gansert: Thank you, Madam Chair, and members of the Committee.", "I also want to thank Dr. Reganti.", "She was seeing patients and was texting me that she was delayed.", "I also want to thank Erin Lynch who testified that there was a zero-dollar fiscal note.", "This will increase awareness and help connect the dots so women who have the indications that they need to get counseling and testing will get it.", "The numbers are astronomical as far as your odds of getting breast and ovarian cancer and other cancers, and that is why it is so important for a woman and her family.", "I appreciate the time today, and I would appreciate your support for the bill.", "Chair Nguyen: At this time, I will close the hearing on Senate Bill 251 (1st Reprint) and open the hearing on Senate Bill 156 (1st Reprint).", "Senate Bill 156 (1st Reprint): Revises provisions relating to crisis stabilization centers.", "(BDR 40-488) Senator Julia Ratti, Senate District No.", "13: Senate Bill 156 (1st Reprint) is one component of several I will bring forward to you over the course of the remaining portion of the session that seek to address basically rebuilding the way we respond to a person who is experiencing a behavioral health crisis.", "I have a four-minute video I would like to show you which is an overview of how we could look at behavioral health crises [page 1, Exhibit F].", "I was fortunate enough to be part of a group working during the interim through the Legislative Committee on Health Care that participated with a group of folks who made a field trip to Maricopa County to check out the Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 23, 2021 work being done in Arizona to change the system.", "Arizona was one of the earliest adopters trying to look at how we respond to crisis differently.", "Since then, several other states have adopted this approach to crisis intervention.", "I was astounded at the difference they have been able to make there in terms of outcomes for people who are experiencing behavioral health crises.", "Certainly, in the year this nation has experienced, and with the results of the George Floyd trial we are all grappling with this week, I think there has been a growing understanding in our nation that law enforcement is not the appropriate tool for crisis response.", "For too long, we have not built an appropriate crisis response system based more on using behavioral health professionals and peers with lived experience.", "Instead, whenever we have a person who is in crisis, someone calls 911.", "That operator on the other end says, \"Police, fire, or health emergency?\"", "If it is interpreted as being police or health, we are going to roll a law enforcement officer and an ambulance, neither of which is actually the appropriate tool in most behavioral health crises.", "This model is continuing to evolve into how we roll the right resource in the very beginning.", "Today's bill deals with the third part of the model, which is the crisis stabilization centers.", "That is a critical part of the model in terms of when someone is in a crisis and being able to divert them either from the jail system or emergency rooms (ERs).", "I will be bringing a couple of other bills forward to you that will deal with the crisis call point of care, which is really the triage that will make sure the right resources are getting out, and another bill that will talk about licensing of the peer professionals\u2014those people with lived experiences who would be part of that response in many cases, instead of law enforcement.", "Now I will focus more on the system of care so you understand where this fits in, and then I will talk about the specifics of this bill.", "Based on the Crisis Now model, the first step is that high-tech crisis call center.", "In Nevada, we have Crisis Support Services of Nevada, a statewide, national suicide hotline.", "That is a huge asset for us as a starting point.", "These are the four components: the call center; the 24/7 mobile crisis teams; the crisis stabilization centers; and the underlying set of essential principles and practices that are critically important [page 2, Exhibit F].", "If we look at the high-tech crisis call centers, these crisis call centers have behavioral health specialists who can do both the de-escalation of a crisis on a phone line as well as some follow-up case management and care [page 3].", "So we have helped the person de-escalate and then we are making sure they are connected to whatever follow-up resources they may need.", "That is the first important step.", "In research from where this model is operational in other communities, 90 percent of calls concerning someone in a crisis can be stabilized over the phone and can be responsibly triaged for follow-up care.", "What is important for this model is that the crisis call center is high-tech.", "Because of that, there is a system in the background where they communicate with all the care facilities.", "They know where there are outpatient appointments, where medication can be accessed, and where there are beds that can be accessed.", "If that person does need care, they can be immediately placed into that system of care.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 23, 2021 The next part is 24/7 mobile crisis teams [page 4].", "We have done some work in the state to set up mobile crisis teams.", "In the 2019 Session, we created CCBHCs, which are certified community-based behavioral health centers.", "One requirement of those is to have a mobile crisis team.", "So we have taken some steps forward, and there is additional work happening now concerning how we make sure there is a good Medicaid model to reimburse these crisis teams.", "There is some work coming on the national level on more support for mobile crisis teams.", "We have taken care of the 90 percent, but now there is the 10 percent who cannot be stabilized over the phone.", "That high-tech, high-touch call center can dispatch a mobile crisis team.", "That mobile crisis team is a behavioral health professional\u2014a licensed social worker, psychologist, psychiatrist, APRN [advanced practice registered nurse] with a psychiatrist endorsement\u2014and a peer with lived experience\u2014someone who is in recovery from a behavioral health disorder or substance use disorder and can relate to that person in a very different way sometimes than a differently situated behavioral health professional can.", "In this case, this is where you start to see the alleviation of rolling law enforcement at all or rolling an ambulance at all.", "If there is not a medical emergency and there is not a safety issue, but you have an individual in crisis, this is the appropriate team to deal with that crisis.", "That brings us to the point of this bill\u2014the crisis stabilization centers [page 5, Exhibit F].", "There is a small portion\u2014about 1 to 2 percent\u2014who cannot be stabilized by either the phone or the crisis team, and they need to go to a facility.", "As the video indicated, in our current model they end up in one of two places.", "They either end up in the jail because the behavior associated with their mental health crisis is perceived to be violent or they are harming someone, or they end up in the emergency room so they do not harm themselves.", "In either case, they typically end up in some sort of isolation where there is a great period of time during which they are getting no contact from anybody except for being checked for vitals and making sure they stay alive.", "In this model, they go to something known more as a \"living room model.\"", "These are short-term, subacute care for these individuals.", "In this living room model, there are recliners and chairs and tables set up for conversation.", "The staffing is behavioral health professionals and peers with lived experience.", "So the exact opposite happens because there is as much engagement as can possibly be done in 23 hours and 59 minutes.", "That 23 hours and 59 minutes is important because once you get past one day, it flips the patient into \"other licensed facilities,\" so if someone needs more than 23 hours and 59 minutes of care, that person can be leveled up to an actual inpatient center.", "At that point, it is appropriate for them to go into an inpatient setting.", "If they can be stabilized and leveled down, they can be discharged with an appropriate case management plan so they are connected to ongoing outpatient services and medication\u2014whatever their needs are for them to stay stable.", "In the 2019 Session we passed legislation to create these crisis stabilization centers, but we did not get it quite right.", "Senate Bill 156 (1st Reprint) seeks to get crisis stabilization right, and that is why I am here with you today.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 23, 2021 I want to touch on essential crisis care principles [page 6].", "Whether you are talking about the call line, the mobile outreach team, or the crisis stabilization, these principles are very important: \u2022 That it has a recovery orientation.", "The idea going in is that people have the ability to recover.", "\u2022 That it is trauma-informed.", "For many folks experiencing a behavioral health crisis or substance use disorder, part of the reason is that they have experienced some sort of trauma in the past.", "\u2022 That it has a significant use of peer staff\u2014people with lived experience who look like, talk like, and have something in common with the folks they are helping.", "\u2022 A commitment to zero suicide and suicide safer care principles\u2014something the Health and Human Services Committees have talked about a lot.", "\u2022 Strong commitments to safety, of course.", "\u2022 Collaboration with law enforcement, so when that call comes in\u2014it might come in to 911, it might come in to a new phone number we are developing, but if those two systems are not talking with each other, and law enforcement on the street is not aware of and collaborating closely with this parallel system, then it does not work.", "We are very fortunate in the state of Nevada that we have created something called MOST [mobile outreach safety team] teams which is a social worker riding along with law enforcement.", "They will be the critical connection between these two systems, along with the triage that has to happen at the phone-call level to make sure folks get into the right place.", "That is the system.", "So again, S.B.", "156 (R1) focuses on the third aspect of the system, the crisis stabilization centers and making sure we get the licensing correct.", "The reason it is important that we get the licensing correct is, if we get the licensing correct, then these facilities will be more eligible for Medicaid billing, and Medicaid dollars will be able to flow through to create the business model that allows these to be successful.", "As these crisis stabilization centers were originally set up, we imagined them to be psychiatric hospitals, but that was a very narrow group of facilities that could actually step up and serve in that role, so the whole purpose of this bill is to broaden the number of facilities.", "As long as they meet the licensing criteria, they could step up and fill the role of crisis stabilization centers.", "I very much appreciate the indulgence of the Committee to allow me to take you through the entire crisis care model because I am hoping I will be coming back before you with the other pieces of it; but today, it is a relatively simple bill on the licensing of the stabilization centers.", "Chair Nguyen: Thank you for your presentation.", "Do we have any questions from Committee members?", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 23, 2021 Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: This issue is of utmost concern.", "My district includes many of the community groups that serve people who are homeless, and many who have mental illness come to our community for assistance.", "Do you see these mobile response units replacing the MOST teams?", "Mobile outreach safety teams almost always include a police officer.", "I have not asked for any data, but I am not sure how that is being received or their success rates.", "If you have any information about that, I would love to know.", "Senator Ratti: The MOST teams were funded by the state, but then pushed out to the local level, so to get data about effectiveness or impact, we would need to have the folks from Clark County and Washoe County talk about that.", "In Washoe County in my role\u2014I work with and am familiar with the MOST teams there\u2014and the answer is no.", "I do not see the mobile outreach teams replacing the MOST teams, and here is why.", "For some people who are experiencing a behavioral health crisis, there is a true public safety issue.", "It would be inappropriate to roll a peer and a behavioral health professional into that situation.", "You can imagine issues around domestic violence; you can imagine issues where someone is further along the suicide ideation process and is getting close to actually using a weapon to fulfill their own suicide.", "I am sure, if I had a MOST team social worker here, they could talk to you about the wide variety of reasons why there are certain calls they would not want to roll on without law enforcement.", "The way it would need to work is at that first level when the calls are coming in, that triage is critically important and that the right questions get answered.", "Nine-one-one systems are already pretty brilliant at this.", "They have very detailed \"if this, then what\" processes and systems to figure out what is the right resource to roll and to give the folks who are rolling the most information possible.", "As they are going through that triage system, if this appears to be a behavioral health case that does not have a public safety issue, then it should go over to a different system and the suicide hotline system.", "If it still has a public safety issue, we should still be rolling law enforcement.", "In the best-case scenario, that is a MOST team that includes a social worker.", "Then you have the benefit of a social worker and law enforcement in those public safety scenarios.", "The other piece that has happened in Washoe County that I think is incredibly important is that, for these officers who are rolling with social workers, it is an on-the-job training that is irreplaceable and priceless because they get to see how the social worker is interacting with the person they have come upon in this crisis, as opposed to how law enforcement would interact.", "While I think it would be very difficult to quantify, I think we have seen tremendous benefit in Washoe County in terms of how law enforcement is starting to approach behavioral health crises when they are paired with a social worker and what they are learning from that.", "So for the public health reason and for the training\u2014because law enforcement is going to be the response for some of these calls\u2014I think we want to have MOST and we would want to have triage and know when we have to roll MOST and when we have to roll behavioral health crisis teams.", "Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services April 23, 2021 Chair Nguyen: Do we have any other questions from Committee members?", "Seeing none, we will begin testimony in support, opposition, and neutral on S.B.", "156 (R1).", "Joan Hall, President, Nevada Rural Hospital Partners: We are here today and very supportive of S.B.", "156 (R1).", "We are very appreciative of Senator Ratti for working on language to allow rural hospitals to be involved

helped alleviate overcrowding in our ERs and jails; and the best thing of all is that these patients actually get the appropriate treatment they need through the Mallory Center rather than languishing in ER beds or the jails without treatment.", "Over the last several years, hospital representatives from Clark and Washoe Counties have talked to Carson Tahoe's behavioral health department regarding whether their own hospitals could open a similar crisis center.", "However, when it became known that Medicaid only paid observation or office visit rates for these crisis services, the other hospitals lost interest.", "We believe S.B.", "156 (R1) will incentivize other hospitals to open their own crisis stabilization centers.", "It is a critical piece of access to care that is missing in

drop-offs.", "Data suggest that a high proportion of people in crisis who are evaluated for hospitalization, LOCUS [Level of Care Utilization System] levels V and VI, can be safely cared for in a crisis facility, and that the outcomes for these individuals are at least as good as hospital care, while the cost of crisis care is substantially less than the cost of inpatient care and accompanying

expressed on the record today, the bill would need to be amended to reflect that intent.", "SENATOR KIECKHEFER: Just because we say a health insurance plan needs to have premiums that are 15 percent less, that does not reduce costs by 15 percent.", "It may actually increase costs and utilization, and there are a lot of different factors that could happen downstream.", "Who is going to pick up that cost?", "SENATOR CANNIZZARO: We are talking about getting individuals who cannot afford or are ineligible for health insurance.", "There are costs for uninsured, uncompensated care.", "It is more

enrolled.", "If we make a plan 5 percent more affordable than the second lowest silver plan, but people have made the choice not to enroll even though they are eligible on the Exchange now, I am not convinced that will trigger them to sign up.", "I am concerned about where the cost shifts are going to happen to make up for some of this artificial pressure, and I think it is into large-group

156 builds off significant work done in the State, taking a look at how Nevada can modernize our response to a person experiencing a behavioral health crisis.", "I will share a video about responses to a mental health crisis.", "I am excited to bring forward a group of bills that will help the State of Nevada take steps to rebuild our crisis response system and address the needs of a person in a behavioral health crisis.", "As the video alluded, a person will call 911 and the operator will dispatch police, fire or medical personnel.", "For many families or an individual experiencing a behavioral health crisis, the person calling does not fit into one of these categories.", "Starting with work done in Maricopa County in Arizona and in other states across the Nation such Colorado and Oregon, we have begun to adopt and build a specific system designed to address behavioral health.", "This has significant overlap between the criminal and social justice reform work we have been tackling as a State, as well as the appropriate behavioral health response.", "When we roll law enforcement to every, or many behavioral health crises, the person may need a behavioral health professional or peer specifically trained to help.", "We are asking police to do what they were never designed to do.", "Rather than continuing down this path, we seek to partner with and train law enforcement, building an appropriate behavioral health response that partners with law enforcement but whenever possible does not include law enforcement.", "For many people experiencing a behavioral health crisis, interaction with law enforcement can often be retraumatizing.", "It is a significant shift in how we think about responding to a behavioral health crisis with four critical elements I will review on the following presentation (Exhibit F).", "Senate Committee on Health and Human Services March 2, 2021 The model built in Phoenix, Arizona, was picked up by Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration at the national level and is now being distributed as a national best practice.", "That model has four critical components, the first being a High Tech Crisis Call Center.", "I will bring forward another bill sponsored by the Health and Human Services Committee that will specifically talk about the work happening around 988, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline, and centralizing behavioral health crises into a separate system with this High Tech Crisis Call Center.", "Ninety percent of those experiencing a behavioral health crisis in the best practice models are able to be stabilized over the phone through these call centers.", "The centers have specialists who do air traffic control and are critically important as they know where there may be a mobile crisis team and where a bed may be available in an outpatient treatment program.", "We immediately lean into the case management necessary to support that person in the immediate crisis and with any follow-up care.", "Next is the 24/7 Mobile Crisis unit for the 10 percent of callers who cannot be stabilized over the phone.", "These teams typically are comprised of a behavioral health specialist and a peer.", "This is why, to the prior bill S.B.", "69, we are spending the time and attention necessary to ensure we are developing our peer workforce since this model is highly dependent on having those peers as part of the response.", "Someone with lived experience along with a behavioral health professional can be dispatched by the air traffic control system to meet people in the hospital emergency room, on a street corner or in the family\u2019s home or wherever necessary to help stabilize that crisis.", "Senate Bill 156 specifically addresses the crisis stabilization center.", "Last Session, the Washoe County Behavioral Health Policy Board brought forward a bill to do licensing for crisis stabilization centers in an effort to help build this model.", "We learned the language we put together was too narrow by limiting crisis stabilization centers to psychiatric hospitals only, which was not an appropriate approach.", "This bill seeks to expand the number of agencies that can be considered and pursue endorsements to become crisis stabilization centers.", "Along with that would be a model to bill Medicaid for those services so we can build the financial model allowing these crisis stabilization programs to become a reality.", "That is the meat of this particular bill.", "It is important the crisis stabilization and all of the components of the crisis stabilization program have these essential principles and practices.", "These principles include an orientation to recovery, skill Senate Committee on Health and Human Services March 2, 2021 and training in trauma informed care, significant use of peer staff, commitment to zero suicide and suicide safer care principles, safety to consumer and staff, and collaboration with law enforcement so these components get woven through the entire system of care.", "In Phoenix, it took 13 years to build this system.", "We hope to accelerate that; however, there has been a solid two years of ground work laid by Leadership and the Department of Health and Human Services working with the regional behavioral health policy boards.", "I was invited to Phoenix to see their program in practice which sold me on the fact this is the direction we need to move as a State.", "The best outcomes will be for patients getting better immediate care and more positive behavioral health crisis response.", "Long-term savings could potentially benefit both local governments and the State.", "This would give the ability to redirect the significant amount of resources law enforcement agencies are spending now toward behavioral health crises back toward public safety and keeping people out of local hospital rooms, which is not good for the patient or our budget.", "DUANE YOUNG (Deputy Administrator,

removal of the 16-bed requirement would assist in allowing current psychiatric facilities to overcome the burden of creating a hospital within a hospital.", "Expanding this to acute hospitals will allow them to be endorsed and reimbursed, providing a higher standard of care to individuals already presenting in an emergency room, and these cases would be triaged to the most appropriate level of care.", "The Division of Health Care Financing and Policy (DHCFP) met with multiple facilities and hospitals willing to participate in models such as Crisis Now and EmPath if these restrictions are removed, allowing for greater flexibility and a reimbursement mechanism for Medicaid higher than the observation codes.", "This would allow facilities to provide higher standards of care and recruit

appropriate services.", "The living room model is a completely different paradigm.", "We are talking about a large room enabling people to be actively engaged and one of the reasons the infusion of peers is vitally important.", "We work with individuals where they are in relation to their crisis, actively engaging them in problem solving and de-escalation.", "We recognize the need for safety if an individual needs additional support or access to a bed and see this as one of the reasons hospitals need to be able to do this.", "Living room models are considered warm and welcoming.", "There are no staff behind plexiglass windows.", "The models are designed to invite individuals to engage with treatment providers and peers in meaningful interactions.", "SENATOR RATTI: An important concept of this is a subacute model and is traditionally meant to last 24 hours or less.", "If people cannot be stabilized in that period of time, the next step would be to put them in an appropriate level of care in an inpatient facility.", "If they can be stabilized, it ensures they are discharged with a good case management plan, with outpatient care and appropriate medications.", "SENATOR KIECKHEFER: Do you anticipate some of these programs would be built within our existing acute care facilities?", "MR. YOUNG: With the 16-bed requirement, it was not advantageous for hospitals and psychiatric facilities because it is expensive to run a separate 16-bed facility.", "Striking the language as it is in the bill and allowing acute hospitals would provide a separate area within the hospital without restraints from the bed Senate Committee on Health and Human Services March 2, 2021 count, which would be more flexible for staffing.", "It would be an area within the hospital.", "Both the EmPath model and Crisis Now look at separate areas that are more comfortable and conducive to an environment of recovery within the facility.", "Someone would be moved out the emergency room into this area, triaged appropriately within the first 24 hours, and given an appropriate level of care or plan of safe discharge to return home.", "SENATOR KIECKHEFER: If someone is on a Legal 2000 hold, is that person eligible for placement in a crisis stabilization center?", "MS. WOODARD: It is possible.", "We would expect that a number of individuals presenting for care in a crisis stabilization unit or center would already be initiated on a Legal 2000 hold.", "We have found the vast majority of individuals coming in on legal holds do not meet criteria where this is in place.", "A thorough evaluation can determine if an individual does meet criteria for a legal hold, and the center staff can do the transfer of care whether in their hospital or a hospital within their region, ensuring the individual is placed most appropriately depending upon the need.", "SENATOR KIECKHEFER: Are there security requirements around withholding someone under legal custody?", "MS. WOODARD: This is one of the reasons we want our crisis stabilization units or centers to be in existing hospitals.", "They must meet a number of safety and security measures, including antiligature for the ability to do seclusion and restraint if necessary.", "In hospitals or crisis stabilization centers that have used this model, the need for seclusion and restraint is very little.", "Much of this has to do with not only the philosophy behind the care provided, but the way the staff are trained to engage with individuals in crisis.", "SENATOR RATTI: The important piece to making this successful is the ability to say yes to everyone.", "Whether it is a Legal 2000 hold, a substance use withdrawal issue or any other type of mental health issue, if law enforcement or a mobile crisis team has brought these individuals to the door, the idea is that it is a very quick turnaround.", "This lets law enforcement get back to their job, and the crisis Senate Committee on Health and Human Services March 2, 2021 stabilization center is set up to address any concern.", "Over time, you can train law enforcement to say yes.", "Other communities have learned you cannot say yes to everyone so individuals are not taken to these crisis stabilization centers.", "When we start making that decision, we lose the efficacy of the program.", "They have the capabilities built in and therefore a higher reimbursement rate.", "Communities have also found they are spending less money on individuals than those sitting in an emergency room.", "SENATOR KIECKHEFER: We are talking about allowing places such as the Mallory Behavioral Health Crisis Center in Carson City to be built within the walls of a larger hospital, is that correct?", "SENATOR RATTI: It could be built within in the walls of a larger hospital but would not have to be, as long as a center can meet the licensing criteria.", "MR. YOUNG: The Mallory Behavioral Health Crisis Center is one of the reasons we asked to bring forth this type of legislation because it did not fit in the existing language.", "This would allow a center to receive the Medicaid reimbursement.", "SENATOR KIECKHEFER: Is the Mallory Behavioral Health Crisis Center too large, with too many beds?", "MR. YOUNG: No, as it is considered licensed as an acute care hospital, not a free standing psychiatric hospital, it did not qualify.", "The removal of that language will allow a center to qualify to perform these services even though the staff are performing them without a proper reimbursement.", "SENATOR RATTI: The first version of this bill limited it to psychiatric hospitals.", "SENATOR HARDY: How does this affect, for instance, WestCare.", "Is that model still allowed under this bill, or does it need to be a hospital, separate and distinct?", "Senate Committee on Health and Human Services March 2, 2021 SENATOR RATTI: As for WestCare, or what is created in the Nevada Revised Statutes as a crisis triage center, it is not eliminated.", "The crisis triage centers have evolved differently than anyone had anticipated and have perhaps evolved differently in Clark County than they have in Washoe County.", "They do not meet the full need of a robust behavioral health crisis stabilization, so we believe this bill is needed in addition to what is happening in care, treatment and services standards.", "SENATOR HARRIS: Homelessness often co-occurs with a mental disorder.", "Do these stabilization centers need to offer services for those who are homeless and experiencing mental health crises?", "SENATOR RATTI: The experience of other communities has been that individuals experiencing homelessness also experience behavioral health crises.", "If you have a more appropriate behavioral health response, you have a higher likelihood of helping that individual move away from homelessness and into a more stable situation.", "However, not every individual experiencing homelessness coming through a crisis stabilization will get housed.", "Their behavioral health crises will be stabilized.", "Due to the high tech, high touch air traffic control system and ability to connect them back to their case managers and case management programs embedded into the system, there will be a significant effort to attempt to get them housed.", "We cannot guarantee everyone getting a crisis stabilized will be ready and willing to go into housing.", "It does dramatically increase the odds this may happen.", "SENATOR HARRIS: If officers respond, is there any way to be sure they will take individuals to a crisis stabilization center versus jail?", "Someone may be combative and has assaulted an officer and is taken to jail.", "Is there some way to ensure when being picked up by an officer the person will end up at one of these centers?", "SENATOR RATTI: Another bill is coming forward where we can dig a little deeper into your question, which is the 988 National Suicide Prevention Hotline.", "What is important for the crisis stabilization system is there is a strong partnership with law enforcement.", "A big part of that is working with dispatch and ensuring the appropriate dispatch is happening for every situation.", "There will be times when Senate Committee on Health and Human Services March 2, 2021 someone experiencing a behavioral health crisis is putting self or others in such a level of danger a public safety response is appropriate.", "There will be other situations where law enforcement will never be dispatched because there is not a public safety issue.", "I cannot say there is a once-size-fits-all or guarantee.", "Where the model works is when you dispatch the right response for what is happening.", "This is where the learning we need to do with law enforcement, dispatch and behavioral health professionals ensures we are getting the

rooms for inpatient care, many of whom could be and should be better served within other care settings.", "In 2020 alone, we had just under 18,000 visits to emergency rooms by individuals who had a diagnosis of either suicide attempt or ideation.", "We know from some of the mapping done that our rural areas have significant access-to-care issues.", "Because of this limitation, law enforcement is

to go live and have that rolled out by July 16, 2022.", "We anticipate significant growth in the number of calls projected to the 988 line, so we need to prepare our system to answer those calls and do the critical work of connecting those individuals to additional care should it be needed.", "That additional care may be community-based providers, mobile crisis teams or crisis stabilization centers.", "At the federal level, legislation authorizes states to establish a fee, and that fee will be established in a fund.", "That fund should be sequestered to be obligated and expended only in

fee authorized in federal legislation.", "Once the 988 line goes live, call volume will increase.", "Our lifeline is operational now, but if the resources do not keep up with the volume of calls, people will wait to have their calls answered when they are experiencing suicidal ideation.", "That is the worst possible outcome.", "We do not get to choose when it goes live.", "We have the planning grant to which the State is processing data and analysis of how many calls may merit a fee that makes sense.", "Rather than putting a dollar amount on that fee in statute, it is allowed in regulatory process because we do not want to under-shoot or overshoot the law.", "Today\u2019s 911 fees in our State range from $.45 to $1.25 per month.", "This range is because 911 is driven at the county level.", "Counties have different rates they have assessed.", "Other states\u2019 fees have been in the 30-cent range.", "Rather than guessing, the regulatory process would allow for a look at the data to decide what we need and set the fee.", "National campaigns to promote the 988 number will create an influx of calls, so it is important we turn the 988 line on and ensure sure we have the resources to respond to these calls.", "Utah just passed its bill.", "In addition to establishing a rate, the state did a $16 million allocation to do the interoperability work that could get everyone ready for 911 and 988.", "We are not asking for that at this point, but we are asking to not leave the lifeline hanging without the resources it needs once it is live.", "Senate Committee on Health

see the volume and get a better idea the ongoing resource needs?", "SENATOR RATTI: The 988 fee money is less about the stand-up and more about the ongoing operating costs.", "This is more about the first-tier money the Crisis Support Services of Nevada would need to add extra staff to answer additional calls, texts and chats.", "While there could be a large amount of money coming our way, it is not necessarily sustainable ongoing money.", "Analysis based on the $45 million settlement would have come to us.", "Language in that $45 million settlement directs where money should go for the opioid impact, and we would have to make the argument that everything in the crisis response system has that nexus to the opioid impact.", "It is unknown where that allocation will go.", "Dr. Woodard and I have discussed stand-up dollars and the American Rescue Plan.", "In terms of one-shot monies, particularly on interoperability between 911 and 988, I will vote for everything we need to spend

welfare agency to provide safety when executing a warrant.", "They were concerned that the juvenile probation officers in their area do not carry weapons and would not necessarily be in a position to assist with executing a warrant.", "This section says \u201cmay\u201d which gives the court the discretion over who it authorizes to execute the warrant.", "We want to leave the possibility there because it may be appropriate for juvenile probation to assist in some jurisdictions, and in other jurisdictions, it would not be appropriate.", "We feel the language would allow for that flexibility.", "SENATOR KIECKHEFER: Section 1, subsection 1, at the top of page 3 states \u201cbut the threat is not imminent in the time it would take to obtain a warrant.\u201d I interpret that to mean we do not think the child is going to be harmed between now and the judge issuing a warrant.", "Is that correct?", "MS. OKUMA: In a variety of cases, you have to get a warrant unless there is an exigency and the child would be at risk of harm in the time it would take to get a warrant.", "We have left the language as is in that respect because in some jurisdictions a warrant can be obtained very quickly based on the technology they have.", "In other jurisdictions, it can take a bit longer to obtain a warrant.", "While the case law has been around, the process is still somewhat in its infancy as compared to warrants that are obtained in the criminal realm.", "SENATOR KIECKHEFER: Would this language prohibit placing a child in protective custody if they are in immediate jeopardy?", "Senate Committee on Health and Human Services April 22, 2021 MS. OKUMA: Correct.", "We have many circumstances where an exigency exists and the child is in immediate danger and placed in protective custody.", "CHAIR RATTI: In that circumstance, do they get the warrant after the child has been placed in protective custody, or is the warrant mute at that point?", "MS. OKUMA: If there is an exigency, and the child is immediately placed into protective custody, there is no subsequent warrant.", "Whether there is a warrant or not, a hearing must be held within 72 hours, usually in less time than that, and a hearing notice is sent to the parents.", "They are provided counsel, and in most cases, it is before the court with a notice hearing.", "SENATOR SPEARMAN: We have a number of children who are in unsafe conditions because of sex trafficking.", "Would that fall under this, or is this only for children who are in familial situations?", "MS. OKUMA: This would not apply to a child who is a victim of sex trafficking unless the person who is responsible for that child is a parent or other caregiver.", "There are circumstances under NRS 432B that come within that, but other circumstances that do not.", "Chapter 432B only deals with children at risk of abuse or neglect by a parent or other person responsible for their welfare that has a specific definition.", "SENATOR HARDY: If there is a child or parent who knows the child is going to be removed from their home and placed in foster care, and knows they have three or four days before this happens, the child could run away or the entire family could disappear.", "How do you handle that situation?", "MS. OKUMA: Those circumstances do happen but are rare as it relates to the circumstance of a warrant.", "Jurisdictions are obtaining warrants and have been for several years; however, we did not have a mechanism within the statute.", "Once the warrant is obtained by the social worker, they attempt to execute it quickly.", "Sometimes, Senate Committee on Health and Human Services April 22, 2021 between the time of obtaining a warrant and executing it, the family does disappear and they use all of their resources to try to locate the family to execute the warrant.", "In those cases, or the exigent circumstance, there is no notice given to the child before the social worker arrives.", "The same with the parents; the case social worker or law enforcement generally provides the warrant and places the child in protective custody at the time the warrant is served.", "MR.
