I will open the bill hearing on Senate Bill 21 \n(1st Reprint). \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 28, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nSenate  Bill  21  (1st  Reprint):    Revises  requirements  relating  to  background \ninvestigations conducted by certain institutions, agencies and facilities that serve \nchildren. (BDR 5-303) \n \nRoss E. Armstrong, Administrator, Division of Child and Family Services, Department \nof Health and Human Services: \nSenate Bill 21 (1st Reprint) started as a boring, kind of nerdy government administrative bill \nto standardize the crimes that we check in child-serving agencies in terms of background \nchecks for hiring employees who are working with vulnerable populations.  In the Division \nof Child and Family Services (DCFS) within the Department of Health and Human Services, \nwe currently have three different sets of rules about the backgrounds that can either qualify \nor disqualify an individual to work in our agency.  We occasionally get an employee who \nwants to transfer or even promote their career, but they cannot get from one part of the \nagency to the other because of these differing background checks. \n \nThe original Senate Bill 21 set the list of exclusionary crimes across the board and also put \nsome time limits, particularly on minor drug offenses.  We had a lot of folks who had minor \ndrug charges.  It did not matter how old those drug charges were; those people were excluded \nfrom working at the agency.  That is what the original bill did.  Every bill starts as an idea, \nbut then it opens doors to conversations, and you hope you can get to change.  As we worked \nwith stakeholders throughout the process in the other house, it became clear that, when we \nare talking about these child-serving agencies, we are talking about agencies whose whole \nidea of existing is to give folks a second chance—a brighter future ahead of them than what \nthey may be experiencing now and that our employment practices should reflect those core \nvalues of our agencies. \n \nThe bill was amended so that there is consistency in terms of what crimes are checked across \nthe different parts of child-serving agencies, but also giving each one of those agencies the \nability to do a weighing test to determine if somebody does come back with a particular \ncrime on their background and the statute says that they can be excluded, that you could \nreally take a look at each individual situation and weigh the crime, the conduct that occurred, \nwith what their role is going to be and that those exclusionary crimes can be waived so long \nas that objective test is followed.  Anytime we add human discretion, of course, there is \nan opportunity  for  human  bias,  implicit  or  otherwise,  so  also  amended  into  the  bill  is \na requirement that an agency that is using that weighted test periodically checks the results of \nthat test to make sure that there are not biased results in those tests.  We started with just \nmaking sure all the crimes were consistent and we have added this ability for agencies to \nwaive that.  One other factor that helped us move in that direction was that, in working with \nthe families and children, there is inherent value a lot of times in lived experience.  So we \nwere unable to hire folks who, because of their own life experience, can actually really help \nin the rehabilitation or safety of our children.   \n \nTo run through the actual sections of the bill, we are talking about three different types \nof entities:    juvenile  justice  detention  centers  and  facilities,  child  welfare  agencies,  and \nstate-operated mental health facilities for children.  Some of the things we did across the \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 28, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nboard, including the time limit on drug offenses, was to add domestic violence as one of the \ncrimes to check against.  That crime had some existing behaviors into the workplace that \nwere not good; also, in talking with stakeholders, prostitution alone has been removed due to \nthe nature of how that crime is charged. \n \nIn the bill, sections 1 and 2 apply to those juvenile justice agencies; sections 3 and 4 make \nthe  adjustment  to  the  child  welfare  agencies.    The  child  welfare  statute  had  the  most \ncomprehensive list to start with, so that served as the model for the others.  Division-operated \nmental health facilities are in sections 5 and 6, and section 7 gives the bill an implementation \ndate of January 1, 2022.  That would give us sufficient time to implement the weighing test \nand for the Division to provide any technical assistance to those local entities that were trying \nto do the same thing.    \n \nThat is S.B. 21 (R1).  The main goal is to have some consistency in our background approach \nacross  child-serving  agencies  and  also  to  have  an  opportunity  to  take  a  look  at  each \nindividual case to make a determination of whether past criminal conduct still presents \na potential risk to the agencies or the individuals they serve.  With me is Sherri Vondrak, the \nDCFS personnel officer who did a tremendous job in terms of researching what other states \nwere doing and found that Oregon was using this weighted test. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any questions from Committee members? \n \nAssemblywoman Krasner: \nWhat is the current law and how are we changing it? \n \nRoss Armstrong: \nThe current law varies from agency to agency.  For example, the child welfare agencies have \nthe greatest list of exclusionary crimes.  The juvenile justice agencies did not have us check \nfor involuntary manslaughter or require that a felony has use of force or threatened use of \nforce.  In the mental health and juvenile justice statutes, it adds to that list.  The biggest \nchanges are the time limit on drug offenses, the inclusion of checking for domestic violence, \nand the addition of the sex crimes, with the exception of prostitution because we know in \na lot of cases those are instances of coercion—it was charged that way.  The biggest thing is \nthat right now, if any of these crimes pop up, it is an automatic exclusion—there is no \ndiscretion.  So we have had cases where someone was convicted of marijuana in 1982 and \nthey have been great since, and they want to come work with one of our juvenile justice \nfacilities, and we have to say no.  In this case, we could weigh the length of time it has been \nand all those individual factors and actually hire the individual to work at the agency.  The \nway the law works now is that in each of those areas, if one of those crimes pops up, the \nperson is barred from employment.  This would give discretion to the agency to take a closer \nlook at those cases and hire an individual regardless of that particular crime. \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 28, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nAssemblywoman Krasner: \nI appreciate that we want to give people a second chance regarding drug-related offenses.  \nIt is not possible with this bill that someone who was convicted of molesting or raping a child \nwould now work in child welfare services, correct? \n \nRoss Armstrong: \nThat is correct.  I would imagine that all of the agencies that would apply that weighted test \nwould  have  particular  offenses  that,  no  matter  what  the  circumstances,  would  still  be \nprohibited.  In particular, in our juvenile justice agencies, we have to comply with the federal \nPrison Rape Elimination Act, so that would absolutely be a nonstarter for those entities.  \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nI saw in here that there would be a review every two years.  Is that if the person is hired with \nsomething in their background that you are giving them a probationary situation, or is that \nif someone, after being employed, gets into trouble and will be reviewed every two years, \nor is it both? \n \nRoss Armstrong: \nThere are two review periods.  Currently, and this bill does not change a lot, after someone is \nhired by one of these entities, they have to run the background check every five years to \nmake sure no new crimes have popped up.  There is some clarifying language in the statute \nthat talks about what \"pending charges\" is, for that analysis by the agency.  The two-year \nreview is for an agency using the weighted test to waive those exclusionary crimes.  They \nhave to check it every two years to see if the results of that test, not for an individual but \nagency-wide, have any bias or discrepancies.  If two years down the road you are looking at \nthe test and all of the Black applicants were denied using the test and all the white applicants \nwere approved using the test, that would be a huge red flag you would want to address.  \nBecause we are adding that human decision point, we wanted to make sure there was data \ncollection and regular analysis to make sure there was not a human bias seeping into the \nsystem.  The hard line—no discretion—in statute can lead to a structural bias with no way \nout.  We wanted to make sure those entities were regularly taking a look at their practices \nwith an eye toward making sure those areas where there was discretion were not being \nmisused. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nLet us say I am an employee of either juvenile justice, child welfare, or mental health.  After \nI am hired, every five years, you are going to run a background check on me, period.  \nCorrect? \n \nRoss Armstrong: \nCorrect. \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 28, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nIf I am hired with something in my background and you are using a waiver to employ me—\nI smoked pot in 1982 and got convicted but have been a model citizen—and you are going to \nhire me because I can bring something to that agency, you are still going to check me every \nfive years.  Is that correct? \n \nRoss Armstrong: \nCorrect. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nBut the two-year waiver, the two-year review, is to ensure that your agency is, without bias, \napplying the waiver you gave me to everybody evenly. \n \nRoss Armstrong: \nCorrect.   \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nOkay, I understand.  Thank you. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any other questions from Committee members?  Seeing none, is there any \ntestimony in support of S.B. 21 (R1)? \n \nNick  Shepack,  Policy  and  Program  Associate,  American  Civil  Liberties  Union  of \nNevada: \nI want to thank Mr. Armstrong for working so hard with us on this piece of legislation.  \nWe believe that the reprinted version of this bill represents a department that really believes \nin second chances and that can hire the best people to work with kids, especially people with \nmaybe checkered pasts but who have been doing really well.  We think this bill is a great step \nfor the department and we encourage you to support it.  \n \nDaniel Pierrott, representing Fingerprinting Express: \nI am testifying in support of S.B. 21 (R1) on behalf of our client, Fingerprinting Express.  \nFingerprinting Express utilizes the latest technology in fingerprint background checks in \naddition to a myriad of other services to ensure the safety and security of Nevadans.  As it \nstands, there are over 80 industries in Nevada that are required by statute to complete \na fingerprint background check.  While we think that anyone who works with children should \ncomplete  a fingerprint  background  check, this  piece  of  legislation moves  the needle in \ncreating  additional  protections  for  Nevada's  children.    We  would  like  to  conclude  by \nthanking  the  Committee  for  hearing  this  important  piece  of  legislation  and  to \nAdministrator Armstrong for his work on this issue. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 28, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWith no more callers in support, do we have anyone in opposition to S.B. 21 (R1)?  [There \nwas no one.]  Is there anyone in neutral?  [There was no one.]  At this time, I will turn this \nback over to Mr. Armstrong for closing remarks. \n \nRoss Armstrong: \nThank you, Madam Chair, and members of the Committee.  There are a few bills where you \nget more and more excited about the bill as it goes along, and this has been one for us as we \nmade that shift from a nerdy administrative law change to real change in the way we \napproach employing our staff.  I thank you for your time and consideration.  If there are \nquestions as we go forward, please feel free to reach out. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAt this time, I will close the hearing on S.B. 21 (R1) and open the hearing on Senate Bill 143 \n(1st Reprint).     \n \nSenate  Bill  143  (1st  Reprint):   Revises  provisions  relating  to  the  care  of  children. \n(BDR 15-721) \n \nSenator Dallas Harris, Senate District No. 11: \nThank you for taking the time to hear Senate Bill 143 (1st Reprint).  This bill has been \na labor of love.  This bill is sponsored by Assemblywoman Hansen and me.  The basis \nbehind this bill is to codify the idea that parents know their children best and that they should \nallow their kids to go outside and play and engage in what we call \"independent activities\" if \nit is safe to do so.  This by no means says that any parent who thinks their two-year-old is an \nOlympic swimmer and does not need floaties could not be prosecuted for child abuse and \nneglect.  However, it does provide some guidelines, for both the Division of Child and \nFamily Services (DCFS) as well as for parents, to make it clear that if you would like your \nchild to be able to walk to school by themselves or with a group of friends, you could, or that \nyou will not have someone banging on your door simply because you left your kids at home \nwhile you went to the grocery store while they have their cell phones and are able to reach \nyou in multiple ways. \n \nWe know very well that these types of laws are often applied a little bit more harshly toward \nfolks who do not have as much money, folks who do not look like the majority of people in \nthis country, so the second piece of this bill is to try to provide a little bit more equity in that \napplication.  At this time, I would like to invite my cosponsor, Assemblywoman Hansen, to \nthe table to speak a little bit about why she felt it was important for us to team up and bring \nthis bill to you. \n \nAssemblywoman Alexis Hansen, Assembly District No. 32: \nThank  you  for  your  time  and  the  opportunity  to  hear  the  \"reasonable  childhood \nindependence\" bill, and I am honored to be cosponsoring with Senator Harris.  I served in the \ninterim on the Legislative Committee on Child Welfare and Juvenile Justice, and I am very \naware of the serious issues that face our children and families in the state of Nevada.  That is \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 28, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nnot lost on me nor on Senator Harris.  I have appreciated the opportunity we have had to be \nable to talk to many stakeholders and appreciate their input and the amending language that \nhas been submitted. \n \nTo be clear, the intent of this bill is not to make the important work of law enforcement or \nchild protective agencies and prosecutors more difficult.  We appreciate the difficult work \nthey attend to in our state on a regular basis.  We are here today to talk about the other end of \nthe spectrum—responsible parents—and the sometimes unnecessary hindrances or the stigma \nthat they can be caught up in under the broad scope of that Nevada neglect statute.  We hope \nwith this legislation to assure responsible parents that they can use their reasonable judgment \nto determine if their children are capable of independently engaging in certain activities of \nchildhood independence. \n \nMany of you know that Senator Harris and I were raised by single moms.  If they were \nraising us as children today, I worry that our mothers could be caught up in this broad net of \nneglect statute.  My mother's circumstances were such that she allowed me—and sometimes \nhad no other choice—to experience reasonable childhood independence, and I benefitted \nfrom that.  In turn, my eight grown and very successful children are products of growing up \nwith the same kind of confidence I was allowed to develop.  Today, many parents and \nlegislators do not know whether it is allowable by law for their children to engage in these \nindependent activities.  Unfortunately, a culture of fear has begun to grip many parents in our \ncommunities about what is okay or what is neglect in the eyes of the law or even in the eyes \nof their neighbors.  I see this legislation as enabling good parents to be given the autonomy to \nmake  decisions  about  childhood  independence  within  reasonable—and  that  is  the  key \nword—guidelines that are codified in statute.  This is not a solution in search of a problem; \nthe problem already exists.  The parents in our communities today are being stigmatized. \n \nSenator Harris: \nIn the spirit of working with stakeholders, we have gone back and forth on language 50 or so \ntimes.  I want the Committee to be aware that the most recent amendment you have before \nyou will likely be changed one more time.  With your permission, Chair, I would like to read \nthrough what I would like the language to ultimately read in section 1.5, subsection 2. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nPatrick Ashton, our policy analyst, has something to clarify as well. \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \nCommittee members, we just received the amendment from Senator Harris [Exhibit C] and \nI sent it to you by email.  It should be uploaded on the Nevada Electronic Legislative \nInformation System (NELIS) shortly if you want to follow along. \n \nSenator Harris: \nThank you very much.  Ultimately, section 1.5, subsection 2, paragraph (b) will read as \nfollows:  pursuant to NRS 62E.280, the child is alone or with other children outside the direct \nsupervision of the child's parent, guardian, a stepparent with whom the child lives, an adult \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 28, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nperson continually or regularly found in the same household as the child and the child is of \nsufficient maturity, physical condition, and mental ability that indicates that their health or \nwelfare is not harmed or threatened with harm; being alone or with other children outside the \ndirect supervision of the child's parent, guardian, a stepparent with whom the child lives, an \nadult person continually or regularly found in the same household as the child as defined in \nsubsection (c) may include a child engaging in independent activities.  You will see that then \nconnects to DCFS putting forward some regulations to further define what \"independent \nactivities\" are in order to give both courts and those who are out in the field clear direction on \nwhat it actually means for an independent activity to be engaged in, and that connects it with \nthe legislative intent even further, to allow parents to let their children be children. \n \nWe have two folks on the Zoom, Ms. Diane Redleaf, who is the legal consultant with Let \nGrow, and Dr. Rachel Flynn, a child development psychologist.  They are both available to \nanswer the more technical questions the Committee may have. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI am really excited about this bill.  Having two young kids of my own, recognizing their \nmaturity, their responsibility, giving them these kinds of freedom only improves their ability \nto cope, their ability to problem-solve, and gives them confidence.  I think we have questions \nfrom the Committee. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nIn  looking  over  the  amendment,  it  looks  as  though  you  are  working  very  hard  to,  by \nregulation, get intent on concepts.  That can be really hard because we know that other states \nmight put a hard-and-fast age in, but it looks like when we talk about the word \"maturity,\" \nyou are going to want the Division, the Department, to define through regulation what \nmaturity is.  For the direction to the Department on how they might draft it, could you give us \na little bit more for the record about what you would see the intent is around \"maturity\" when \nit is not tied to a chronological age? \n \nSenator Harris: \nYou hit it right on the nose.  The idea of putting in a hard-line age for this type of legislation \nis not appropriate, given that we know there are some eight- or nine-year-olds who are able \nto be at home for 30 minutes, and there are other eight- or nine-year-olds who will set the \nplace  on  fire.    The  maturity  is  really  about  allowing  the  parent  to  make  a  reasonable \nassessment  about  what  their  child's  capabilities  are,  within  the  norms  of  childhood \ndevelopment.  I think it is best that the Department is able to take input from the folks in the \nfield, from people in different regions of the state, and be able to come up with clear \nguidance on what that looks like. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nThat is going to be the sticky wicket, right?  As the bill's sponsors, explain to me how you \nimagine this playing out.  Let us take an apartment complex situated next to a busy street.  \nThere are children playing outside, unsupervised.  Anyone could call saying, I see children \nunsupervised.  That call goes into child welfare; there is a worker who takes that call and has \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 28, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nto figure out how fast we have to get there.  One thing they will usually ask is the age of the \nchildren.  It makes a difference if it is a three-year-old versus an adolescent-looking child.  \nIf they send a social worker, what are the criteria you would want that social worker to \nconsider before a decision would be made concerning whether to take the child into custody \nor take other measures—to determine whether they need to be involved versus not involved? \n \nSenator Harris: \nYou hit on a couple of things I want to point out.  There is nothing in this bill that would \nsuggest folks should not continue to call child protective services.  Relevant citizens who see \nsomething wrong should continue to call, so this bill does not touch on that front-end \nprocess.  I do not expect people to stop calling when they think a child is truly in danger.  \nWe may disagree about that, but there is very little we can do on that end and, for the most \npart, it can be helpful in finding bad situations, correct?   \n \nWhen it comes to the social worker assessing, I will be honest, that is not my expertise; that \nis theirs.  A lot of what we are trying to codify is practice that they are already doing.  They \nare not removing children who are outside playing on their bikes, even if they do have to \nshow up as a matter of protocol.  Frankly, I trust the social workers in the field to make these \ncalls and assessments.  They are well-versed in it.  What you are also looking at though, is \nwhen people are actually charged for criminal abuse and neglect.  That is not often the social \nworker's call on the spot, so we are giving the courts guidance, the parents guidance, and the \nsocial workers as well.  Out of the three, the social workers probably need the least amount \nof it. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI want to make sure we are getting a feel for how this would work.  If the intent is taking \nsome existing practices in which they can document that a child is safe, in which they would \ndocument that there is no harm and they are not going to substantiate a case, then it looks as \nthough what you are trying to do is clear a path where regulations would better say what that \nis, and then those regulations would be the backing for whether an agency decided to take \naction or not.  I guess we may hear this in more testimony in support—instances where \nparents felt their children were safe and they got pulled into the child welfare system.  Maybe \nhearing about some of those will help draw a bit more of a bright line to help us understand \nwhere the system overstepped. \n \nSenator Harris: \nThat is correct.  We want parents to be able to feel that they can do what they do; we want \nsocial workers to also feel like they can do what they are chartered to do.  The key here is to \nensure and make very clear that, if you are solely allowing your child to engage in these \nindependent activities, as will be defined later, you should be left alone. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nPerfect.  And then we will just clarify for the record—and I am sure someone else will—but \neven within our child welfare agencies, they might not all be social workers.  The counties \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 28, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nand  the  state  have  policies  on  social  workers,  but  Clark County  has  a  different  policy \nregarding whether it is a social worker or child welfare worker. \n \nSenator Harris: \nCorrect. \n \nAssemblyman Matthews: \nAs a follow-up to Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson's question, given the flexibility, the \nlack of specificity, are there other states that have something similar in place?  Could that be \nsomething we could look to as a guide—what has been tried, what has worked, what has not \nworked—general lessons to be learned from experiences elsewhere? \n \nSenator Harris: \nI will turn it over to Ms. Redleaf to answer that question.  She is well-versed on the different \nlaws across the states. \n \nDiane Redleaf, Legal Consultant, Let Grow: \n[Diane Redleaf submitted a proposed amendment, Exhibit D, and additional information, \nExhibit E.]  Thank you for that question and thank you for hearing this bill.  My role is to \nmonitor legislation around the country for the group Let Grow.  We have been working this \nyear in four states.  I am pleased to announce that the bill in Oklahoma was sent to the \ngovernor on a reconciliation vote that took place this morning.  There is a similar bill in \nTexas that is on a consent calendar in their senate.  This legislation is modeled on Utah \nlegislation passed in 2018 that sets out independent activities with children having sufficient \nmaturity, physical condition, and mental ability.  All the bills Let Grow has been endorsing, \nsupporting, and working with stakeholders on have that element of supporting independent \nactivities, deferring to reasonable parental judgment.  Nevada, so far, is the only state where \nwe are going to engage in a more detailed rulemaking process; we look forward to providing \nthat sort of guidance.  The other states have it more spelled out in the law what \"independent \nactivities\" are, including walking to school, playing in parks, being alone at home—those \nkinds of activities the laws set forth.  They all have that element of maturity and physical \ncondition, and leave the determination of neglect up to the agency to make, using their \njudgment, using their own standards, and not really changing procedure except to give \nparents that reasonable flexibility to make their own decisions based on their knowing their \nchild best. \n \nAssemblyman Matthews: \nIt may be too broad to get into this afternoon, but I would be curious to delve a little more \ndeeply into what some of the lessons learned have been and what the experiences in other \nstates have shown us.  That is something we can follow up on at another time. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nThank you for bringing this much-needed bill forward.  I say that because I too was a single \nparent raising two children, and at one time I was on active duty in the military.  I am sure \nyou would not have a parent looking at a three-year-old running in the street and think that \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 28, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nchild was mature enough to be alone, but I am wondering why a number was not put in the \nbill.  When I first got to Las Vegas, in order for a child to be alone in a house, I believe the \nage was 12.  I do not know where they got that number, but I do remember it had to be 12.  \nUntil my children reached that point, I had to have a child care provider.  As a single parent \nbringing in one salary, that is difficult, so I was wondering why within this bill the guidance \nis the parent.  I am grateful for that because I think that is the way it should be, but we do \nhave some parents who are not mature enough to believe that a three-year-old running in the \nstreet is not mature. \n \nSenator Harris: \nYou are hitting exactly on why we do not have that age in the law.  I have a general belief \nthat parents know their children best.  Are there parents who misbehave?  Certainly, and \nI believe this bill was designed to walk that line—allow parents to make a decision based \nupon their child's maturity and ability, but also allow parents who leave three-year-olds at \nhome alone to be able to be prosecuted under the language in this bill.  I think we can all \nagree—you are correct—that leaving a three-year-old at home is not appropriate, especially \nfor any sustained period of time.  However, I feel free to admit on the record that I left my \nnine-year-old at home while I went to the grocery store or perhaps picked something up from \nWalmart's curbside.  That is exactly why we do not have that number in there.  You need to \nallow parents to be able to make those decisions.  You need to allow parents to not feel like \nthey cannot step out when they need to go get one or two things if their child is of substantial \nmaturity, especially with the price of child care here in America.  So you are hitting on \nsomething very real that this bill is trying to address. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nThank you, and again, I wish this bill was there when my kids needed it. \n \nAssemblyman Hafen: \nI have to thank you both, Senator Harris and Assemblywoman Hansen, for all the hard work \nyou have put into this bill.  This happens to be my favorite bill of the session.  I think it is one \nof the most important things we can be doing for our children—to let them grow in a manner \nthat is fitting for each parent.  Would you consider this \"free-range\" parenting or \"cage-free\" \nparenting? \n \nSenator Harris: \nI am not sure those are mutually exclusive.  We could call it both. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI know some of the agencies may be planning to testify in support, opposition, or neutral.  \nIf you are from one of those agencies, after you speak, please pause to see if we have any \nquestions.   \n \nSenator Harris: \nWe have Brigid Duffy on Zoom, and she will be giving testimony as well. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 28, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any other questions for our bill presenters at this time? \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nIf the child has to use public transportation, is there a prohibition for that? \n \nSenator Harris: \nNo, there is no prohibition for that.  Although it is not in the list we put down, I do think \nDCFS will have to consider allowing children to ride public transportation—whether that is \nto get to school or to the next activity.  That needs to be considered. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nI think that is really important and that there has to be clarity there.  I am in a district that is \npublic transit-dependent.  Although I have, and always have had, a vehicle, when I was \nsingle parenting, and even afterward, and my kids had school and then baseball, we did the \ntraining—this is where you walk to get on the bus; put your money in; sit next to the driver; \nand then go to baseball.  That really changes how children see themselves and grows their \nconfidence.  Plus, I was able to call the bus company because I worked for them and have \nthem check with the drivers.  Again, this is really important, so please have them consider \nthat. \n \nSenator Harris: \nDefinitely.  Right now in the bill language it says travel to and from school.  It does not have \na limitation on the mode, and that is definitely the intention of this bill—to allow children to \nbe able to engage with the world.  That is how they become functional adults, so learning \nhow to take public transportation is definitely a part of that. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any other questions from Committee members?  I do not see any, so with that, \nwe will begin testimony in support of S.B. 143 (R1). \n \nGillian Block, representing Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers: \nWashoe Legal Services and the Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada represent 100 percent \nof children in the child welfare system.  We support S.B. 143 (R1) because we believe it will \nclarify  the  law  on  child  neglect  and  will  help  prevent  unjustified  interventions  that \ndisproportionately affect low-income families and families of color. \n \nBrigid  J.  Duffy,  Chief  Deputy  District  Attorney,  Juvenile  Division,  Clark  County \nDistrict Attorney's Office: \nToday I am speaking on behalf of the Department of Family Services.  I am testifying in \nsupport.    I  originally  registered  in  opposition  because  we  have  been  working  on  an \namendment, so I want to qualify my testimony, on behalf of the agency, if these amendments \nthat have been presented today by Senator Harris are accepted, then the Department of \nFamily Services in Clark County is supportive of them, and thank you to both sponsors, \nAssemblywoman Hansen and Senator Harris, for working with us so closely. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 28, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nAs far as this legislation goes, when the first week of the session came out, this bill was in \nour queue early on.  We had a meeting with the stakeholders from Let Grow and different \nchild welfare organizations across the state.  What we were told, as child welfare was, \n\"Parents do not know what they are allowed to have their children do.  Parents in Nevada live \nin fear that they cannot leave their children alone.\"  I offered an example of how I understand \nthat maybe we are not clear enough with parents.  We had a case in Clark County:  an eight-\nyear-old successfully killed himself with a firearm in a home.  He was home alone with his \nfive-year-old sister.  It was ruled a suicide by the coroner.  I got a lot of calls from the press \nasking how this eight-year-old could be home alone and was that not illegal.  How old do \nthey have to be to be home alone?  The answer to the press was that it is not an age-based \ndecision; it is a maturity level; it is a developmental level; it is a physical condition level.  \nSo it  was  easy  for  us  as  stakeholders  from  the  district  attorney's  office,  to  the  public \ndefenders, to legally say, let us make it clear in statute so parents do understand that a child \ncan be alone or outside direct supervision of a parent or someone responsible for their \nwelfare, if they are of sufficient maturity and physical condition and mental ability.  That \nindicates that they are not threatened with harm or would be harmed.  We want to make it \nclear for parents in the state of Nevada.  \n \nThe issue of the independent activity that the stakeholders and the lobbying groups use—for \nus, alone is alone.  When a call comes into the hotline, we do not have a lot of removals in \nour county based upon lack of supervision unless it is really young children found wandering \nin the streets in August in diapers without shoes on.  Think about that.  When a call comes in, \nit is different from an apartment complex where a five-year-old is on the swing set and \na neighbor is calling in.  If it is April and the child is wearing a sweatshirt, the weather is \nfine, they are on the swings doing a childhood activity and no one can see an adult around, \nthat is not necessarily going to rush child protective services out there.  If it is August, the \nchild is three years old and does not have shoes on and the playground is hot and there is no \none there, that may amp the situation up a little, as well as children around pools.  We have to \nbe very careful when we have young children around pools without adult supervision. \n \nAlso, to address Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong's issue around public transportation, \nI grew up in Philadelphia, and we were taking the subway at a very young age because that is \nhow we got everywhere.  Just to be clear, child protective services does not go in and remove \nchildren from public transportation.  It is a mode of transportation that children use to get to \nand from school.  Again, it is based on the maturity, physical condition, and mental ability of \nthe child.  We could not just put an age into statute because a 12-year-old may not have the \nmental ability of a 12-year-old.  We have many 12-year-olds who have the mental ability of a \n3- or 4-year-old due to developmental delays, so it is better to do these general criteria that \nwill then be screened by the child protective service hotline.  \n \nWe hope that by working with the sponsors we allowed our concerns as the people who \npractice day-in and day-out in the child welfare agencies, courtrooms, and in the field, that \nalone is alone and it is okay, and a parent can be clear, as long as their child is of sufficient \nmaturity, physical condition, and mental ability, that would indicate that they are not harmed \nor threatened with harm.  Like the organization Let Grow came in wanting to let parents, and \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 28, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nencourage parents, to allow their children to get out and get some independence and do some \nactivities, that is also captured in this amendment as a balance for both us and them.  Again, \nthank you to the Senator and Assemblywoman for working with us.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nMs. Duffy, we do have some questions for you. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nOnce again, this is for the record because we will be having the state department promulgate \nthese regulations.  This is the same question I had for Senator Harris.  When we talk about \nthe concept of maturity, what would you want on the record to help indicate to folks who are \ngoing to be writing those regulations what you would hope to see encapsulated in that \nconcept of maturity?  What would help that bright line?  If we are not listing ages, we are \ngoing to be listing characteristics.  I want to make sure we do not get into a circular reference \nwhere we have regulation that ends up being as muddy as status quo.   \n \nBrigid Duffy: \nThat is absolutely right.  We are basically going to be looking at situations.  Take my \nexample of the eight-year-old who, sadly, took his life.  The five-year-old sister was mature \nenough to know, and she was the one who went next door to the neighbor.  The parent had a \nwindow of approximately 45 minutes between her working and the stepfather working, so \nthere were 45 minutes where the children would be home alone.  They had a plan with the \nchildren that involved the neighbors who knew the children were home alone.  In fact, that \nfive-year-old knew to implement that plan as she was in the room with her brother who was \ndying.  That five-year-old was at a maturity level—even in a crisis situation—so it is really \nabout reasonable parenting.  I am sure when Senator Harris went to Walmart to pick up \nthings that her nine-year-old knew who to call if there was an emergency in that 15 minutes \nshe may have been out of the house.  It is really those situational things. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nIt sounds as though we are talking about protective capacities.  That is the way we talk about \nparents when we are talking about neglect—it is their protective capacities; their ability to \nprotect their child from harm and to do so willingly, right?  Would you look for language and \nbe supportive of language that talks about a child's protective capacity?  The capacity to \nknow how to call for law enforcement or for help if they needed to?  Would that be the \ndirection you would want to see people go? \n \nBrigid Duffy: \nYes, absolutely. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nNext, we have Dr. Rachel Flynn. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 28, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nRachel Flynn, Ph.D., Private Citizen, Reno, Nevada: \nI am a developmental psychologist and currently a professor of child development.  I also \nhave a private practice working with children.  For over a decade, I was a director of youth \ndevelopment programs and I worked really closely on many cases with child protective \nservices.  I support this bill because I believe it is good for child development.  I have worked \nwith a huge range of children from diverse ethnicities, socioeconomic statuses, urban and \nrural populations, and with a lot of different cognitive abilities—from the gifted and talented \nto those with severe intellectual delays who are nonverbal. \n \nI want to address this idea of maturity.  A lot of it has already been said, but it is very \nimportant to recognize that chronological age does not often align with developmental age.  \nThere are so many variations based on an individual child—their capacities, their cognition, \ntheir self-regulation, and also their culture.  Context matters so much—the things that have \nbeen said around parent responsibility but also professional responsibility in this.  While \nleaving things vague might seem challenging, anyone who is trained to work with children \nunderstands the differences between chronological age and developmental age and knows \nhow to take those contexts into consideration. \n \nThe culture of fear that has been discussed previously is creating a culture of children who \nhave higher mental health challenges.  They have more learning disabilities.  It is creating \nstress and anxiety and limits their agency.  What we really need to do is overestimate \nsometimes children's developmental abilities.  We need to call on the developmental science \nresearch to understand that children need to practice using their executive functioning skills \nto make decisions, to solve problems.  They need to use their visual-spatial skills to move \nthrough the world in different ways.  They need to have these complex social interactions \nthat flex their theory of mind, and they need to be able to play—unstructured play that is not \nalways adult- or technology-directed or adult-supervised.  For all those reasons, that helps \nlead children to develop into being intelligent, resilient, and independent children.  \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any other callers on Zoom? \n \nDiane Redleaf: \nI am the legal consultant to Let Grow and I advocate for laws such as the one you are \nconsidering today.  I wanted to address a couple of points that were brought up in the \nhearing.  Our office did a 50-state survey of these laws that was published back in May.  \nI went back to that survey to look at the question of age limits.  What I found in the survey \nwe had done—an exhaustive study—is that approximately 13 states have some reference to \nage, but the age ranges from 6 to 12 and there does not seem to be any consistency about \nwhat the age allows for.  As Dr. Flynn just explained, our concern about age limits is that \nthey do not bear a direct relationship to actual functional abilities and they can function as a \ndouble-edged sword.  We have also seen policy guidance in the course of reviewing these \nstate policies, and we can provide some of that to the Committee as they consider the rules, \nbecause guidance is something that not only the caseworkers and social workers need, but the \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 28, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nparents also need in order to know how to make a decision as to whether their child is mature \nenough. \n \nWe believe these laws, as they have been passing, actually help provide safety and security \nfor children because they not only address their mental health needs, but they make them \nmore capable for the future.  We talk about this as a measure that actually \"future-proofs\" our \nchildren.  As mentioned, we believe that there is tremendous variation in the needs of parents \nto be able to address the needs of their children in their own ways without having the chilling \neffect of a threat of possibly guessing wrong about what someone else is going to think is \nneglect. \n \nThis is a small step.  It does not change investigation procedures; it does not change the \nduties of mandated reporters.  It will continue to support and increase the ability of child \nprotective services to concentrate on the serious cases and apply their judgment to the \nspecific children who are engaged in independent activities.  We believe we need to more \nclearly define the difference between good and bad parenting, and that when children are \nready, giving them independence needs to be within the lines that the law recognizes as part \nof good parenting.  Thank you for considering the bill, and I appreciate the hard work the \nsponsors have put into this and all the consideration the other advocates and stakeholders \nhave put into this measure. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAt this time, I will go to the phone lines and begin testimony in support of S.B. 143 (R1). \n \nDora Uchel-Martinez, Private Citizen, Reno, Nevada: \nI  am  representing  the  Nevada  Disability  Prevention  Coalition  and  thank  you  so  much, \nSenator Dallas Harris.  I used to be a single mom of five.  Two kids have made it to the \nmilitary—one is in the Marines.  We do know our children better than anyone else, despite \nour disability.  \n \nNick  Shepack,  Policy  and  Program  Associate,  American  Civil  Liberties  Union  of \nNevada: \nThe American Civil Liberties Union believes that this bill addresses a very serious racial \njustice issue.  To drive home that racial justice issue, I want to share a few numbers from \nWashoe County.  From 2016 to 2020, the North Lake Tahoe area, which is 95 percent white \nwith a population of about 10,000 people, had 42 child welfare investigations and only \n2 child removals.  The south Reno area, which is 90 percent white, has a population of \n27,000, had 142 investigations and 33 removals.  The ZIP Code in which I live in Reno, \nwhich includes Midtown and the area around the Reno airport, is only 65 percent white with \na population of about 40,000.  It had over 18,000 investigations and 535 removals.  North \nReno up to North Valleys is 59 percent white and has a population of 20,000.  They had over \n1,000 investigations and 336 removals.  What we have found through our research in looking \nat ZIP Codes is that, by looking at the number of investigations and child removals, you can \ndirectly tell which ZIP Codes have the highest minority populations.  This is a real problem, \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 28, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nand we believe this bill takes real steps to address this issue.  For these reasons, as well as the \nother reasons stated by the presenters, we urge you to support this bill. \n \nCharlie Melvin, Director of Public Relations, Power2Parent: \n[Charlie Melvin submitted a letter of support from Erin Phillips, President, Power2Parent, \nExhibit F.]  We represent nearly 10,000 parents across the state of Nevada.  Our organization \nexists to empower parents to advocate for their children because we believe that parents \nknow their children best.  We are in support of S.B. 143 (R1) because we believe that only \nparents understand the maturity of their child and can make the best decisions regarding their \nlevel  of  independence.    We  also  know  low-income  families  can  be  disproportionately \naffected for multiple reasons but especially because both parents may need to work, and \nfamilies should not be punished for providing for their families. \n \nParenting is difficult enough without the fear of child protective services or other government \nagencies second-guessing reasonable parenting decisions.  We understand and appreciate the \nneed for these agencies in cases of real and serious neglect or abuse, but we also know that \nresponsible parents can and should be allowed to make reasonable parenting decisions about \nthe maturity and independence of their kids.  We are grateful for this bipartisan legislation \nthat protects the rights of parents to make reasonable parenting decisions for their children.  \nTo that end, we also appreciate Assemblyman Hafen's question and agree with Senator \nHarris that both \"free-range\" and \"cage-free\" parenting titles are appropriate for this bill.  \nThank you to everyone who worked on this. \n \nLenore Skenazy, President, Let Grow: \n[Lenore Skenazy submitted written testimony in support, Exhibit G.]  Let Grow is a nonprofit \nthat promotes childhood independence.  We push back on the idea that helicopter parenting is \ngood for kids.  Before this, I wrote a book called Free-Range Kids, not cage-free kids.  At \nLet Grow, we believe in safety—helmets, seat belts, car seats, all the ways parents can keep \ntheir kids safe from unnecessary harm.  We also believe it is great for kids to have some \nindependence, just like you have been hearing throughout this amazing session.  Kids can run \nsome errands and climb some trees when their parents feel they are ready for it, but I get so \nmany letters from parents saying that they want their kids to walk to the store and play \noutside.  They do not want them on the couch all day staring at a screen, but they are afraid to \nlet them do anything on their own because someone could call 911, someone who does not \nknow their kids the way they do.  So they second-guess themselves and keep the kids inside.   \n \nThe problem is that when kids are treated as if they are fragile, they start to believe it.  \nChildhood anxiety and depression are on the rise, but in 2018, as you heard, Utah passed a \nlaw changing that.  It was the \"free-range parenting law.\"  We heard from parents in Utah \nwho told us that once the law passed, they could breathe easier.  One dad told us he was kind \nof a helicopter dad; he was always worried about letting his kids walk to school or trick-or-\ntreat without an adult, but as they got older, he saw the kids were getting frustrated easily and \nunable to solve problems on their own.  For this, he blamed a lack of real-world interaction.  \nHis kids were not getting on the bus, paying the right money, sitting next to the bus driver.  \nIn desperation, he started to let them play in the park on their own and wander around the \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 28, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nneighborhood and play, and thanks to Utah's childhood independence law, he felt he could do \nwhat was best for his kids.   \n \nSometimes I ask people to think back on what they most loved doing as a kid.  Almost \neveryone will say what I bet you will say—that they loved playing with their friends, riding \ntheir bikes, building forts.  No one has ever said that what they loved most was having their \nmom right there hovering over them.  That is why we are so excited to be working in \nNevada, and we so appreciate our sponsors and all the stakeholders—all the people who have \nspoken today.  Together I think you will do great things for the kids and parents of Nevada.  \nThank you for supporting reasonable childhood independence. \n \nAndrea Keith, Executive Director, Let Grow: \nI am the Executive Director of Let Grow and a resident of Nevada.  I started my career as an \nelementary school teacher in California and also taught in northern Colorado and in Illinois.  \nMy classrooms were always very diverse—academically, economically, and racially—and \nI had to fulfill my obligation more than once as a court-mandated reporter.  I believe strongly \nthat society must protect children from harm, but I also have known hundreds of children \nwho, while in the same grade, were each unique in their maturity and their capacity for \nhandling things on their own.  Experience is definitely the best teacher, and children need to \nbe  able  to  learn  to  navigate  their  world,  advocate  for  themselves,  and  solve  real-life \nproblems—which is difficult to do if we keep them inside and do not give them those \nopportunities.  I can tell you that child development experts, psychologists, and educators \nwill all tell you that children who are allowed to have independent experiences are more \nresilient, happier, more confident, and more successful in school.  In fact, this is one area that \ncan give lower-income and other cultures an advantage, as their children are often expected \nto be more mature and independent, out of necessity, as opposed to privileged children who \nfrequently have things done for them.  Thank you for your attention and for considering this \nbill, and I am very proud to be a Nevada resident with this going on.  \n \nDaniel Hansen, M.D., Private Citizen, Reno, Nevada: \n[Daniel Hansen submitted a letter of support, Exhibit H.]  I am a physician and a father \ncalling in support of this bill.  Thank you, Assembly Committee, for hearing this.  I want to \nconcur with the vast majority of the testimony and want to highlight the excellent points \nmade by the psychologist about the discrepancy we often see between developmental age and \nchronological age.  I deal with a lot of pediatric anesthesia and, on the front lines, see some \nof the worst cases of neglect and abuse.  It is horrible stuff and this legislation in no way \nmakes it okay, nor is there any hint that, as a state, we are okay with neglecting and abusing \nour children.  In the setting of this last year in particular, we have all seen the deleterious \neffects of children being sequestered inside.  We are increasingly seeing the actual clinical \nmanifestations of problems from children not being able to go out, play in the park, fall down \nand scrape their knees and have to deal with it without a parent being right there.   \n \nMore than anything, this legislation has done a great job of finding that balance between \ngiving parents the latitude to decide what is best for their children, but also keeping the final \nsay in the hands of the people on the ground—the agencies that are dealing with this—and \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 28, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nnot being restricted by an age cutoff or some legislative mandate.  The message we are \nsending to our parents, especially to the single parents, the lower-socioeconomic strata, the \nminority parents, is incredibly encouraging, and we should all stand with our heads high and \nproudly support this bill.  Perhaps more than anything, it is a legislative unicorn.  When you \nhave Assemblywoman Hansen and Senator Harris side by side, with the support of Senator \nIra Hansen on a bill, it is probably something we all should pay attention to. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any other callers in support?  [There were none.]   \n \n[Exhibit I, testimony in support, was submitted but not discussed and will be included in the \nrecord.] \n \nDo we have any callers in opposition to S.B. 143 (R1)?  [There were none.]  We will now \nbegin testimony in neutral here in our committee room. \n \nKendra  G.  Bertschy,  Deputy  Public  Defender,  Washoe  County  Public  Defender's \nOffice: \nMy office represents not only individuals who are accused of crimes, but we also represent \nthe parents in these Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 432B cases.  I have had the \nprivilege of also being a children's attorney at Washoe Legal Services.  I have worked at the \nUniversity of Nevada, Reno, teaching a course on families and public policies.  This issue is \nvery near and dear to my heart, and I want to thank Senator Harris and Assemblywoman \nHansen for all their hard work on this bill.  It really has been a journey, with several different \namendments as you heard even today, and with an additional proposed amendment. \n \nWe absolutely support the intention of this bill.  It is greatly needed.  We need to clarify our \nchild abuse/neglect statutes not only in the dependency system, but also in the criminal \nsystem.  It is very concerning when we are hearing stories about individuals whose children \nhave been removed or a criminal proceeding that has been initiated because of things like \na child being outside the home unsupervised where there were no other issues.  So we greatly \nappreciate this bill and hope this will provide some additional clarity to a confusing system \nthat has significant consequences. \n \nIf someone is convicted of child abuse or neglect, it could be a misdemeanor, a gross \nmisdemeanor, or it could be a felony.  A gross misdemeanor or felony are mandatory prison \nor jail sentences unless there is an evaluation saying that they are not a high risk.  So there \nare very significant consequences.  All defense attorneys have examples of cases where this \nbill in particular would have helped ensure that a child would have remained with the family, \nor that criminal proceedings would not have been initiated.  We just hope that when the \nDivision  of  Child  and  Family  Services  creates  those  regulations,  we  are  kept  in  those \ndiscussions to ensure that we are doing what we need. \n \nTo Assemblywoman Thomas's point, I would note that in Washoe County, in Sparks, and in \nReno, there are different ages as to what the requirements are for someone to be at home.  \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 28, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nUnfortunately, with a lot of the population I work with, they move from Reno to Sparks and \nback, depending on what is available for housing.  As we all know, housing is a huge issue \nright now, and people may not know that if they cross to the other side of the street, there \nmight be a different age limit they have to be aware of.  We hope this provides some much-\nneeded clarity. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nThis is the same question I asked the bill's sponsor and Ms. Duffy.  We are going to prescribe \nin regulations this concept—there is not going to be a chronological age; so when we talk \nabout sufficient maturity, for the record, how do you see that as being well-defined in \na regulation? \n \nKendra Bertschy: \nThat is a very important question.  I agree with the statements that have been made on the \nrecord.  I would just note that one of the things I think is extremely important is that it should \nnot be the defense attorney or the parent who has to prove that the child was of sufficient \nmaturity.  Just because of the way our criminal justice system works and the dependency \nsystem, the onus should be on an agency to have to provide some of that information if we \nare going to have regulations.  That is why I want the defense bar to be able to participate in \nthat. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nThanks.    I  will  follow  up.    This  is  not  a  trick  question,  but  being  on  the  Legislative \nCommission,  you  are  going  to  have  members  who  have  to  vote  yes  or  no  once  these \nregulations are put in front of them.  There will be three workshops where they will be \nconsidered and language will change, but if a regulation comes in front of me and has \na chronological age, does that keep with the intent of the legislation, or not?  I think I am \nhearing no, but I have not heard anyone definitely say no.  So I am guessing the regulation is \ngoing to use words to describe \"maturity.\"  When we are looking at that regulation, in what \ndirection are we looking for the agency to go when they are writing those regulations?  \nClearly, we could put in there that the defense attorney for a parent should have a say, or \nsomething like that.  I am not trying to be tricky.  I asked about protective capacities and kind \nof heard \"maybe yes,\" but I would think for sure, protective capacities, but what does that \nmean for a child?   \n \nBecause we have some references to ages in other pieces of the statute, you might want to put \nin a floor such as under three, because we know when child welfare gets the call, there is \na consideration for age.  Generally, if the child is under three, those are elevated.  I do not \nknow if there is a consideration for a floor, or if the sponsor would be offended if there was \na floor—some kind of age in there.  You also have a bunch of grey area you are trying to \ndefine.  Since NRS Chapter 432B is about what you ought not to do, then we are defining the \ninverse in this section—which is what you can do.  That is harder because it is a different \nparadigm than the way the rest of the chapter is written.  This is a sincere question for the \nrecord so we can look back to see if we are close or are getting it right.  If I get a set of \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 28, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nregulations in front of me and you folks say, \"This is not what we intended,\" we would look \nback to the record to see if that was right or wrong from the hearing.  Did they get close?        \n   \nKendra Bertschy: \nWe had some discussions.  I do not speak for the sponsors and I am sure they will provide \nthis in their closing remarks, but I would not feel that having an age limit of, for example \nthree  years  old—saying  that  someone  at  age  three  should  not  be  allowed  to  be \nunsupervised—that that would negate the intent of this bill.  That was one of the discussions \nwe had about possibly having a floor.  The main issue is because every child is different, \nhaving that limit of 12 years old may work for some children but may not work for others.  \nThat is why I agree with you.  Some of the terms we used were exactly what you were \nincluding in your remarks as what to consider with a child's capacity, with classes they have \nhad, and things of that nature, where they know, as we discussed, the numbers to call.  They \nknow grandma is down the street and they can go there if they need help.  They are fully \ncapable of calling 911, and those are part of the discussion we had.  I would not be opposed \nto—if there is included in the bill—a floor that we discussed. \n \nRoss E. Armstrong, Administrator, Division of Child and Family Services, Department \nof Health and Human Services:   \nWe submitted some information to the Committee that is on NELIS [Nevada Electronic \nLegislative Information System] about child neglect in general [Exhibit J].  We have heard \na lot that the intent of this bill is to help educate parents, and we wanted to make sure that \nthere was still a lot of good information out there in terms of what child neglect and what the \nchild welfare process looks like in the state of Nevada.  You can see that a lot of neglect in \nmany cases ends in physical or sexual injury to a child.  We want to make sure that in no way \nare we downplaying the nature of neglect.   \n \nI also think it is important in our neutral testimony today to note that there is no current \nprohibition in Nevada law on children engaging safely in independent activities.  Sometimes \nwhen we are discussing an issue, it might seem as though we have to make those changes \nbecause there is currently some obstacle.  The way our child welfare workers in the field \nassess any situation is there is a call and an allegation, and that child welfare worker goes \ninto  the  field  and  assesses  the  entirety  of  that  situation.    There  does  need  to  be \na determination of whether there is going to be a substantiation to the actual allegation of \nabuse or neglect.  The model of child welfare now is very different than, say, the criminal \njustice  process  where  the  idea  is  that  something  has  happened;  you  determine  beyond \na reasonable doubt whether it happened; and if so, here is your punishment.  The child \nwelfare system is very much focused on getting to a situation that someone has alerted the \nagency to and working to determine if there are actual, ongoing, safety threats to that child.  \nWe are not going to open a case just because there might have been a kid walking down the \nstreet alone and that one particular instance was unsafe.  We are going to take a holistic \napproach to the family, and so, we provided that data to the Committee for your information. \n \nTo  respond  to  some  of  Assemblywoman  Benitez-Thompson's  questions  about  the \nregulations, I cannot speak for the bill's sponsors, but I really appreciated the concept of \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 28, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nprotective capacity.  Generally, when we analyze protective capacity in the child welfare \nsystem, we are talking about the parent's ability to protect the child from harm.  Taking that \nframework  of  maturity  which  is  synonymous  with  development,  and  then  adding  that \nelement of the child's protective capacity, really makes sense in terms of how to articulate \nthat advice to the three different child welfare agencies.  I do not imagine that the regulations \nwill have some sort of age and activity or region matrix, but rather it is really the regulations \nwhere we get guidance to social workers in the field when they have an instance where \nneglect has been called in and it is a child who is not under the supervision of anybody, who \nmay be engaging in independent activities or may be neglected.  Those regulations really \nhelp educate and get the child welfare workers to view those particular situations with certain \nstandards.  I think having information about a child's protective capacity in there is key.  In \nall of our cases, we take a look at that individual's family situation—because no two families \nare the same—when making determinations about a substantiation of allegation of abuse or \nneglect, and also the need for an agency to become involved—to step in and try to help and \nsupport that family maintain safety and really trying to get to the point of the Division of \nChild  and  Family  Services  vision  of  safe,  healthy,  and  thriving  kids  in  every  Nevada \ncommunity.   \n \nWe are neutral on this.  We appreciate the many meetings and the work trying to make sure \nthat this language is designed to be helpful to parents and not judgmental to kids.  There has \nbeen a lot of work from a lot of different stakeholders, and we certainly appreciate that.  \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo you have any follow-up questions? \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nNo, I think there is enough there for a direction.  Obviously, Mr. Armstrong will be tasked \nwith writing this, so we will see it from his Division coming forward.  It sounds as though the \nworkshop process will help inform the process as well.  It is not just this piece; it is any law \nwhere you are silent on something and you are going to put a regulation in, but then you are \nno longer silent—you are doomed to what is in and what is out.  Right now, nothing is in, so \nwe are going to clearly define what is in by defining what is out.  You want to make sure you \nhave a bright line showing where you are going to walk as things are drafted moving \nforward. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nSomeone else is here to testify in neutral. \n \nJeanette Belz, representing Children's Advocacy Alliance: \nI would like to extend the regrets of our Executive Director, Dr. Tiffany Tyler-Garner.  \nShe was unable to attend the hearing today.  The Children's Advocacy Alliance (CAA) is \nneutral,  after  consultation  with  many  parties,  including  the  child  welfare  agencies,  law \nenforcement, the bill's sponsors, and attending their briefing.  The Children's Advocacy \nAlliance  appreciates  the  amendments  to  improve  the  bill,  including  Clark  County's \namendments, and implores you to continue to ensure protection for children while addressing \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 28, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \nthe overrepresentation of certain populations and communities in the child welfare system.  \nWe  would  like  to  extend  special  thanks  to  Sarah  Adler  for  her  diligence  and  many \nconversations and texts about this, and CAA definitely looks forward to working with DCFS \nand other stakeholders in the development of these regulations.  We tend to agree with \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson that that is where the \"meat\" is going to be, ultimately, \nand appreciate her questions in that regard. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any other testimony in neutral on this bill?  [There was none.]  With that, I will \ncall our bill sponsor back for any closing remarks on S.B. 143 (R1). \n \nSenator Harris: \nThank you for giving us so much time to hear this important bill.  I really appreciate it.  \nThere has been a lot of discussion and great questions from the Committee.  I have a lot of \nfaith in Mr. Armstrong and the administrative procedures, as I am an administrative attorney.  \nI believe through the workshops, with the participation of the experts, they can nail down \nthese details much better than I could in statute.   \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson, to answer your question about a floor of three years \nold, I would be more than happy to have a floor of age three, but that is as much as I would \nbe willing to commit to when it comes to an age limit.  That is particularly because we can all \nagree that a three-year-old does not have that protective capacity, as you were describing—\neven the most mature of three-year-olds. \n \nWith that, I think we are probably going to have one last amendment to add on some bill \nsponsors.  I know Assemblyman Hafen would like to be added on, and Assemblywoman \nKrasner  expressed  interest  in  being  added  on,  as  well  as  Assemblywoman  Nguyen, \nAssemblywoman Peters, and Assemblywoman Gorelow.  Look, the whole Committee.  I will \nbe working with Assemblywoman Hansen to make sure we get you all amended onto the bill.  \nThank you for your time. \n \nAssemblywoman Hansen: \nI just want to thank you so much and reiterate that we are not here in any way to discourage \nconcerned citizens from reporting suspicious or concerning behavior they might see in their \nneighborhoods involving children.  In fact, we would ask them to reach out and contact those \nparents person-to-person.  If that is not possible, of course they should report it if they are \nconcerned.  Again, this is the spectrum we are talking about:  reaffirming responsible parents \nwho  have  the  ability  to  make  those  kinds  of  decisions  about  their  children  and  their \nreasonable independence.  Thank you again for your time.  We appreciate the stakeholders \ninvolved and all those, including yourselves, who work hard on behalf of the children of the \nstate of Nevada. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 28, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWith that, I will close the hearing on S.B. 143 (R1).  At this time, I will welcome Senator \nOhrenschall to the Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services and we will start \nwith Senate Bill 146 (1st Reprint).  \n \nSenate Bill 146 (1st Reprint):  Revises provisions relating to mental health services for \nchildren. (BDR 39-870) \n \nJames Ohrenschall, Senate District No. 21: \nSenate Bill 146 (1st Reprint) is a short bill but a very important bill.  It deals with children \nbeing admitted to an inpatient mental health facility.  Being admitted acute is a scary thing, \nespecially if it is your child or a child you are representing in court or even a child you just \nhappen to hear about.  Often, the treatment is desperately needed, and that is why the child is \nbeing admitted.  Senate Bill 146 (1st Reprint) tries to make sure that if that child—who is \nbeing admitted acute to an inpatient mental health facility—already has a mental health \nprovider, is already getting treatment, that that provider is consulted, that if the child is to be \nadmitted, the strongest attempts at continuity of care occur.  Many of us who practice in \njuvenile court or family court have seen cases where a child is admitted and maybe there is \na disconnect  between  the  mental  health  provider  who  treated  the  child  before  and  the \ninformation that provider has is not always available.  Now I will turn this over to Gillian \nBlock and Amy Honodel of the Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada. \n \nAmy Honodel, Staff Attorney, Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada: \nI am a staff attorney with the Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada in the Children's \nAttorneys Project where I also serve as the strategic initiative manager.  This bill is short, but \nit  is  critical  for  our  youth  in  foster  care  in  that  it  opens  and  solidifies  a  conduit  of \ncommunication between mental health providers, those seeing foster youth regularly, and \nthose who are seeing a child in crisis as they are being admitted or considered for admission \ninto a mental health facility.   \n \nSection 1, subsection 1 requires the admitting facility to find out from the legal custodian if \nthere is a treating provider of mental health services for that child and to make a reasonable \neffort to contact that person.  The provider who usually sees the child and the admitting \nfacility must talk about the child's condition, including whether or not to admit that child.  \nSubsection 3 requires the admitting facility to try to get consent from the legal custodian as \nwell as consent from the child to have this ongoing dialogue with the main treating provider, \nincluding  coordinating  discharge  planning.    Subsection  4  of  section  1  says  that  if  an \nadmitting facility cannot get consent from either the legal custodian or the child, that they can \nstill take the necessary actions, including communicating with that main treating provider if it \nis in the child's health and welfare to either maintain it or improve it. \n \nThis bill is brought out of our real-world experiences down here, representing children in \nClark County in foster care.  In some cases, we see where this communication would have \nprevented an admission.  I have a former client who was facing going with her biological \nfather and made some comments that were considered to be enough to admit her to a facility.  \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 28, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \nBut when her primary treating therapist got involved, it turns out the comments were not \nabout a crisis but her repeating something she had heard someone else say to avoid being \nmoved, and we were able to address her concerns without her being admitted to this facility.   \n \nAnother client of mine who is still my client was admitted to a facility and was given a new \nmedication, which really helped his behavior and some other concerns that were addressed.  \nFor whatever reason, as he was discharged, the fact he was on new medication did not get \nrelayed to his ongoing providers—his therapists or his doctors—so he had an outburst which \ncaused him to disrupt.  He was with an uncle who had no children of his own at the time.  \nBecause of the intensity of the outburst and an inability to contain it, he was afraid to take \nthis client of mine back into his home.  If we had more coordination of discharge planning, \nwe might have been able to avert this crisis.  This is in no way to undermine the care these \nhospitals provide.  We just want to get everyone communicating and on the same page with \nchildren who are not in the system; this is something that a parent would do, but a lot of my \nclients do not have healthy parents right now to do this, so this would just solidify that \ncommunication.  \n  \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there questions? \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI have a question about section 1, subsection 4, which reads, \"Failure of a person or entity \nhaving legal custody of a child or a child to provide consent . . . .\"  Then this gives directives \nto go ahead and proceed anyway, based on if it was \"necessary to protect or improve the \nhealth or welfare of the child.\"  If the person or entity having the legal custody said, No, we \ndo not want you to do that, will this supersede if they say, No, you cannot do that?  Are you \ngoing to go ahead and do it anyway?  Is that what I am reading here? \n \nSenator Ohrenschall: \nThe way I read it, the objection of the guardian to the contact between the treating mental \nhealth provider prior to admission to the facility, that conversation could still happen even if \nthere is an objection.  This is trying to make sure there is continuity of care.   \n \nAmy Honodel: \nTo the point Senator Ohrenschall stated, it is limited to that particular part of the consent.  \nIt would still allow for continuity of care in this case. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI just needed some clarity. \n \nAmy Honodel: \nThere is language in there limiting that, so it is only when necessary to protect or improve the \nhealth or welfare of the child.  It does not allow the provider to go beyond that.   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 28, 2021 \nPage 27 \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank you for that clarity.  There could be an instance in my mind where maybe the parent \ndid not like the initial provider and would not want that provider communicating with \nanother provider.  I wanted to make sure there was some level of parental control still \ninvolved—or whoever had legal custody.  I do understand the concept of a safe handoff; I do \nunderstand being able to communicate with fellow providers; but I had a concern over that \nissue. \n \nSenator Ohrenschall: \nThe way I read this, it would be more of a case where that parent or guardian might not be \nquickly available versus trying to go against their wishes.  That is how I interpret where this \nwould mostly be used. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have other questions? \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI want to go over how you see this being enacted.  Section 1, on the \"shall,\" about asking:  \nI assume that would be one of the questions on the questionnaire as you start that admission \nprocess for someone when you are collecting demographic information.  That would be \na piece of information being requested on those admission forms.  Would that be acceptable, \nor do you want a verbal request? \n \nSenator Ohrenschall: \nI would want as much effort as possible from the inpatient treatment facility trying to reach \nthe current provider.  I have had cases where I represented children who may not be under \nNevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 432B but that were in the delinquency system, and \nI have had parents who feel that they were doing very well with their outpatient mental health \nprovider prior to being in an inpatient facility and were not doing so well.  I would want as \nmuch effort as possible from the inpatient hospital trying to reach the mental health provider. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nThen in section 1, subsection 2, after they have asked for the information and have it, it says, \n\"reasonable effort to consult.\"  Typically, when we think of \"reasonable\" or \"due diligence\" \nwe tend to think of a number such as \"three\"—make three phone calls or make two phone \ncalls.  Are you looking for them to make one or two calls; and if, at that point, they have not \nheard back, they can abandon the effort?  What would you say is \"reasonable\"? \n \nSenator Ohrenschall: \nIn law school, they teach us about the \"reasonable person\" standard.  I certainly would want \nas much effort as possible made to contact that prior mental health provider.  However, there \nwill be a point where the physician or treating health care provider at that inpatient hospital \nwill have to make some decisions and try to stabilize the child.  I know we have a letter from \nthe Nevada Psychological Association, but I am not sure we are going to have any testimony \nfrom them, because I think someone with that expertise might be better suited to answer that \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 28, 2021 \nPage 28 \n \nquestion.  Possibly Ms. Honodel would care to jump in but, certainly, there would be a point \nat which the treating provider at the inpatient hospital would have to take over if they cannot \nget ahold of the prior mental provider. \n \nAmy Honodel: \nI do not think we can quantify with a number, but what typically happens is these children \nactually go to our emergency rooms while the staff of the emergency room or the legal \ncustodian is trying to find a bed for them at a facility that will take a youth.  During that time, \nthat is, the time when we would be looking for a facility that has been identified that has \na bed, that they would be making those efforts to find or talk to or communicate with the \nmain treating provider.  I do not think it is a good idea to put a number, but it would \nobviously depend on the time—after hours or a weekend—and maybe making an effort the \nnext day during business hours and reaching out to that physician's call service.  But the idea \nwould be to make those efforts and also start bringing the child into care.  Any concerns \nwould then be addressed with the next part when we talk about coordinating care and then \ndischarge planning, so that even if an admitting facility is not able to connect with the main \nprovider, that later on they are connecting with that provider, so when the child is able to \nleave, there is continuity of care on that end. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nIs this just regulated to Clark County or to the entire state? \n \nSenator Ohrenschall: \nThis would apply to all the counties.  This is just trying to make sure that if a child is \nadmitted acute, that there is that conversation with the prior provider.  It would be helpful \nacross the state. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nI appreciate that.  When I heard \"Clark County\" I was not sure.  I am sure throughout the \nstate, foster care youth are in crisis, so I appreciate that clarification. \n \nSenator Ohrenschall: \nSometimes there are children in the foster care system who also end up in the delinquency \nsystem.  They get arrested and sometimes the juvenile judge in Clark County may commit \na child to a youth correctional facility such as the Caliente Youth Center in Caliente, Nevada, \nor to the Nevada Youth Training Center in Elko, or there are some other facilities around the \nstate that are privately run.  If a child who we call a \"dual ward\" child—who is also in the \nfoster care system—might have a mental health crisis and needs to be admitted acute, their \nprior treating physician might be in Clark County, Washoe County, Carson City, or in \nDouglas County, so this bill would be even more important because you could have a child at \none of those facilities.  Here, at least, we would be requiring that they try to reach out to that \ndoctor even if the doctor is in Las Vegas, Henderson, or Reno.  In the past, I am not sure that \neffort was always made. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 28, 2021 \nPage 29 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any other questions from Committee members at this time?  [There were none.]  \nDo we have anyone to testify in support of S.B. 146 (R1)? \n \nKendra  G.  Bertschy,  Deputy  Public  Defender,  Washoe  County  Public  Defender's \nOffice: \nWe wanted to put our support for this bill on the record.  We have seen instances where \nchildren have been harmed because they were admitted into hospitals for these emergency \nplacements when their treating physicians were adamantly opposed to it afterwards.  I can \nspeak from personal experience with my clients that this has been an issue in Washoe \nCounty, so I assume it is occurring across the state, from what we have heard.  We really \nappreciate Senator Ohrenschall for bringing this bill and championing to improve the lives of \nour children.  We thank you and urge your support. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI do not see anyone else in the room, so we will go to the phone lines to take testimony in \nsupport of S.B. 146 (R1).   \n \nBrigid  J.  Duffy,  Chief  Deputy  District  Attorney,  Juvenile  Division,  Clark  County \nDistrict Attorney's Office: \nI am appearing on behalf of the Department of Family Services in Clark County that believes \nSenate Bill 146 (1st Reprint) is solid policy in the best interests of children in foster care.  \nIt supports better coordination of care between admitting acute psychiatric treatment facilities \nand our current treatment providers.  We thank Senator Ohrenschall for bringing forth this \npiece of legislation and our community partners at Legal Aid Services for their work on \nbehalf of our children in foster care. \n \nLaura Drucker, Psy.D., Legislative Co-Chair, Nevada Psychological Association: \n[Laura Drucker submitted a letter in support, Exhibit K.]  I am here to testify in support of \nthis legislation.  I want to thank Senator Ohrenschall and the Committee for your work on \nthis legislation to improve the coordination of care for foster kids in Nevada.  We appreciate \nthat the language has expanded to include notification of a wider range of providers of \nmental and behavioral health care for these children.  We believe that the efforts to notify the \nprimary treatment providers of kids when there is a crisis, when they may need an acute stay, \nwould be beneficial for the children primarily and also for the coordination of care across the \nsystem—both inpatient and outpatient treatment. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have anyone in opposition?  [There was no one.]  Do we have anyone testifying in \nneutral on S.B. 146 (R1)?   \n \nAlexis  Tucey,  Deputy  Administrator,  Community  Services,  Division  of  Child  and \nFamily Services, Department of Health and Human Services: \nI am testifying in neutral today.  It has been a great pleasure working with the bill's sponsor \nas well as with the stakeholders and working through the amendments on this bill.  We are \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 28, 2021 \nPage 30 \n \nreally looking to improve our continuum of care and process with this population through the \nimportant services they need.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any questions?  I do not see any.  Is there anyone else who wishes to testify in \nneutral?  [There was no one.]  Do you have any closing remarks, Senator Ohrenschall? \n \nSenator Ohrenschall: \nThank you for hearing S.B. 146 (R1).  It is always scary when a child has to be admitted \nacute to an inpatient treatment facility.  Sometimes there is a lot of great treatment that \na child can receive there and it is the best option for that child.  I think this legislation, if it \npasses, will try to help improve outcomes for those children who have to be admitted, or \nperhaps do not have to be admitted.  If that communication can happen—if they have an \nongoing treatment provider—there will be better outcomes whether they are admitted or not.  \nI want to thank Bailey Bortolin, Amy Honodel, and Gillian Block at the Legal Aid Center; \nand Brigid Duffy with the Clark County District Attorney's Office; Dr. Tucey; and many \nother stakeholders who worked on this legislation.  We did amend it over in the Senate, \ntrying to get it right.  I appreciate your Committee's consideration. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWith that, I will close the hearing on S.B. 146 (R1) and open the hearing on Senate Bill 376 \n(1st Reprint). \n \nSenate Bill 376 (1st Reprint):  Revises provisions relating to child welfare. (BDR 38-503) \n \nSenator James Ohrenschall, Senate District No. 21: \nDuring the interim, I had the honor of chairing the interim Legislative Committee on Child \nWelfare and Juvenile Justice.  We were able to have six meetings—two in-person meetings \nbefore the pandemic hit.  We were not sure how we would finish all our work because we \nhad a lot of work from bills that came through from the prior session, but with the great help \nof our staff—Patrick Guinan, Julianne King, Eileen O'Grady, Karly O'Krent, Broadcast and \nProduction Services, IT [Information Technology], and other people here at the Legislative \nCounsel  Bureau,  we  were  able  to  continue,  have  our  meetings,  and  come  up  with  ten \nrecommendations on different issues.  We really accomplished a lot of good work.  Most of \nour recommendations were bipartisan—many were unanimous—so we were able to come to \nconsensus on a lot of the work of the interim Legislative Committee on Child Welfare and \nJuvenile Justice.  The Vice Chair was Assemblywoman Daniele Monroe-Moreno, who ably \nguided policy through that committee.   \n \nOne of our recommendations is Senate Bill 376 (1st Reprint).  This bill is an effort to try to \nprotect children in terms of the child welfare system and trying to make sure that someone \nwho works for either child protective services, sometimes called the Department of Family \nServices, will have the information they need to make the best decision for the protection of \nthat child.  Now I would like to turn this over to Tim Burch and Joanna Jacob from Clark \nCounty.  \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 28, 2021 \nPage 31 \n \nJoanna Jacob, Government Affairs Manager, Clark County: \nI am here to share the PowerPoint [Exhibit L], which will give you an overview of the bill. \n \nTim Burch, Administrator of Human Services, Clark County: \nThis change is a technical change, so it is helpful to show you within context where that fits.  \nOne of the primary goals of child welfare is the safety, permanency, and well-being of our \nchildren.  One of the principal tools we have to achieve that are investigations into reports of \nabuse and neglect [page 2, Exhibit L].  Each investigation should end in the disposition of \nthat investigation so we know the outcome.  The dispositions of substantiations help us frame \nintervention with a family—what protective capacity is the parent lacking in the situation?  \nHow can we help surround that family with the proper resources to potentially address that \ngap?  It helps inform future investigations as well, in case we have a repeat situation where a \nchild comes to our attention, to examine past patterns—always looking to examine the \nprotective capacity of a parent.  If we find there is a substantiation, a positive finding of \nabuse or neglect, that maltreatment happened in that household, we report that to the Central \nRegistry.  The Central Registry is important because that is where employers look to screen \nindividuals who will be employed to work with children in the future.  It is also where we \nwould pull a lot of our reporting data to help justify our funding and other types of things.  \nThere were amendments to the initial bill presented in the Senate that clearly articulate that \nwe are only, as we have always, reporting substantiations into that Central Registry. \n \nThere has been a lot of conversation today about what happens when someone calls into the \nchild welfare system [page 3, Exhibit L].  We receive a report from someone who suspects \nchild abuse or neglect is happening.  We screen those decisions in, using a rubric to examine \nthe law and to see if anything being told to us rises to meet the standard of abuse or neglect \naccording to Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 432B.  In situations where that does \nappear to be the case, we assign that out for investigation to a child protective services \nworker.    We  can  also  assign  a  priority  to  whether  that  person  needs  to  respond \nimmediately—within  the  next  three  hours—or  within  one  business  day,  to  go  out  and \ninvestigate that allegation. \n \nThis last year, we received 25,000 calls into our hotline [page 4] reporting abuse or neglect.  \nFewer than half of those, about 11,600, actually wound up being assigned for investigation—\nabout 40 percent.  Once an investigation is assigned, we go through a process [page 5].  \nSome of that has already been discussed here today.  We look to see if that family has \nCentral Registry history, if that person is in our case management system, do we have prior \ninteractions, is there past history or patterns.  We do this initial assessment; we then go out \nand  interview  the  alleged  victim,  the  alleged  perpetrator,  collateral  sources—teachers, \nresponsible adults in the home, and the like [page 6].  We move then into doing a full safety \nassessment.  We have 45 days in order to fully assess the well-being of that child, to move to \na place of giving a disposition.  Right now, when we enter a disposition to the case, we have \ntwo choices in the state of Nevada—substantiated or unsubstantiated.  Substantiated is there \nis reasonable cause to believe abuse or neglect occurred in the situation and the person \nalleged to be the perpetrator was responsible for said abuse or neglect.  Unsubstantiated \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 28, 2021 \nPage 32 \n \nmeans there was insufficient evidence—we could not establish that threshold.  We have to \nchoose one of those two dispositions. \n \nYou will see that a vast majority of cases go unsubstantiated [page 7] for a myriad of reasons.  \nWe are very thorough.  It is our goal to always keep children safely in the home with \nthe parent  if  possible  and  wrap  that  child  with  resources.    This  last  year,  we  had \n2,400 substantiated investigations, and this is Clark County-specific data.  These next two \nslides are just to show you in context how other states deal with this issue [pages 8 and 9].  \nRight now, we have the two disposition types; Texas has five; New Hampshire has about \nseven; Missouri has about a dozen; California has three.  What we have done is look more \ntoward the Texas model.   \n \nWhat we are bringing before you is the ability to amend NRS 432B.300, section 6, to allow \nus to add the two following types:  unable to locate or contact; and administrative closure, \nand likewise, change the standard of proof from \"reasonable cause\" to \"preponderance of \nevidence.\"  That really just aligns with current state policy and current practice [page 10].  \nWe are looking at trying to align everything so families know exactly what to expect from \nthe system and that we are right out front with that. \n \nUnable to locate or contact [page 11, Exhibit L]:  You are all well-familiar with how \ntransient some of our population can be.  It is not uncommon for us to get a report of \nsuspected child abuse or neglect at a particular weekly motel or apartment and even within \nthe hour that we respond to that call, that family is unable to be located and no longer in that \nfacility.  Currently we have no choice but to label that \"unsubstantiated\" because that is the \nonly disposition type that would lend itself toward insufficient evidence at that time.  The \n\"unable to locate or contact,\" if supported, would allow us to label it in that way so we know \nit had not really thoroughly been investigated, so other jurisdictions, even within Nevada, \nwould see that there was an allegation of child abuse or neglect that was not sufficiently \ninvestigated, and they can pick that up as part of any potential future interaction with that \nfamily. \n \n\"Administrative closure\" tells us we do not have the authority to investigate that—it is out of \njurisdiction [page 12].  This allows us to put an actual administrative closure on a case that \ncame  to  us  from  another  jurisdiction  and  be  able  to  properly  hand  that  over  to  that \nappropriate jurisdiction to investigate while wrapping up that case in the case management \nsystem so we know it was properly adjudicated.    \n \nAs I stated before, this is a very technical change, but we feel it would help us more clearly \narticulate the status and disposition of investigations so we can better provide for the safety \nand well-being and permanency of the children we are charged with providing protection to. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any questions? \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 28, 2021 \nPage 33 \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI  appreciate  this.    This  makes  a  lot  of  sense—to  have  something  more  than  just \n\"substantiated\" or \"unsubstantiated\" and give a better description to what is happening when \nyou cannot move forward with something.  Let us take \"unable to determine.\"  Let us say you \nhave a call regarding sexual abuse of a child of six.  That child is of an age where they might \nnot accurately be a self-reporter so to ask them yes or no if they have indeed been harmed by \na family member, you are not sure they are going to tell you yes or no.  For \"undetermined,\" \nif you see some evidence but after investigations, you get to the end of the process and you \nare not able to have enough sufficient evidence, would this be a case where you would say \n\"unable to determine\" and then there would be that history of the investigation?  Six months \nlater if another call came in with the same kind of thing, you would be able to look back and \nsee a trend of these kinds of calls and the work the agency has done?  Would that be the right \nway for us to think about how something like that would be used? \n \nTim Burch: \nCurrently, that situation you described would be \"unsubstantiated.\"  In the case of a young \nchild about whom there was an allegation of sexual abuse, we would take them to our \nchildren's advocacy center where we are collocated with forensic interviewers.  They would \ngo through a very in-depth, rigorous process geared specifically toward the psychology of \na child and conduct that interview in a very safe way for them.  Meanwhile, law enforcement \nand  other  professionals  would  be  interviewing  the  alleged  perpetrator.    If  there  was \ninsufficient  evidence  there,  that  would  still  be  unsubstantiated  because  we  did  conduct \nan investigation.  This \"unable to locate or contact\" or \"administrative closure\" would not \napply in that specific situation because we did contact that family.  That case would most \nlikely wind up in that substantiated or unsubstantiated category because of the investigation \nbeing conducted. \n \nSenator Ohrenschall: \nI think this will give the agencies more tools, but it will also protect families and parents, \nbecause only a substantiation would go to that Central Registry.  That was an amendment \nproposed by the Washoe County Public Defender's Office in the Senate.  We agreed with that \namendment to try to make sure that only a substantiation would go into the Central Registry. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nThank you, Senator Ohrenschall, for bringing this Senate bill to us.  I feel very fortunate \ntoday to hear such bills.  I am a child advocate.  Mr. Burch indicated there were 45 days to \nassess the child.  Is that of the child's environment?  Also, are the 45 days consecutive? \n \nTim Burch: \nYes,  the  assessment  is  done  of  the  child's  functioning,  the  family  functioning,  parent \nprotective capacity, the environment—anything that plays into the allegation.  If it was an \nenvironmental neglect allegation, and certainly, environment plays a heavy role in that, \nalthough we assess the environment for every investigation.  It is 45 consecutive days for us \nto wrap up those safety assessments so we can keep in line with the practice model and, of \ncourse, giving parents their rights and day in court in a timely fashion as well. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 28, 2021 \nPage 34 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAs it stands right now, we only have those two dispositions.  Does that make us an outlier \nnationally?  Do other states have multiple dispositions, as this bill proposes? \n \nSenator Ohrenschall: \nMy recollection of the presentation during the interim committee hearing was that many \nstates have more than just the substantiated/unsubstantiated in terms of possible outcomes.  \nAs to how many have just what we have, I do not have that answer but can try to get that for \nyou.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you.  That would be great.  Are there any other questions from Committee members?  \nSeeing none, is there anyone in support of S.B. 376 (R1)? \n \nKendra  G.  Bertschy,  Deputy  Public  Defender,  Washoe  County  Public  Defender's \nOffice: \nI want to thank Senator Ohrenschall as well as the other stakeholders for allowing me to \nparticipate in the discussion to ensure that we are protecting the rights of the parents as well.  \nThere were concerns we initially had that we were able to resolve with the amendments, to \nmake sure that if one of the new dispositions was determined, that that information was not \nprovided to the Central Registry, and then that information, if there is anything that exists in \nthe Central Registry for an unsubstantiated claim, that that is not provided to employers.  The \nbiggest concern was that the additional information would be provided, which has significant \nconsequences on parents.  I have a parent I am still working with; we are trying to figure out \nemployment and housing because of the substantiated disposition that was released, so we \nappreciate this bill. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIs there additional testimony in support of S.B. 376 (R1)?  [There was none.]  Next, I will \nbegin opposition testimony of S.B. 376 (R1).  [There was none.]  Finally, I will go to neutral \ntestimony on S.B. 376 (R1). \n \nAlexis  Tucey,  Deputy  Administrator,  Community  Services,  Division  of  Child  and \nFamily Services, Department of Health and Human Services: \nI am testifying in neutral today for S.B. 376 (R1).  We appreciate working collaboratively \nwith the sponsors as well as with the stakeholders involved in this bill and moving forward \ntoward looking at safe, healthy, and thriving youth in every Nevada home.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there more callers in neutral?  [There were none.]  I will ask the sponsor for any closing \nremarks he might have. \n \nSenator Ohrenschall: \nDuring the interim committee, there was no opposition or concerns to this bill.  During this \nsession, we heard the concerns of the Washoe County Public Defender's Office Family \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 28, 2021 \nPage 35 \n \nDefense unit that represents parents in these actions.  I appreciate Clark County, Tim Burch, \nand Brigid Duffy from the Clark County District Attorney's Office working with the Washoe \nCounty Public Defender's Family Defense unit, trying to strike a balance here.  I think this \nbill does give the Division of Child and Family Services workers extra tools so they have a \nlittle more knowledge to know if something was not necessarily unsubstantiated, but the \nfamily was unable to be located; or there was not jurisdiction to open up a case there, but also \nto protect parents where there is no substantiation.  I think it makes that clear in the law, \nwhich is an improvement. \n \nI definitely want to thank Administrator Armstrong, who worked tirelessly during the interim \non that committee, Bailey Bortolin of Legal Aid, and Holly Welborn of the American Civil \nLiberties Union.  I think we came up with some good legislation, and I hope your Committee \nwill consider moving forward with S.B. 376 (R1). \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 376 (R1).  Our final item on the agenda is public comment.  \nIs there anyone who would like to testify in public comment?  [There was no one.]  At this \ntime, I will close public comment.  This will conclude our meeting for today.

Committee rules and protocol were explained.]  I am going to take things \nout of agenda order because members are presenting in other committees right now.  I will \nopen the hearing on Assembly Bill 430.  Assemblywoman Brown-May has an extreme \ninterest in all things related to health and human services.  As a last-minute appointee, she \nspends a lot of time watching our Committee. \n \nAssembly Bill 430:  Revises provisions relating to disabilities. (BDR 39-1048) \n \nAssemblywoman Tracy Brown-May, Assembly District No. 42: \nI appreciate all the work this Committee has been doing.  We are pleased to be here to \npresent Assembly Bill 430.  With me today are Jessica Adams, Deputy Administrator with \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nthe Aging and Disability Services Division of the Department of Health and Human Services, \nand Ace Patrick, Chair of the Nevada Statewide Independent Living Council.  We are \nworking to raise awareness about the importance of using preferred words and phrases to \nrefer to people with disabilities and to update our Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS).   \n \nAs I testified in another committee a few days ago, the meanings of words change over time.  \nAs society evolves, we must also make changes to reflect that evolution.  In this session of \nthe Legislature, we have considered several bills intended to raise awareness and improve \nequality.  I know that you have already heard a bill brought by our minority leader which is a \njoint resolution to affect the changes in our Constitution.  The words and the labels we use in \nstatute can have a profound effect on people.   \n \nThis bill was first discussed during the interim, as the Statewide Independent Living Council \nmembers identified the use of the \"R\" word that continued to exist in Nevada Revised \nStatutes (NRS).  While the reference is to an association, that association does not exist in \nNevada today, and we are working to eliminate that outdated language.  There are also \nreferences in NRS Chapter 435 that are inaccurate and offensive to people with diverse \nabilities.  At this time, I would like to turn the presentation over to Jessica Adams, who will \nwalk us through bill.  When she has completed that, we will turn it over to Ace Patrick, who \nwill give us a perspective of what it is like being a member of the disability community. \n \nJessica  Adams,  Deputy  Administrator,  Community  Based  Care  and  Development \nServices,  Aging  and  Disability  Services  Division,  Department  of  Health  and \nHuman Services: \nAssembly Bill 430 revises obsolete terms and phrases within NRS Chapter 435 regarding the \ncare and services provided to persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities.  The \nproposed changes will align the language used in NRS Chapter 435 with the language and \nphrases already used within developmental services and the community.   \n \nSection 1 revises NRS 435.060 to describe the transition of a person residing in a residential \nfacility for groups to a nonfacility-based setting from being able to live in a \"more normal \nsituation\" to being able to reside \"in an appropriate community-based setting that is not \na facility.\"  Section 2 revises NRS 435.115 to remove the reference to the State Association \nfor  Retarded  Citizens  and  the  board,  as  this  organization  no  longer  exists  in  Nevada.  \nAs Assemblywoman  Brown-May  mentioned,  that  is  an  offensive  term  now.    It  will  be \nchanged to reflect that the fee schedules will be established by the Administrator of Aging \nand Disability Services subject to the approval of the Director of the Department of Health \nand Human Services.  Section 3 revises NRS 435.130 to update the declaration of legislative \nintent  for  jobs  and  day  training  services.    This  will  change  the  purpose  of  jobs  and \nday training  services  for  people  with  intellectual  and  developmental  disabilities  from \nproviding services to \"help them become useful citizens\" to providing jobs and day training \nservices to \"increase independence.\"  This bill has no fiscal note.  All of these changes align \nNRS Chapter 435 with terms and phrases that are already used within the developmental \nservices field on a daily basis and represent current terminology as well as the respectful \nlanguage deserved by the people whom we serve. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nAce Patrick, Chair, Nevada Statewide Independent Living Council: \nThank you for the opportunity to provide some background information about the importance \nof our words.  Since the late 1960s, there has been an evolving movement toward \"person-\nfirst\" language.  It originated in Sweden and began to be incorporated into the United States \nwith some historical acts within the United States Constitution.  Now it is the accepted \nterminology of the American Psychological Association (APA) that further translates into \nmost government acts such as the ADA [Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990] and the \nIDEA [Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 2004].  It only makes sense that \nNevada ensures our language in statute follows suit.   \n \nThe purpose behind person-first language emphasizes the individuality, equality, and dignity \nof people with disabilities by maintaining that an individual is a person first and foremost, \nand that traits and medical conditions do not define who he or she is but are rather simply \nthat—a trait or medical condition.  Using person-first language reduces social stigmas and \nprovides a frame of reference that places all people in the same category before introducing \nany other aspects to be considered.  Although not every person agrees with person-first \nlanguage, it generally invokes mutual respect and is appreciated by most of the disability \ncommunity.    As  the  chair  of  the  Nevada  Statewide  Independent  Living  Council,  I  am \nspeaking on behalf of the Council when I say that Nevada still chooses to educate and inform \nany and all who may question the purpose or meaning behind this movement and supports \nperson-first and respectful language options for people with disabilities.   \n \nThe most important thing to remember when considering person-first language is that it \nreplaces antiquated and offensive terminology that has no business in Nevada language.  \nWords do matter.  In my experience, I can testify that for years I felt like a farm animal being \nherded by doctors, psychiatrists, and institutions while they used my diagnoses as labels to \npush me through to the next provider.  I do not think these professionals started to see me as \na person until the paradigm began to change.  Suddenly, I became a person with autism, \na person with hearing loss, a person with blindness, a person with a neurological disorder.  \nMy life changed dramatically when professionals began to address me about my diagnoses \nand not talk to each other about my diagnoses as if I did not even exist.  It may not seem like \nit matters to people who have never had to remind others they are in the room, but I can tell \nyou that it has made an enormous impact on the quality of my life.   \n \nI  am  a  person  with  disabilities,  and  I  support  these  important  changes  proposed  in \nAssembly Bill 430.  I want to thank the Committee for bringing it forward.   \n \nAssemblywoman Brown-May: \nThat is the crux of our position and our presentation.  As you can see, the words we are \nworking to eliminate are words that isolate us from each other.  We are trying to eliminate \nthe  misunderstanding  that  exists.    We  focused  on  three  words.    The  first  is  \"normal.\"  \nAccording to everything I have been taught, normal is nothing more than a setting on my \ndryer and should not be used when describing people.  We focused on the word \"retarded,\"  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nwhich is a diagnostic term that should not be used to describe people.  To insinuate that we \nare helping people to become \"more useful\" is just insulting.  Those are the three terms we \nare focusing on eliminating with this bill.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any questions?   \n \nAssemblyman Hafen: \nThere  have  been  other  bills  and  resolutions  to  clean  up  obsolete  language  that  is  not \nappropriate today.  I know there is a national association called The Arc.  Would the changes \nhave any effect on interaction with The Arc? \n \nAssemblywoman Brown-May: \nThe Arc is a national affiliate organization.  At one time, there was an affiliate here in \nNevada.  That currently does not exist.  Changes in this bill would not preclude its operation \nin the state.  If there were an advocacy organization that was so intended, it could nationally \naffiliate with The Arc of the United States.  I know the leaders of the Aging and Disability \nServices Division [within the Department of Health and Human Services] would be very \nhappy to work with The Arc.  Currently, The Arc is not involved in the fee-setting schedule \nin Nevada, so it would not have any impact here at all.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAssemblyman Hafen, do you have any follow-up questions?   \n \nAssemblyman Hafen: \nI do not. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any other questions or comments from Committee members?  [There were none.]  \nMay we have testimony in support of Assembly Bill 430? \n \nTroy Friden, Chief Operations Officer, Chrysalis: \nChrysalis provides services for over 220 people in Nevada with intellectual disabilities in \nsupportive living arrangements and/or jobs and day training settings.  I want to voice my \nsupport for Assembly Bill 430.  This legislation will enhance the dignity of some of Nevada's \nmost vulnerable citizens by updating antiquated language in statute that is perceived as \ndemeaning and/or alienating.  It will ensure that NRS focuses on person-first ideology.  \nIt will also make the language in the NRS more compatible with federal regulations including \nthe Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) rule issued by the Centers for Medicare \nand Medicaid Services in 2014.  I am thankful for the state's commitment in serving this \nwonderful  population  of  citizens.    I  am  grateful  for  this  legislative  body's  ongoing \ncommitment to this population by considering legislation such as A.B. 430.  I also want to \nthank  Aging  and  Disability  Services  Division  Administrator  Dena  Schmidt  and  Deputy \nAdministrator Jessica Adams for their leadership and partnership with providers in serving \nindividuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities.   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nLisa Foster, representing State of Nevada Association of Providers: \nState of Nevada Association of Providers' (SNAP) organizations provide supportive living \narrangements, jobs and day training, and related supportive services throughout the state.  \nAssembly  Bill  430  moves  Nevada  statutory  language  into  the  modern  vernacular  for \nindividuals with an intellectual disability.  Removing the phrase, \"more normal situation\" in \nsection 1, to what we now have and what our providers offer, \"appropriate community-based \nsetting,\" demonstrates what is truly most helpful for the individuals SNAP serves.  We also \nappreciate the removal of the word \"retarded citizens\" from the statute in section 2 and the \nchange  to  \"increase  independence\"  from  \"useful  citizens\"  in  section  3.    The  terms  are \nantiquated and less than respectful.  We greatly appreciate Assemblywoman Brown-May for \nbringing this legislation forward.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe can go to our next caller in support.  [There was no one.]  Are there any callers in \nopposition to Assembly Bill 430?  [There were none.]  Do we have any callers in neutral?  \n[There were none.]  I will turn it back to Assemblywoman Brown-May for any closing \nremarks. \n \nAssemblywoman Brown-May: \nWe would like to thank you for your time and consideration of Assembly Bill 430.  We \nappreciate the time you have taken to hear it.  I know that our stakeholders are grateful.  \nI would like to thank Deputy Administrator Jessica Adams and everyone who has worked on \nthis bill.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI will close the hearing on Assembly Bill 430.  Some have asked if we could pass this today.  \nI will put this on for a work session on Monday [April 5, 2021].  Thank you, everyone on the \nCommittee, for your support of Assembly Bill 430.  This bill was inspired, in part, by the \nMinority Leader's [Assemblywoman Titus] Assembly Joint Resolution [1] we heard earlier in \nthe session.   \n \nWe  are  waiting  for  members  who  are  attending  other  meetings.    We  have  a  lengthy \npresentation on Assembly Bill 347.  We will take a short recess to provide time for members \nto return to our meeting for the work session. \n \nThe meeting is recessed [at 12:39 p.m.].   \n \n[The meeting was reconvened at 12:45 p.m.]  We have a quorum.  At this time, we will move \ninto our work session.  Our first bill is Assembly Bill 358.   \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nAssembly  Bill  358:    Enacts  provisions  to  improve  access  to  Medicaid  for  persons \nreleased from incarceration. (BDR 38-919) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \n[Patrick Ashton read from the work session document, Exhibit C.]  Assembly Bill 358 was \nheard on March 29, 2021.  This bill requires the suspension, rather than termination, of \neligibility for Medicaid of a person who is incarcerated.  The bill also requires the eligibility \nfor and coverage under Medicaid for a person who is released from incarceration to be \nreinstated or instituted, as applicable, as soon as possible upon release.  Under A.B. 358, \na person who is incarcerated and who was not eligible for Medicaid before being incarcerated \nor  whose  eligibility  for  Medicaid  has  been  terminated  must  be  allowed  to  apply  for \nenrollment in Medicaid up to six months before his or her scheduled release date.  Finally, \nthe bill requires the Director of the Department of Corrections to complete a Medicaid \napplication as soon as practicable after an offender is authorized to enroll in Medicaid if the \noffender may be eligible for Medicaid upon release. \n \nRichard  Whitley,  Director,  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services,  provided \na memorandum which follows up on questions raised during the bill hearing [Exhibit D].  \nThe memorandum was sent to members and is available on the Nevada Electronic Legislative \nInformation System. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre  there  any  questions?    [There  were  none.]    I  will  entertain  a  motion  to  do  pass \nAssembly Bill 358. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  PETERS  MADE  A  MOTION  TO  DO  PASS \nASSEMBLY BILL 358. \n \nASSEMBLYMAN HAFEN SECONDED THE MOTION.   \n \nAre there any comments on the motion? \n \nTHE MOTION PASSED.  (ASSEMBLYWOMAN BLACK VOTED NO.  \nASSEMBLYWOMAN BENITEZ-THOMPSON WAS ABSENT FOR THE \nVOTE.) \n \nI will take the floor statement myself.  The next bill on work session is Assembly Bill 273. \n \nAssembly Bill 273:  Revises provisions relating to mental health consortia for children. \n(BDR 39-355) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \n[Patrick Ashton read from the work session document, Exhibit E].  Assembly Bill 273 was \nheard on March 19, 2021.  This bill creates a statewide mental health consortium to represent \nexisting regional mental health consortia.  The bill prescribes the membership and duties of \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nthe statewide mental health consortium and allows the statewide mental health consortium \nand each regional mental health consortium to request the drafting of one legislative measure \nwithin the scope of the statewide or regional consortium, as applicable.  \nThere is an amendment from Dan Musgrove, on behalf of the Clark County Children's \nMental Health Consortium.  It proposes to amend subsection 4 of Nevada Revised Statutes \n433B.333 (section 2 of the bill, page 3, line 24 through 27) to:  (1) remove the requirement \nthat  the  Administrator  of  the  Division  of  Child  and  Family  Services  or  the  Deputy \nAdministrator of the Division serve as a member of the consortium; and (2) instead require \nthe  administrator  or  his  or  her  designee  to  serve  on  the  consortium.    The  proposed \namendment is attached.  \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any questions?  The amendment is posted on the Nevada Electronic Legislative \nInformation System.   \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI had concerns with this bill and the membership of the consortium.  I was concerned \nmembers could be able to sit on different committees, recognizing that the volunteer world is \nsomewhat limited and people with interests are limited.  I wondered about the capacity to fill \nthis board.  It is my understanding that has been clarified.  Since this is not a board that is \nappointed by the Office of the Governor, it does not interfere with some of the other roles \npotential  members  may  have.    I  wanted  to  make  sure  that  was  clear  on  the  record.  \nIt answered my concerns.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you.  I appreciate that you reached out to the bill sponsor and legal counsel to get that \nanswer.  Are there any other comments?  [There were none.]  I will entertain a motion to \namend and do pass Assembly Bill 273. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  PETERS  MOVED  TO  AMEND  AND  DO  PASS \nASSEMBLY BILL 273. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN TITUS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nDo we have any comments on the motion?  [There were none.] \n \nTHE MOTION PASSED.  (ASSEMBLYWOMAN BLACK VOTED NO.  \nASSEMBLYWOMAN BENITEZ-THOMPSON WAS ABSENT FOR THE \nVOTE.) \n \nI will assign the floor statement to Assemblywoman Gorelow.  That concludes our work \nsession.   \n \nAt this time, I will open the hearing on Assembly Bill 347.  Due to the complexity of this \nbill, the presentation will take longer than usual.  Additionally, I have given videoconference \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \naccess to certain stakeholders to testify on this bill in support, opposition, and neutral.  \nAssemblyman Orentlicher and I have made a coordinated effort to ensure we have a thorough \npolicy discussion about Assembly Bill 347.  We will have the main presentation; then we \nwill take testimony in support, opposition, and neutral.  I have allowed for key stakeholders \nto have an extended opportunity to testify in opposition.  Then I will open it again for \nquestions.  We will have questions after the main presentation, then testimony, then further \nquestions  from  members  for  key  stakeholders  available  to  answer  questions,  then \nan opportunity for Assemblyman Orentlicher and his presenters to respond.  This will lead to \na more fruitful conversation and debate about this policy.   \n \nI appreciate your reading this complex bill.  We tried to hold stakeholder informational \nmeetings  at  the  beginning  of  the  session.    Hopefully,  this  triggered  some  of  those  for \nmembers  not  familiar  with  the  health  care  world.    If  not,  this  will  probably  give  you \na broader knowledge base to be able to process the policy.   \n \nAssembly Bill 347:  Revises provisions related to health care. (BDR 38-541) \n \nAssemblyman David Orentlicher, Assembly District No. 20: \nI am here to present Assembly Bill 347, which includes two proposals to make our health \ncare system much fairer for patients, doctors, hospitals, and other providers of health care \n[Exhibit F].  Assembly Bill 347 will make health care fair for everyone and will make it more \naccessible for patients, especially minority and poor Nevadans who struggle now to get the \ncare they need.  I am joined by copresenters Joseph White, Jolette Goins, KC Christon, and \nAsia Duncan.   \n \nThis bill is for the Medicaid recipient who cannot find a primary care physician because we \ndo not pay doctors enough under our Medicaid program.  With this bill, Medicaid patients \nwill be able to get care sooner, in a doctor's office, rather than later, in an emergency \ndepartment when they are much sicker.  This bill is for doctors, hospitals, and other health \ncare providers who treat Medicaid recipients and lose money doing so because our Medicaid \nprogram underpays providers of health care.  This bill is for individuals who cannot afford to \npurchase health care insurance because premiums are too high.  This bill is also for people \nwho have health care insurance but cannot afford the deductibles or copayments when they \nseek care.  This bill is for workers who do not get wage increases because their employers \nmust spend more money funding employee health care benefits and less on salaries.  This bill \nis for small businesses that cannot afford to offer health care benefits because health care \npremiums are too high.  This bill is also for businesses that do provide health care insurance \nbecause the bill will reduce their health care costs and make them much more competitive \nwith  businesses  in  other  states.    This  bill  will  make  health  care  more  affordable  and \naccessible to the many Nevadans who struggle to get the health care they need today.   \n \nThe proposal is based on careful study and consultation with health economists and policy \nexperts across the country, including many of the stakeholders who participated in our \nworking group.  I want to give special thanks to Joseph White from Case Western Reserve \nUniversity, whom you will be hearing from, who developed the idea we are presenting in the \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nsecond part of A.B. 347; and to Natalie Johns, who has been working on this with me for \nthree months to get us to this stage.   \n \nWe have had a working group with stakeholders from across the spectrum—hospitals, other \nproviders, insurers, employers, unions, and patient advocates [page 2, Exhibit F].  We had \nformal meetings for the past two months and individual meetings since December, and we \nare continuing to meet with smaller groups to get their perspective.  Their input is in our \nconceptual  amendment  [Exhibit  G].    The  amendment  reflects  the  input  from  our \nstakeholders.  We were careful to make sure they had the framework for the bill two months \nago; one month ago, they received the actual language.  They received the final bill a couple \nof weeks ago.   \n \nOne motivation behind the bill is that Nevada Medicaid reimbursement rates have been too \nlow for too long [page 3, Exhibit F].  That is unfair to Medicaid patients because it impedes \naccess.  If you do not pay providers enough, they are reluctant to take care of Medicaid \npatients, so it is unfair to patients.  It is unfair to providers as well.  We undercompensate \nhospitals, physicians, and other caregivers.  It just is not fair.  It also results in cost shifting.  \nIf we underpay on the Medicaid side, doctors and hospitals are losing money; they must raise \ntheir reimbursement rates from privately insured patients to make up the difference, which \nraises health insurance premiums.  It is unfair to everybody when Medicaid underpays. \n \nOur private insurance payment system is too complicated [page 4].  There are too many \nnegotiations over rates.  Providers have to deal with multiple insurers, negotiating with each \none.  There is too much variation in rates.  We may pay $5,000 in one hospital, and we might \npay $30,000 in another hospital.  There is too little transparency in rates.  We do not know \nexactly what the negotiated rates are.  It is a mystery trying to figure out how much you are \ngoing to pay if you have ever looked at a hospital bill and tried to figure that out.  There is \ntoo much distortion of market forces.  In some markets, insurers have too much leverage; in \nother markets, hospitals do.  It would be nice to have a free market in health care, but we do \nnot because the market does not work in health care the way it is supposed to.  Some \nproviders are underpaid with Medicaid and even private insurance.  It is tough to make a go \nof it as a primary care doctor in many places.  Some providers are overpaid.  That causes our \nhealth care system to be far too expensive.   \n \nI will illustrate the problem of high health care costs.  In the United States, we spend \nabout $10,500 per person on health care [page 5].  The next-highest is Switzerland, which is \njust under 70 percent of what we pay—around $7,000 per person.  Germany is 57 percent \nof what we spend; Canada is under 50 percent of what we spend; Japan is 45 percent of what \nwe spend; and New Zealand is 37 percent of what we spend.  You get very good care in \nSwitzerland,  Germany,  Canada,  Japan,  and  New  Zealand.    We  are  overspending  on \nhealth care.  \n \nWhy are we spending so much?  Why are health care costs high [page 5]?  It is not because \nwe go to the doctor more often or spend more time in the hospital.  We actually go to the \nhospital less often and spend less time in the hospital.  We do not see doctors as often as in \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nJapan or other countries.  It is not because we are sicker.  On average, there is less overall \nsickness in the United States than Western European countries.  That is because we have \na younger population, and we do not smoke as much as Europeans.  It is not because we are \nmore litigious.  We may be more litigious, but the cost of the tort system accounts for less \nthan 1 percent of our health care costs.  That is not the reason.  The reason our costs are \nhigher is because our prices are higher.  You can get an MRI in Japan for $150; here, it is \n$1,500.  The reason our prices are higher is because we rely on insurance companies rather \nthan the government to negotiate.  The reason all these other countries, except Switzerland, \nhave lower health care costs than we do is the government negotiates the prices.  The \ngovernment is a much better negotiator than insurance companies.   \n \nPage  7  of  Exhibit  F  is  an  illustration  of  the  difference  in  cost  between  having  an \nappendectomy in Nevada and having one in Taiwan.  If you look at the horizontal, flat blue \nline at the bottom of the graph, this is the cost of an appendectomy in Taiwan.  You notice it \ndoes not matter where in Taiwan you are—it is the same price, about $2,500.  If you have \nyour appendix removed in Nevada, the best price is $3,500, 42 percent higher than in \nTaiwan.  The cost goes up from there.  Whether you are in the north or the south makes a big \ndifference.  According to the Public Employees' Health Benefits Plan negotiated rates in \nNevada for state employees, the highest price is almost $48,000, 1,800 percent higher than in \nTaiwan.  This makes no economic sense.  It is not because this $47,000 appendectomy is a \nbetter appendectomy; it may be worse.  There is a poor correlation between quality and cost \nin the United States.  We should be where Taiwan is, and no hospital in Nevada is where \nTaiwan is. \n \nThe goal of Assembly Bill 347 is to ensure providers are paid fairly for both publicly and \nprivately  insured  patients  [page  8].    Fair  compensation  is  what  this  bill  is  about—no \nundercompensation and no overcompensation.  We want to protect against excessive charges \nto patients.  That is a real problem in our country and in our state.  We want to simplify the \nhealth care payment system because it is hopelessly complex.  Nobody really knows what the \ncosts are.  Hospital executives do not know what their hospital pricing is.  We also want to \npreserve vital private market virtues.  I majored in economics in college; I believe in markets.  \nI want to have a market, but sometimes we have market failures.  When the market fails, the \ngovernment must step in and correct it.  This bill will decrease the administrative burdens.  \nYou have probably heard about all the paperwork providers have to deal with.  A big reason \nfor that is because they have to deal with different insurers with different rates.  We can \nsimplify this in very important ways. \n \nHere are the principles involved [page 9].  The first is fairness.  Ultimately, we want a system \nthat is fair for everybody.  We make it fair by raising Medicaid reimbursement rates to \naddress the unfair underpayment to doctors and other health care providers.  It is not fair to \nunderpay  them.    On  the  private  insurance  side,  we  set  physician  and  hospital  fees  so \nproviders can cover their costs and earn a fair and reasonable profit.  That is a very important \nobligation—they need to cover their costs and earn a fair and reasonable profit.  We just do \nnot want them to earn excessive profits.  There will be no gouging of patients.  The second \nprinciple is simplicity.  If the state, instead of insurers, is setting fees, we would no longer \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nhave the complicated and inefficient system of rate negotiations between health insurers and \nhealth care providers.  We would have one set of rates like Medicare does for people who are \nover age 65.  It is much simpler; everybody understands what the rules are.  Patients can \nknow what they are paying; providers can know what they are going to earn.  If we set fees at \na fair level, we can have a system that works for everybody.  The bill will instruct the rate-\nsetting commission to use Medicare rates as a starting point.  From there, in situations where \nMedicare underpays, the rate-setting commission can raise the rates to fair rates.  It is \nimportant to start with Medicare rates because that is the best we have.  In estimating the real \ncosts for doctors and hospitals to deliver care, Medicare has by far the best data.  Nobody \ncomes close.  If somebody can show me a better set of data, we will put it in the bill, but \nthere is nothing that is better than Medicare.  It is very carefully thought through.  It is not \nperfect but asking the commission to start from scratch would make no sense.  It would be \nlike if you wanted to buy a house.  You could hire an architect and contractor and start from \nscratch on an empty lot, but it is a lot easier to buy a house that is out there already that may \nbe 90 percent of what you want.  Medicare gets to about 90 percent of a fair rate.  For that \nfinal 10 percent, maybe you need to repaint the house or redo a bathroom.  That is a lot more \nsensible than starting from scratch.  That is what we want this rate-setting commission to do.  \n \nThere are two parts to the bill.  I will now start going through the provisions of the bill.  \nPart 1 is the provider tax [page 10].  We want to raise Medicaid payments to Medicare levels.  \nI know we have a tight budget.  Where are we going to find money to raise Medicaid \nreimbursement rates?  What we do with skilled nursing facilities and what other states do \nwith other health care providers is say to providers, If you let us impose a tax on you, we \nwill more than triple what you give us.  They must think about that return on investment.  \nTriple what they pay is guaranteed; it is not speculative.  We will follow the model from \nSenate Bill 509 of the 79th Session.  The bill does not mandate the tax.  It tells providers if \nthey like the idea of giving us $1 and getting $3 back, they can vote on it.  If two-thirds of \nhospitals agree, there will be a hospital tax.  If two-thirds of doctors vote for it, there will be \na doctor tax and they will triple their money.  That is how that works.  The benefits include \nfairer treatment of patients and providers because with the increased dollars we can raise \nMedicaid reimbursement rates to fair levels—to what Medicare pays.  It will reduce the need \nfor cost shifting to private insurance.  \n \nWe have some guardrails in section 7 of the bill [page 11].  The dollars from the tax must be \nused to supplement, rather than replace, Medicaid dollars from the State General Fund.  \nIt will  not  be  possible  now  that  we  have  this  new  source  of  funding  for  us  to  say  as \na Legislature, We will just reduce our General Fund contributions to Medicaid.  We cannot \ndo this.  We have to maintain our existing funding of Medicaid.  This is to add on to what we \nare currently funding.  If funds remain at the end of the fiscal year, if we overestimate the tax \nor underestimate how much has to be paid out, the funds will carry over to the next fiscal \nyear and not return to General Fund spending.  The money can only be used to increase \nreimbursement rates for providers.  In the conceptual amendment we have added provisions \nto say that if the Legislature changes the allocation of funds or tries to divert funds, the \nproviders will be allowed to revote on whether they want to continue with the provider tax.   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nThat is the first part—getting Medicaid reimbursement to the Medicare levels.  The second \npart is the rate-setting [page 12, Exhibit F].  We have to increase the Medicaid rates to be \nfair.  In some situations, we must lower provider fees.  The principle is to cover reasonable \ncosts plus fair and reasonable profit.  Every provider will get fair compensation under this \nbill.  Ultimately, that is the right thing to do, to make sure everybody gets paid fairly.  That \nmeans primary care doctors who have been squeezed by insurance and are not paid enough \neven on the private side will be able to maintain their practices and not have to sell out to \na hospital or private equity firm.   The rate-setting commission is required to meet this \nstandard of covering costs and a fair and reasonable profit.  It is not an option.  To avoid \nduplication of efforts, they will start with Medicare and adjust from there, to make sure we \ndo not reinvent the wheel in Nevada when somebody else has put time and hard work into \nfiguring out how to get close to fair compensation.  The providers who think the Medicare \nrates are unfair—as I said, on average, Medicare comes close to paying about 90 percent of \nhospital costs—can come in and say, Here is where Medicare is underestimating what we \nneed to cover costs and reasonable profit.  Just show us the books, and we will adjust \naccordingly.   \n \nAn independent commission will set the rates.  In the original proposal, we were going to \nhave  it  done  by  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services,  but  feedback  from \nstakeholders persuaded us it makes more sense to do it as an independent commission, so that \nis in the conceptual amendment.  A broad range of stakeholders will participate, and there \nwill  be  representation  from  Health  and  Human  Services.    Examples  of  factors  the \ncommission will use in setting rates will include the payer mix.  Some providers see more \nMedicaid patients, some see more private patients.  To cover costs overall and get a fair and \nreasonable profit, some providers will need a higher reimbursement rate.  Disparities between \nprimary care and specialty services will be addressed.  For a long time, we have underpaid \nprimary care physicians.  That makes it difficult to have good access to a primary care \nphysician, so we want to address that to make sure they are compensated fairly.  And some \nspecialties are underpaid with respect to others; we want to fix that.  We want to reward \nquality of care and efficiency of services so that will be considered.  Some providers have \nseen a sicker population of patients.  It costs them more to do that, so that should affect their \nreimbursement.  We want hospitals and providers to have a population health focus.  Under \nour current system, you often lose money trying to prevent disease and maintain the health of \nyour population.  We want to reward that so people will invest more in population health.  \nThere could be financial hardship from reducing rates because even if people have been \noverpaid, they have built their system on that basis so we do not want to phase in changes \nthat would cause financial hardship.  We want to protect the workforce and quality jobs.  \nIf hospitals must reduce costs to reach a fair reimbursement, we want to make sure they do \nnot take it out on their workers.   \n \nCovering reasonable cost plus fair and reasonable profit—we are not there yet.  This bill is \nimportant because there are providers who earn more than a reasonable profit.  We have data \non  short-term,  acute,  general  care  hospitals—the  hospitals  where  you  would  go  to  the \nemergency department when you are sick or would go to for heart surgery.  The graph on \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \npage 13 [Exhibit F] is data from most of the major general care hospitals in our state.  As you \ncan see, the profit margin ranges from a low of 1 percent—that is too low, that should come  \nup—to a high of 23 percent—that is too high.  I do not know exactly what the right number \nis, but it is not in this part of the graph.  We have a way to go to get to covering reasonable \ncosts and earning a fair profit.   \n \nWhat will be the impact on the private insurance market when we adopt rate regulation \n[page 14]?  We get lower premiums because we are going to have fair costs, not excessive \ncosts.    Fair  pricing  will  lower  premiums,  and  we  will  have  greater  competition  in  the \ninsurance market because it will be easier for new health insurance companies to come in and \noffer plans because, right now, insurers have to create networks based on price discounting.  \nThey say to doctors, If you want us to send our patients to you, you must give us discounts.  \nWith the state setting rates, there will not be any need for price discounting.  In fact, price \ndiscounting will be prohibited because we have to protect doctors from insurers that try to \ndrive below the fair rate.  We will have greater competition in the insurance market that helps \nlower premiums.   \n \nIt will be similar to the Medicare Advantage program.  Medicare Advantage is the private \ninsurance side of Medicare.  You can go into traditional Medicare where you sign up and just \ngo to any doctor.  Traditionally, the doctor bills Medicare.  Or you can have Medicare pay \nyour premium for a private insurance plan.  That is a very robust market.  When I put in my \nZIP Code for Medicare Advantage, there were 10 or 11 insurance companies with over \n40 plans.    What  is  important  about  it  is  Medicare  Advantage  plans  all  use  a  common \nreimbursement  structure.    They  are  not  required  to,  but  they  do.    They  all  follow  the \nMedicare fee schedule.  Even though they do not negotiate rates with doctors, they are able to \ncompete with each other and have a very active, thriving market.  The private insurance \nmarket will do very well under this plan as it does in the state of Maryland where they have \nsignificant rate regulation.   \n \nI covered some of the conceptual amendments.  We have some others [page 15].  We will \nremove hospitals from the provider tax provisions because they are already in Senate Bill 509 \nof the 79th Session.  Probably the most important part of the conceptual amendment is if \nphysicians  or  other  providers  opt  for  the  provider  tax.    That  will  freeze  the  medical \nmalpractice noneconomic damages cap at $350,000.  Medicaid rates will be raised to the \nUpper Payment Limit.  We say, \"Medicare rates,\" but should more properly say, \"Upper \nPayment Limit\" to conform to Medicaid rules.  If there is not a Medicare rate, the average \ncommercial  reimbursement  would  be  used.    That  is  a  small  tweak.    The  rate-setting \ncommission will publicly disclose all rates.  We need transparency where we have opacity \nright now.  The amendment would provide more time for the rate-setting process in Year 1; \nwe had a short time frame in the bill.  Especially for the first year, the new rate-setting \ncommission will need time to get up to speed.  We will also add the provision to protect \nworkforce and quality jobs.  \n \nTo sum up, A.B. 347 will improve access to health care for Medicaid recipients [page 16].  \nIt encourages more Nevada physicians to see Medicaid patients.  More care will take place in \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nphysicians' offices; less will take place in emergency departments.  It provides simplification \nfor providers and insurers.  It reduces complicated, difficult negotiations between providers \nand payers, which is a hassle and a headache for everyone.  Providers will not have to \nmanage different rates for different payers.  It will increase provider supply in Nevada.  By \nraising Medicaid reimbursement to Medicare levels, Nevada will become a more attractive \nstate in which to practice, not to mention freezing the medical malpractice noneconomic \ndamages.  It reduces health care premiums [page 17, Exhibit F].  With increases in Medicaid \nreimbursement, there is less of a need for providers to shift costs to private-pay insurance.  \nRate-setting will protect against excessive charges.  That means it will lower the costs to the \nstate budget because a big cost to the state budget is the health insurance cost for state \nemployees.  It will be a substantial savings to the state's budget, far greater than the cost of \nsetting up this independent commission.  It will target regulation of market failure.  I majored \nin economics; I believe in markets, but sometimes the market does not work properly.  We \nhave been waiting over 40 years for the market to fix itself in health care.  It has not; it will \nnot.  We need the government to come in and correct the market failures.  This bill does so \nwithout the heavy hand of overregulation.   \n \nJoseph White, Ph.D., Private Citizen, Cleveland, Ohio \nI am the Luxenberg Family Professor of Public Policy at Case Western Reserve University.  \nI am not one of your constituents, but I have been coming to Nevada since 1972.  My sister \nmoved there in 1971, and she is a constituent of Assemblywoman Anderson.  She is dual \neligible for Medicaid and Medicare.  I care about her Medicaid.   \n \nThank you for the opportunity to testify on behalf of this legislation, which would directly \naddress the problem of costs of medical care in a way that no other state has attempted, but \nthat is also normal in other rich democracies.  I want to point out I did not develop this idea.  \nI have written more about it than most U.S. health policy scholars have, but I have written \nentirely from observation of what other countries do.  What we are talking about here is \nsomething that is essentially the main way costs are controlled in most other countries \ncompared to the United States. \n \nI would like to emphasize a few points in support of Assemblyman Orentlicher's presentation \nand would be happy to elaborate by responding to questions.  The United States, as he \nshowed, has the highest medical care costs per capita in the world.  I want to emphasize that \nwe are unusual for our coverage problems, covering roughly 90 percent of our population \ninstead of 100 percent, but we are more unusual for our costs.  Our costs, as a share of our \neconomy, are about 50 percent higher than anywhere else in the world.  We are in the range \nof 18 percent of our economy, compared to 12 percent in Switzerland.  In this way, the costs \nare a more impressive problem compared to other countries.  It also means that health care is \nless affordable even for middle-class persons who, by American standards, are well insured.  \nIf you are thinking in terms of what the big problem is for your voters, the bigger problem for \nyour voters is the cost of health care for people who have insurance, not the cost of health \ncare  for  people  who  do  not.    The  unaffordability  of  health  care  for  people  who  have \ninsurance is a major crisis in the United States, and it is getting worse all the time.   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nThe question is, Why are our costs so high?  There have been various theories over the years, \nmost emphasizing the volume of care and unnecessary care.  Any comparison to other \ncountries makes it clear that the U.S. pays more because our prices are higher; and prices are \nhigher, in part, because our insurance system generates much higher administrative costs that \nare incorporated into physician and hospital costs.  And, in part, the cost of insurance \npremiums is related to the same administrative costs.  The problem is not only that prices are \nhigh, but they are extremely varied.  This means insurers and medical care providers have \nextra costs; first, in keeping track of all the different prices in all the different contracts, and \nsecond, in negotiating all the different prices in all the different contracts.  \n \nAs an example, I was once giving a talk in Paris about the American health care system.  \nI said that the Cleveland Clinic had 1,600 doctors.  Everyone went, \"Ooh, aah.\"  Then I said \nit had 2,000 billing clerks.  People looked at me in bewilderment.  Why would you need \n2,000 billing clerks?  That is the kind of variation that has been going on.  There are various \nestimates of the excess costs associated with our billing and payment system.  They have to \nbe at least 5 percent of total spending and probably much more.  In my written testimony \n[Exhibit H], I provide links to various sources on all this.   \n \nThe variation in prices is also a severe problem.  The U.S. system for establishing prices \ninvolves wide variation in what each hospital charges to different payers—either insurers or \nindividuals—for the same services, such as a colonoscopy; huge differences in what different \nproviders charge to the same payer; and the surprise medical billing in which we can go to \na hospital that is in-network and get a huge out-of-network bill from an anesthesiologist or \nemergency room physician or other provider who does not work for the hospital.  It is \nimportant to emphasize that if prices are standardized in the way A.B. 347 would create, \nsurprise bills would disappear.  Moreover, so would the incentives to create narrow networks.  \nThe main reason for narrow networks is as a bargaining technique for insurers:  they seek \nlower prices from providers by threatening to exclude physicians or hospitals from the \n\"covered lives\" insurers provide for them.  The much higher prices in the United States show \nthat  this  \"selective  contracting\"  does  not  work  very  well;  but  it  creates  confusion  and \ndifficulty for patients who just want to go to the doctor or hospital and get help without huge \nexpense.    It  is  hard  to  overstate  the  irritations  and  hassles  associated  with  the  narrow \nnetworks and the uncertainty about what is covered and what is not; whose care is covered \nand whose care is not.  \n \nAssembly Bill 347 would create a version of what is called an \"all-payer” system.  In an \nall-payer system there are multiple insurers, but all or most pay each provider by the same \nrules.  This simplifies billing and payment.  It accomplishes most of the savings that could be \nassociated with a single-payer system, or so-called \"Medicare for all.\"  There are versions of \nall-payer systems in many countries, such as Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, \nand Switzerland.  It is also how Medicare Advantage works.  Private Medicare Advantage \ninsurers pay hospitals' Medicare prices.  This was not something this bill tried to do, but it \ndid it by accident because the law requires that providers outside a Medicare Advantage \nplan's  network  charge  the  standard  Medicare  fees  for  out-of-network  care,  to  protect \nMedicare beneficiaries in case they have to go out of network.  Because the out-of-network \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nplans have to accept Medicare fees, there is no reason for an insurer to contract with an \nin-network plan and pay more than Medicare fees, so they basically pay the Medicare fees.  \nAs Assemblyman Orentlicher showed, there is a lot of market competition between insurers \nin  Medicare  Advantage.    Basically,  A.B.  347  proposes  that  Nevada  set  prices  with \nindependent insurers in a way that already applies to over 60 million Medicare beneficiaries, \n24 million of whom are in Medicare Advantage plans.   \n \nIt takes the simplest approach to setting rates:  start with Medicare's rules and then deviate if \nthe physician group or hospital can make a reasonable case.  For example, as in Medicare \nand its  indirect  medical  education  expenses  and  its  disproportionate  share  of  hospital \npayments, there may be arguments that a hospital has extra costs from teaching or from \na disproportionate share of uninsured patients.  If the Medicare extra payment is not enough, \nthat may justify higher fees.  Providers will argue that Medicare payments are inherently \ninadequate.  That is probably because they make their costs fit whatever money they can get.  \nThey have a great deal of market power to get money for all sorts of things, some of which \nmany of us would not think are useful, like some of the salaries for administrators.  One \nshould be skeptical about the claims for Medicare payments being inadequate for a few \nreasons.    The  Medicare  Payment  Advisory  Commission  analyzes  payment  adequacy \ncarefully.  You can look at the methodology in Chapter 2 of their annual reports on Medicare \nPayment Policy.  The most recent report came out a few weeks ago.  The proposed payment \nreform should substantially reduce hospitals' and medical groups' costs, through the savings \nfrom simplification of billing.  The proposed payment reform would increase income through \nraising Medicaid fees to the Medicare levels.  While some would come from the provider tax, \nmore would be from a new federal subsidy due to the Medicaid matching percentage.  Even \nif right now the Medicare payments are lower than they should be, which the Medicare \nPayment Advisory Commission would deny, it remains the case that there will be substantial \nsavings to providers and new income to providers from this bill.  The Medicare payments \nwould have to be off by some meaningful amount for them to be actually inadequate.   \n \nNobody should imagine that any reform will work perfectly, but the approach used for \nA.B. 347 is straightforward and relatively simple.  We should remember that versions of \nall-payer rate-setting have been implemented successfully around the world.  Most other \nproposals for controlling health care costs involve far less positive experience and evidence.  \nI could direct you to what was in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and what \nthe health care policy wants being proposed over the years.  None of them has a track record \ncomparable to the record of administrative simplification and rate-setting simplification we \nsee in other countries with all-payer rate-setting.  Thank you for your consideration, and I am \nhappy to try to answer any questions. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAssemblyman Orentlicher, are others here to be part of your presentation, or are they here for \nsupportive testimony? \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nJolette Goins, KC Christon, and Asia Duncan are here as part of the presentation. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nJolette Goins, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \nI would like to share a testimony of the strain our health care policies are for me personally.  \nMy interest in the bill is because of the hope that some of these things can be eradicated.  \nI am a senior and have a modest income.  I work three days a week and I get social security, \nbut I have health care from my job.  I pay what I think is a crazy amount of money for it, but \nwe must have health care.  After age 65, you are required to have Medicare, so I am covered \nby two insurances.  I thought this would be good.  I thought I would be able to take care of \nmyself and be healthy.  I went to the doctor and got a diagnosis.  They gave me a plan for \nrecovery, but I cannot afford to do the care because the deductibles are so outrageous.  When \nyou are choosing your insurance, they do not necessarily list all the deductibles.  You know \nyou are going to pay for office visits; you know you are sometimes going to pay for \ndiagnostic testing and things.  That is okay, but when you go and get a diagnosis and they tell \nyou this is what it is going to take to get you in a better place and then you find out that you \nhave to pay this deductible before you can get the work done.  This has happened to me more \nthan once.  It is very frustrating when you feel like you have taken the right steps, you have \ntaken the right precautions, but at the end of the day you still cannot do the things necessary \nto have the ultimate for yourself health-wise.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre you finished with your testimony?   \n \nJolette Goins: \nI believe so.   \n \nAsia Duncan, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \nI am a small business owner.  Today I come before you because it is difficult to pay for \nhealth insurance, not just for myself as an individual, but even small group health care plan \noptions for my team are expensive and unsustainable for my business at this time.  Health \ncare  accessibility  and  affordable  health  care  coverage,  in  my  opinion,  are  essential  to \nindividual's and families' overall health and wellness.  I care about the individuals who work \nfor me, and I care about their families.  I would love to be able to make health care options \navailable to them, but I do not want to affect my business's ability to profit.  The average \nannual premium for small group health plans are roughly $3,500 to $5,000.  On top of \nseveral other necessary and mandatory insurance coverages that I am required to have, it was \nnot a feasible option to add health care.  Individually, my premium is around $4,000 a year.  \nI went to the marketplace and shopped around to find the best policy and coverage for my \nfamily and me, but I am still paying $4,000 a year.  Health insurance for me is just one of \nthose \"in the event of an emergency\" situations because I practice a healthy lifestyle and \nhealthy  living.    Some  people  who  work  for  me  have  preexisting  conditions  and  other \nlife-altering illnesses.  When I talk to them about health care, they often tell me that if I pay \nthem too much, they will not qualify for Medicaid.  I do not understand how Medicaid relates \nto pay raises.  I always thought it was a good thing to get pay raises, but some of them do not \nwant them because they want to maintain their Medicaid.   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nI hope my testimony today will allow legislators to consider lowering the cost of health care \noverall for small groups and small health care plans and for individuals and people like me. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIs there another testifier? \n \nKC Christon, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada:  \nI would like to talk about the families that I serve.  I work for Acelero Learning, a Head Start \nprogram.  We serve children six weeks of age to pre-kindergarten.  We deal with a lot of \nfamilies from diverse backgrounds.  The pattern I am seeing is the challenge for these parents \nto  have  and  obtain  health  care.    When  they  do  have  health  care,  the  system  is  quite \nchallenging to navigate.  If a simplified way of providing health care is available, that would \nbe beneficial to members of the community.  There is a lot of reading and the terminology—\nfolks are having a challenging time understanding what it means and interpreting what it \nmeans and what happens if they do this or do not do this.  They come to me.  I am their first \nstop.  I work with their children at the school, so I get a lot of questions and find myself \ndoing a lot of research just to answer basic questions for the parents.  I can understand their \nfrustration because there was some time that I did not have health insurance myself.  Being \nable to navigate the Medicaid/Medicare system in Nevada is challenging.  I can only imagine \nwhat  these  parents  are  going  through  on  a  daily,  weekly,  monthly  basis  with  multiple \nchildren, some who have moderate health problems, some who have severe health problems.  \nThat is one of the things I would like to present to you today.  If that could be considered, \nI am sure that would be greatly appreciated. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAssemblyman Orentlicher, are there any remarks before we open for questions? \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nWe can go to questions. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nMembers of the Committee, please send your questions to me.  I will direct the questions to \nAssemblyman Orentlicher first, so we do not do a round robin where everyone has an answer \nfor the question.  He can direct questions to the most appropriate person.   \n \nAssemblyman Hafen: \nI appreciate the number of stakeholder meetings you had.  I participated in the working group \nwith you.  I know it has been difficult working virtually on such a complex bill, but I think \nyour passion to try to bring health care to all parts of our state is something we all agree \nupon.  I know there are a lot of moving parts in the building with a few other bills.  I know \nyou cosponsored other bills to help address some of the health care issues in bringing \nmedical professionals to the state.   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nHas there been any consideration of what is going to happen with the doctor shortage we \ncurrently have in relation to how this bill would be implemented?  Would we see an increase \nor a decrease?  Would this be seen as an attractive measure to bring additional medical \nprofessionals to the state? \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nI think this will do a lot to make Nevada more attractive.  The low payment on the Medicaid \nside is a perennial and serious irritant to physicians and other providers.  We do not pay them \nadequately, and they lose money.  Being able to tell them we pay at Medicare rates for \nMedicaid would be a huge benefit and would make this state more attractive.  They would \nnot have to deal with multiple insurers, not have to negotiate.  The number of billing clerks \nand other administrative staff that increases the cost of running a medical practice, that \nnumber would decrease, and they would be able to bring primary care reimbursement up.  \nRight now, if you are a pediatrician, an internist, or family doctor, it is hard to make a go of it \non your own.  You end up seeing more and more doctors becoming employed by hospitals or \nprivate equity firms.  It is much better for them if they can maintain their independent \npractices, and it is better for their patients.  I think there are a lot of benefits.  Having a freeze \non the noneconomic damages cap—doctors will love that when they are thinking about \nwhere to practice.  I think this will address the doctor shortage.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo you have any follow-up questions, Assemblyman Hafen? \n \nAssemblyman Hafen: \nI have additional questions, but I will let other members ask their questions and come back.   \n \nAssemblyman Matthews: \nI want to echo what Assemblyman Hafen said about your efforts in working on this bill.  You \nreached out to me, and I appreciated the opportunity to get together with you to talk about it.  \nYou covered a lot of ground and touched on some of this peripherally, but I hope we can zero \nin a bit more.  You talked about rates and rate-setting.  Who would set these rates?  How do \nwe ensure that a commission will be educated and informed enough to intelligently evaluate \nand consider all the relevant market variables and not be conflicted by outside influences in \nthat process? \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nThe commission would have a board with a wide range of stakeholders to make sure all \nvoices are represented and that insurers, providers, employers, workers, and patients are all \nthere to make sure their views are taken into account.  It will also have a staff of expert \nanalysts who can look at the data and figure out, as Medicare does now, what are fair costs \nand what is a fair profit.  We have seen, and as Professor White indicated, every other \ncountry has been able to do this.  We do it with public utilities using a similar model.  We do \nhave to properly staff it—both the people who do the data-crunching and the people who are \non the board.  There are good models out there, and I am interested in feedback in how to \ndesign it as well as possible.  Professor White might want to add comments. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nJoseph White: \nOne thing is an issue of how you think about what outside influences are.  The important \noutside influences are the people who are asking for more money, and they are going to try to \nuse influence to get more money.  I am not sure there are other outside influences that will \nplay on these kinds of things.  If you look at the questions of underlying costs, a lot of this \nstuff like geographic variations and rent and labor costs are already in the Medicare formulas \nfor hospitals.  Once administrative costs go down for providers, Medicare rates will be \ncloser, or more certainly adequate.  You need an appeals process and a way for providers to \nmake a claim that they are different for some reason.  It would probably work the way the \nappeals process for other bodies works.  We cannot be sure it will be perfect, but I think it \nshould be pretty good.  I also think we can be absolutely sure the providers with the market \npower to achieve or extort higher prices will say it is unfair.  We know that will happen.  \n \nAssemblyman Matthews: \nYou referenced experts.  An expert in one field is not necessarily an expert in another.  What \ndo you have in mind?  Are you talking about a combination of health care professionals, \nproviders, economists, and academics?  Experts will not necessarily agree.  Based on areas of \nexpertise, they may end up in conflict.  How do you see that playing out?  What fields would \nthese experts be drawn from?   \n \nJoseph White: \nPersonally, I would like accountants.  Some will claim their costs are higher for some reason.  \nI would like to see people who can assess the data used to make those claims.  I think there is \nan argument for having a variety of skills on these panels.  Assemblyman Orentlicher has \nthought more about that than I have.  You want a variety of skills and perspectives, but \nI think one substantial part of it is accounting.  Somebody is making a claim about costs.  Are \nthey telling you the truth?  Do they not understand their own costs?  Are the costs actually \nhigher than they are saying?  I think that is probably the most fundamental skill set here. \n \nAssemblyman Matthews: \nWould a cost-based rate system incentivize increased costs if it is structured that way?  How \nare we defining \"costs\"?  Who would be defining what those costs are under this bill? \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nThat is one of the risks—that people will try to inflate costs.  That is one of the advantages of \nstarting with Medicare, because Medicare does a lot of vetting already, of reasonable costs \nand unreasonable costs.  That is when we would have the expert staff—the accountants, \neconomists, and health policy people—put the burden on the providers to show that this is a \nreasonable cost.  It is not to cover all costs; it is to cover reasonable costs.  They will have to \njustify and prove the cost that Medicare does not cover actually is a reasonable cost.   \n \nThe other thing that is part of the rate-setting is rewarding efficiency.  Some providers and \nsome hospitals are more efficient than others.  The rate-setting commission will take that into \naccount because they will not look at just one provider, they will be looking at the full range  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nof providers to get a good sense of which are efficient and which are inefficient.  That is \nsomething they will consider.  The important thing is that Medicare is already doing this and \nhas been doing it for a long time, so we know it can be done in an effective way. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI have a question for you, Assemblyman Orentlicher.  In the amendment, you have a cap on \nnoneconomic medical malpractice damages if the provider group participates in the provider \ntax.  Will you give me the reasoning behind that?  In your presentation, you indicated \nmedical malpractice claims account for less than 1 percent of the cost.  Was this the result of \nconversations with stakeholders?  How did that amendment come about? \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nChange can be scary to people, even if it is the right thing to do.  When you propose \nsignificant change, people get nervous.  To provide reassurance that we are trying to do the \nright thing and to make this a more appealing opportunity for providers who are trying to \ndecide whether to vote for the provider tax, we added the protection on medical malpractice, \nwhich causes anxiety for them.  Anything we can do to provide reassurance that this is the \nright thing to do for them and that they and their patients will be better off, is helpful.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWhere did you get the data that said medical malpractice claims only represent a small \npercentage of health care costs?  Is that in our state?  Is that nationally?  Where did the \n1 percent number come from? \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nThat number is widely accepted national data.  I will try to find a particular source, but that is \nthe standard view of the total cost of the tort system.  People may ask about defensive \nmedicine.  It does not include defensive medicine; that is harder to pin down.  You can \nmeasure how much is spent on liability insurance and court cases.  That 1 percent is a pretty \ngood number.  Defensive medicine is in the minds of doctors, so some estimates may go to 3, \n4, or 5 percent.  Even if it does not cost you dollars to go to court, there is a psychological \ncost to having to defend yourself in a lawsuit.  That does not show up in the 1 percent of \neconomic costs.  \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThere are more questions from members. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nThe work you put into this bill is impressive.  I have been invited to many of the meetings \nand was able to sit in on a little of it.  I have questions about the data collection you \nreferenced.  The data would be used to determine payment amounts.  What data is currently \nbeing collected?  How would we have to modify the collection practice?  Where would the \ndata collection be hosted?   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nOne of the advantages of structuring it the way the bill does is they start with Medicare, and \nhospitals are already filing Medicare costs reports.  Medicare has already accumulated a lot \nof data.  The second part is that if providers think Medicare is not adequate, they can come \nbefore the commission.  They can ask to raise the rate by 5 percent, or 10 percent, or \nwhatever they think is right.  They may say it needs to be raised by 40 percent.  Then they \nhave the obligation to provide evidence and the data to support their claim.  The data will \ncome to the commission through the petition process because you cannot demonstrate you \nneed an increase in rates unless you show us your cost data, so it will inevitably follow from \nthe process. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nI am a data nerd and love technology, databases, and data management.  I am having this \nfantasy of a process in which we could use artificial intelligence to run an algorithm on data \ninput by these entities and leave the experts and people out of it after we oriented a process \nthat was amicable—a little science fiction for the Committee.  My other question has to do \nwith some of the data you presented related to the difference in cost between medical \nprocedures in the United States versus other countries.  Did those studies account for the \ndifference in the cost of living expenses in the United States?  Living costs here are different \nthan they are in Taiwan.  Would you explain how that is normalized? \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nAfter I finish, Professor White can provide more information.  I do not know about the cost \nof living in Taiwan.  I was planning to use Japan, but I had trouble getting the numbers from \nJapan.  Japan has a much higher cost of living, and their prices would not look that different \nfrom Taiwan's.  The cost of living does not explain the differences.  The major difference is \ngovernments negotiate.  You have a single negotiator on the purchaser side, the government.  \nThat is just how government negotiation works.  The government negotiating has more \nleverage than insurers.  We think of insurers as being big, bad, and powerful; but compared \nto a government, they do not have the same kind of negotiating leverage.  In a lot of \ncommunities, hospitals do.  If you are the only hospital in the community, or the Cleveland \nClinic, or the University of Texas MD Anderson Center, or a must-have hospital patients \nwant to have in their network, then they have a lot of negotiating leverage.  When the \ngovernment is negotiating on behalf of all patients, you get a different result.  That is why \nyou see the lower prices.  Japan has a much higher cost of living than we do, and their prices \nlook a lot like Taiwan's.   \n \nJoseph White: \nThere are even situations where the government does not set the prices.  In Germany, the \ninsurers get together.  The system is set up so they get together and negotiate, but it has the \nsame effect.  What you are doing is concentrating the market power among the insurers.  \nThat is a way that does not exist in the United States.  Although people complain about them, \nthe striking thing about American insurers is they are wimps.  They are bad at negotiating \nprices, partly because they have a choice.  They are middlemen.  On one side, they are \nnegotiating with individual employers who are small compared to them; on the other side, \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \nthey are negotiating largely with concentrated hospital networks.  In many communities, \nthere are three cardiac care groups.  They must make a choice.  Do they negotiate harder with \nthe people with whom they have less market power, the providers, or with their customers?  \nThe answer is it is easier for them to pass the providers' demands on to their customers.  \nWhat their market power means is that there are not that many insurers, so there are not many \nplaces for the customers to go.  Our insurers are weak.   \n \nOn the question of comparing costs, you cannot simply use exchange rates to turn the \nJapanese yen into dollars at the common exchange rate and make the comparison.  That is \nsomewhat indicative, but the fact is that there is only so much it gets you.  There are a lot of \nanalyses that have gone into greater depth.  One thing is to show the big difference in \npercentage  of  GDP  [gross  domestic  product]  because  gross  domestic  product  includes \neverything in the economy, so if we are at 18 percent and somebody else is at 11 or \n12 percent, then we really must be doing something more expensive.  If you look at what we \nare doing, it is prices, not volume.  Some of that is for drugs.  This does not really address \ndrugs, which is a different problem, but a major one.  The other side of it is there have been \npeople who tried to control for local costs of living.  Back in 2007 and 2008, McKinsey [the \nMcKinsey Global Institute] did a detailed study.  Their adaptation and estimates were based \non controlling for underlying cost of living differences to at least some extent.  They still \nfound the same basic story, which is that the difference in cost between the United States and \nother countries is due to prices and administrative costs.   \n \nIt is important to understand what spending less would mean.  On the one hand, probably on \naverage—not  in  every  country,  for  instance,  not  necessarily  for  nonhospital  doctors  in \nJapan—American doctors are paid more.  Doctors will have significantly lower costs because \nthey will not be paying all these administrative staff.  That means you can pay them lower \nfees, but they will end up ahead or at least equal.  If we are saying there is a lot of \nunnecessary billing work, then I admit we are saying there are some jobs that will have to go \naway—because if you have those 2,000 billing clerks at the Cleveland Clinic and you \nsimplify, there are job losses.  When you are doing your calculation of whether a hospital \nneeds more money, if the CEO is making $3 million, then maybe you do not want to \naccommodate that in the claim for more money.  So there are potential losers.  On the other \nhand, the winners will potentially be everybody else.   \n \nWhat we are talking about is a situation in which even people with good insurance are losing \nit.  The big beneficiaries of the non-Medicaid part of this plan—Medicaid is improved by \npaying higher rates so people with Medicaid can get better services—are the people who \nhave insurance through their employers.  As costs go down, insurance will be much more \naffordable for employers; the employers will have less need to cut benefits the way they have \nbeen doing that.  Currently, the increase in costs in the system has its biggest effect on people \nwho are getting insurance through their employers.  Most of the people who are getting it \nthrough Medicare—well, Medicare's prices are regulated.  For people who are getting it \nthrough Medicaid, it is a different problem.  The people getting it through the marketplaces,  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \ntheir premiums—if you are under 400 percent of the federal poverty level—are limited \nalready.  The big winners from controlling health care costs more effectively in the system \nare employers, including the State of Nevada. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nThank you for breaking that down a little more.  Calling someone a loser for reducing his or \nher annual pay from $2 million to something less does not seem like that big a loss to me \ncompared to someone not having to be buried for the rest of their life for a hospital bill \nbecause  their  child  fell  off  a  bike.    The  costs  and  benefits  balance  must  have  some \nperspective.  Thank you for those responses.   \n \nAssemblywoman Krasner: \nIf somebody breaks an arm and needs to go to an orthopedic surgeon, would the orthopedic \nsurgeon who is skilled and has been doing surgeries on broken arms for 20 years be paid the \nsame as an orthopedic surgeon who has been doing surgeries for 6 months? \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nWill  we  have  different  rates  for  different  providers?    Potentially.    The  bill  includes  a \nprovision to say quality of care should be taken into account.  I think that is a good idea.  \nThat said, quality-based payments do not have a very good track record.  It is a good concept \nin theory, but in practice we have found it has been difficult to adjust reimbursements based \non quality of care, although it has been tried for a long time.  The evidence is not good for its \neffectiveness, but the bill includes it.  If a provider could demonstrate that he or she is \nproviding a higher quality of care, that should be rewarded.   \n \nProfessor White said we may lose some positions for billing clerks.  Other employers who \nhave lower health care costs will be able to hire more workers.  I think that overall, we are \nlikely to get more people working when you lower health care costs.  If you lower the cost of \noperating the business, you can expand your business more quickly and hire more workers.   \n \nAssemblywoman Krasner: \nWould there be a way for a provider, a doctor, or a hospital to appeal the rate that was found \nto be applicable?   \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nYes, they could come in and say, We think we should have a higher rate.  They would get a \nresponse from the commission, and there would be an appeals process within the commission \nas there is within Medicare.  They could challenge and ask the commission to reconsider its \nresponse. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo you have any further questions, Assemblywoman Krasner? \n \nAssemblywoman Krasner: \nNo.   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank you, Assemblyman Orentlicher, for the presentation and the time and effort that you \nhave put into this bill.  This nationwide discussion has been going on for decades, and to \nsolve the nationwide problem in a couple hours' testimony is a heavy lift for anybody.  \nI believe these are conversations well worth having.   \n \nI would like to go to the bill itself and ask some questions pertaining to the bill, as opposed to \nthe concept of health care and its issues in our nation and worldwide.  The amendment you \nadded  plays  along  with  some  of  what  Chair  Nguyen  asked  regarding  section  6  of  the \nconceptual amendment about the provider groups.  If they choose to join the provider tax, \nwill there be a cap on the economic [noneconomic] damages?  I am curious about that \nchapter in Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS).  What will happen to providers who do not sign \non?  Will they face unlimited exposure?  Would you clarify that for me? \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nThe way the provider tax has to work under Medicaid rules is if you apply it to a class of \nproviders—hospitals are a class, physicians are a class, dentists are a class—you could \nsubdivide physicians and say, We only want pediatricians to come in or emergency doctors \nto come in.  There are paths to do that, but it is very difficult to do it that way.  Let us assume \nall doctors come in as a class.  That happens only if two-thirds of doctors in the state vote to \nassume the tax.  Then, Medicaid requires that everybody be in.  If you voted against it—if \nyou were one of the 30 percent who voted against it—you would still pay the tax.   \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nWhat  about  this  economic  [noneconomic]  damage  in  your  amendment  in  section  6, \nsubsection 5?  It talks about the noneconomic damages shall not be raised and applied to a \nprovider.  Is it on all providers in the group?  What about those who have not joined in a \ngroup, like me?  I was in private practice at one point in my career.  Would those be \nprotected under that? \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nIf physicians, as a class, choose the provider tax, then every physician in the state would get \nthe protection of the freeze on the noneconomic damages cap.   \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nUnder section 6, subsection 2, the bill talks about future legislators declaring they would not \nraise  the  maximum  amount  of  noneconomic  damages.    How  can  you  commit  a  future \nlegislative body to do something?  How can you put that in a statement?  We do not know \nwhat the next group makeup will be of this body.  We cannot commit the future legislative \nbody to what our decisions are today.  We can pass NRS, but they are free to change it.  I am \nworried this commits us to prevent future legislation.  Would you clarify that? \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 27 \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nYou are correct as a matter of legislative and constitutional principle.  We cannot bind future \nlegislatures.  That said, this would say to future legislatures that we passed this bill; it had \nmany parts.  It is an integrated whole.  If you start picking out one part, it is like unraveling a \nsweater when you start pulling on the thread, so that would be an inappropriate thing to do.  \nJust to make sure that you think twice about trying to do something like that, if you do that, \nthen section 6, subsection 6 of the amendment talks about how the Department of Health and \nHuman Services will have entered into a contract with the provider group as part of the \nprocess of imposing the provider tax.  If a future legislature raises the noneconomic damages \ncap, that will cancel the provider tax so that a future legislature would have to recognize that \nif they raise the noneconomic damages cap, they will have to start sending back tens of \nmillions of dollars to the federal government.  They will have to cut reimbursement rates to \nproviders who take care of Medicaid recipients.  And they will have to compromise access to \ncare for Medicaid recipients.  That is a price future legislatures will not want to pay.   \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI have lived in the real world of having an office practice, private practice, and working for \nthe hospital district.  I know that Medicare does not reimburse at cost now.  It is difficult \ngetting doctors to see Medicare patients.  Your concern is that it is even worse getting \ndoctors to see Medicaid patients because they pay at a lower rate.  Right now, in Nevada, \nMedicaid pays 95 percent of the Medicare rate.  At least that was the general reimbursement \nuntil we went into special session when we lowered Medicaid reimbursement an additional \n6 percent, but it looks like we will go back up on that.  Let us say Medicaid pays 95 percent \nof what Medicare pays.  We know Medicare does not pay for our cost of doing business.  \nI would see whoever walked through my office door.  The issue was not my seeing them.  \nThe issue was my getting them referred to a provider who would see a Medicaid patient.  \nI could not get them to see a Medicare patient.  Where are the private insurers going to go?  \nYou are obligating private insurance companies, too, not just Medicaid and Medicare.  We \nare talking about a global price control here.  You are going to obligate private insurers.  \nHow  will  that  encourage  anybody  to  practice  health  care  in  Nevada?    Although  your \nintention is to have providers see more patients, I have concerns this is going to do the \nopposite based on what this bill presents today.  I am anxious to hear some more discussion \non it, but I am very concerned about price-setting and how that will impact me as a provider \ngetting a patient whom I could not get seen for Medicare now, let alone getting them seen for \nMedicare in the future.  This may affect Medicaid rates and people who see Medicaid and \nMedicare patients.  For those who do not see these Medicaid and Medicare patients, is this \ngoing to force them to accept these same rates?  If so, will there need to be changes in federal \ngovernment regulations?   \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nI am confident that if doctors are promised they will be paid fair reimbursement for all of \ntheir patients—perhaps with Medicaid, not quite all the way, but pretty close—that overall, \nthey will receive fair reimbursement and will not have the hassle of dealing with negotiations \nwith  insurance  companies  and  they  will  have  extra  protection  against  liability  for \nmalpractice.  I think that is a pretty good deal.  I am not worried about the appeal of that to \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 28 \n \ndoctors around the country.  For the doctors who want to earn excessive reimbursement and \nmore than a fair income—I think we will lose some people like that.  From what I know \nabout doctors, from what I know from myself as a doctor, there are going to be more doctors \nwho will be attracted to Nevada than will want to earn excessive reimbursement.  Maybe that \nis not good for patients, having doctors like that who care so much about how much they earn \nthat a fair profit is not adequate.  If they are not happy not earning excessive profits, that \nmakes me worry about how they deal with their patients.   \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nWould this commission determine arbitrarily what they decide is a fair reimbursement?  The \ncommission determines that, not the providers.  Will the commission take into consideration \nresearch, development, advancing, or being able to grow a practice?  Is it anywhere in the bill \nthat the commission is going to allow for a reasonable profit margin so you can reimburse \nsomeone who is building a bigger practice, getting new equipment, getting modernization—\nthe costs of doing business that every other business has to look at?  Will that be a factor \nconsidered?  I do not see it in the bill. \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nThat sounds like something that would be part of the concept of a reasonable profit.  One of \nthe reasons to have a profit is so that you can invest in expansion for the future.  It is \ncertainly something we could put in to make sure it is clear. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAt this time, I will open the phone lines and take testimony in support of Assembly Bill 347.   \n \nAlex Camberos, Private Citizen, Henderson, Nevada:  \nI would like to speak in support of A.B. 347.  I used to have Medicaid.  It saved my life.  \nI was  able  to  see  doctors  and  specialists  who  could  help  diagnose  my  critical  chronic \nillnesses.  Eventually, I had to find my own insurance.  I did my research.  I found what was \navailable for me, what covered my doctors.  Even then, I still struggled to pay my premiums \nand my co-pays.  I think it is a struggle that a lot of my friends experience.  In Nevada, there \nare not enough folks who want to accept Medicaid because their reimbursement rate is too \nlow.  They cannot always see a doctor because they cannot afford to, even with insurance.  \nI think what the bill brought forth by Assemblyman Orentlicher proposes is a good step in the \nright direction to further provide affordable health care for Nevadans.  I urge this Committee \nto support this bill. \n \nRobert Gullickson, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada:  \nI  am  here  to  voice  support  for  Assembly  Bill  347  to  help  ensure  that  health  care \nreimbursements are fair for both patients and providers.  I want to clarify that today I am \nspeaking on behalf of myself and not on behalf of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas \nSchool of Medicine or the United States Air Force.   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 29 \n \nAs a second-year medical student, I have had the privilege of volunteering in clinics aimed at \nhelping underserved populations both in southern Nevada and in northern Nevada.  A lot of \ntimes these patients are not seen due to lack of providers who accept Medicaid.  As a result, a \nlot of them slip through the cracks in our health care system.  It is my belief that this bill will \nimprove  access  to  health  care  for  Medicaid  patients  and,  subsequently,  to  reduce  the \nincidence of many preventable diseases that Nevadans are facing.  I believe this bill will help \naddress the physician shortage in Nevada by providing fair compensation to physicians.   \n \nHawah Ahmad, representing Clark County Education Association:  \nWe want to thank you, Assemblyman Orentlicher, for bringing this bill forward.  We are in \nsupport of it because it is a very much-needed conversation that we have to have, given that \nwe are in the midst of a pandemic.  We know that we are about to foresee some more social, \nemotional, and learning issues that we are going to have to address in addition to our health \nissues.  If we do not start this conversation now, we are going to be hurting down the road.  \nWe look forward to seeing this bill progress and to figuring out how we can come together in \na bipartisan fashion to address the health care needs of every Nevadan.   \n \nMarlene Lockard, representing Service Employees International Union, Local 1107: \nWe appreciate the opportunity to work with Assemblyman Orentlicher in his working groups \nto make this the best bill that could possibly be made and appreciate the opportunity to \nprovide input.  As part of this effort, it is imperative to acknowledge the heroic efforts \nundertaken by the health care workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic.  As efforts to \nvaccinate and control the pandemic continue, it has become clear that the workforce is \nexhausted, and solutions are required.  Health care workers have always been on the front \nlines of caring for our communities, but under the microscope of the pandemic, the industry \nand the rest of society are clearly witness to their dedication, bravery, and stress.  We are in \na time of crisis, and health care workers are stepping up across the country and in Nevada to \nsave lives, sacrifice their own health, and work to save the health of our communities.   \n \n[A document from Marlene Lockard was also submitted but not discussed and is an exhibit \nfor the hearing, Exhibit I].   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe can go to our next caller in support.  [There was no one.]  At this time, I will begin \ntestimony in opposition to Assembly Bill 347.  I plan on giving them a bit of additional time \nbecause of the complex nature of this bill.  The stakeholders represent some key industry \nplayers who are part of this conversation.  I will ask them to limit their remarks to the four to \nfive minutes we talked about, then stay on the line to answer questions. \n \nJaron Hildebrand, representing Nevada State Medical Association: \nI would like to thank Assemblyman Orentlicher for meeting with us and going over his \nproposed amendment and bill with us.  We just cannot come to agreement.   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 30 \n \nI would like to start with the provider tax piece.  We are troubled by the fact that provider \ntaxes would not be borne equally across the health care providers.  There are many provider \ntypes  within  the  Medicaid  system  that  deliver  care  to  patients  that  do  not  receive \nreimbursements.  It is fundamentally unfair to select providers, skilled nursing facilities, \nhospitals, and physicians to bear the burden while other Medicaid providers—home health \nagencies, personal care, hospice, behavioral health, et cetera—who participate within the \nMedicaid system are exempt.  Right now, there is only one state in the entire nation that has \nphysician-specific provider taxes, the state of Minnesota.  Those taxes are currently being \nphased out.   \n \nThere are certain requirements that we need to implement for the tax to actually work.  \nAssemblyman Orentlicher alluded to the fact that over 60 percent of my providers in the state \nwould need to participate.  Our provider groups are not homogenous.  We have a myriad of \nspecialties and within those specialties we have subspecialties.  Many of those specialties do \nnot have a fair amount of Medicaid beneficiaries, but we have some that would make sense.  \nFor example, we can take a pediatrician in Clark County as a hypothetical.  Some specialties \nlike pediatrics have a subspecialty within them.  Their practices can see 60-plus percent \nMedicaid beneficiaries.  About 20 percent have the commercial payers.  We need that \n20 percent to absorb those costs because the Medicaid reimbursements are losing 40 cents on \nthe dollar each time a physician sees a patient based on the lack of reimbursement.  There are \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) rules that need to be implemented.  The \nnationally approved provider tax implemented on skilled nursing would make sense because \nit benefits from this model.  They have a set population group they serve.  It makes sense for \na skilled nursing facility to implement a provider tax to get a higher reimbursement rate on \nMedicaid.  The taxes must be approved by CMS on three conditions:  taxes must be broad-\nbased and imposed on all providers, they must be uniformly imposed both on Medicaid and \nnon-Medicaid providers, states must not hold providers harmless for the burden of the taxes \nalthough  there  is  a  safe  harbor  clause,  and  providers  cannot  exceed  6  percent  of  their \nrevenues either putting into the tax or receiving the tax.  The Peterson-Milbank Program for \nSustainable Health Care Costs and the Primary Care Collaborative (PCC) picked Nevada as \none of the five states to study this exact bill—sustainable health care costs.  We would prefer \nto see how we look at it and get hard data from the PCC.   \n \nI would also like to touch on the rate-fixing piece.  We can appreciate the fact that the \nAssemblyman would like to increase the Medicaid reimbursement rates because that is a \nmajor need for Nevada; however, we do not think the provider tax is the right mechanism \ndue to the fact that our physician community with its various specialties could come to a \n60 percent threshold to trigger the provider taxes for the reimbursement rates.  With the \nmedical malpractice piece, I do not know that is the right mechanism for the cap or for \ndiscussion on that piece.   \n \nThe Division of Health Care Financing and Policy produced a document in 2018 stating that \naligning Medicaid rates for fiscal year 2018 would require an additional General Fund \nappropriation of almost $86 million and an additional $88 million for fiscal year 2019.  That \nwas close to $175 million just for those two years.  This is a new biennium; perhaps the costs \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 31 \n \ncould be an even further burden to the state.  The $175 million is specific to fee-for-service \nrates.  We still have 72 percent of all our Medicaid beneficiaries that run through managed \ncare organizations (MCOs), which are based on contractual rates with physicians in our  \nhealth care system.  It is completely separate from fee-for-service.  I have no idea how you \nwould impose a provider tax on a provider running everything through an MCO by contract \nwith the MCO.  Those are my questions.   \n \nI think the rate piece would be a deterrent to physicians coming to Nevada.  I would like to \nexplain how significant our provider shortage is.  To get to the national average, for family \nmedicine we would need an additional 288 providers.  In internal medicine, we would need \n211 physicians.  For pediatricians, we would need an additional 244 physicians.  For general \nsurgery, we would need 123 additional surgeons.  For obstetrics and gynecology, we would \nneed an additional 111.  I appreciate Assemblyman Orentlicher for trying to increase the \nMedicaid rates to a Medicare rate level, but we feel that is unsustainable for our small \nbusinesses and our small practices.  We worry that would be the end of private practice and \nthat doctors would become employed physicians.  Those are our biggest concerns with \nthis bill. \n \nTom Clark, representing Nevada Association of Health Plans: \nWe are the private insurance carriers here in the state.  We make up only 19 percent of the \nhealth insurance marketplace.  Our opposition comes down to the relationship that the health \ninsurance  providers  have  with  providers.    The  impacts  of  the  rate-setting  commission \nand setting up those rates are going to send a ripple effect throughout the entire market.  The \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, the Division of Insurance [within the Department \nof Business and Industry], the public and private insurers—every aspect of health care has \nbeen  trying  to  attract  doctors  to  Nevada.    Our  biggest  concern  is  not  necessarily  the \nreimbursement rate, although Medicaid reimbursements are well below what they need to be.  \nOur concern is geography and demographics.  When we look at attracting these doctors, we \nrecognize as private insurers that there is a difference between a provider in Elko, Genoa, \nCarson City, Reno, or Las Vegas.  Will the rate-setting commission see the difference?  Will \nthe rates be set at a rate that is taking in all those variables?  Assemblyman Orentlicher has \nsaid that the commission may, but nothing in the bill states they will take those geographic \nand demographic concerns into account.  For example, we need more African-American, \nmore Hispanic, more LGBTQ providers in Nevada.  We fear that setting one rate could send \nthat ripple effect throughout the marketplace and not only keep those doctors from wanting to \npractice here, but also make it harder to retain the doctors we have.   \n \nI also want to talk about the context of A.B. 347 and what is happening within the health \ninsurance system in Nevada and other pieces of legislation.  There is an all-payer claims \ndatabase (APCD).  The all-payer claims database was Senate Bill 472 of the 80th Session.  \nIt did not pass, but the Patient Protection Commission picked up the ball.  There were \nhearings in the Legislative Committee on Health Care during the interim that would create \nthe APCD.  While we were opposed to it back in 2019, because of the time that was taken to \nlook at what the database could do and the infrastructure for doing it, we now support the \nlegislation as it is amended and going forward.  It is also important to recognize that is just \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 32 \n \nthe collection of the data.  The data is going to be used down the road to set policies like \nA.B. 347 contemplates.  If Senate Bill 40 passes and the bill Assemblywoman Carlton has \nthat addresses the APCD passes, that creates the infrastructure for us to collect that data, we \ncan have a stronger policy conversation about the health system.  The Patient Protection \nCommission recently took testimony on a rate benchmark study they are going to move \nforward with.  The information from that study could also provide integral information \ntoward this plan.   \n \nAs I sit here contemplating my testimony, the other thing that comes to mind is that many of \nthe  bills  this  Committee  has  heard  and  that  we  are  seeing  at  the  Legislature  address \ntelehealth.  We are in new times.  Will the rate-setting commission take into consideration \nthe issues around telehealth and how a provider is reimbursed based on the mechanism by \nwhich they provide care?  The other thing I will mention is if this piece of legislation passes, \nwe are very concerned about the effective date because there is no way we can stand up this \ntype of system this year.  For example, in the conversations we have had on the all-payer \nclaims database, the infrastructure just to collect the data could take up to two years to set in \nmotion.  I will remain online for any questions. \n \nI want to thank Assemblyman Orentlicher for having the stakeholder meetings and the \nnumerous one-on-one meetings.  We had this conversation with him; we addressed our \nconcerns one on one.   \n \nJames Wadhams, representing Nevada Hospital Association:  \nEven  though  we  are  appearing  in  opposition,  I  want  to  start  out  on  a  positive  note.  \nAssemblyman Orentlicher has put in time and thought and has identified a major problem in \nthis state; our constituents' access to Medicaid providers.  The Medicaid reimbursement for \nhospitals averages about 57 percent of cost, which is substantially lower than even Medicare.  \nThe attractive opportunity to eliminate that deficit certainly would levelize a lot of costs that \nhave to be shared otherwise.  The problem, I think, is that raising money for Medicaid is truly \na  problem,  and  without  that  you  cannot  achieve  even  what  has  been  perceived  and \nrepresented  as  having  been  done  in  the  state  of  Maryland.    Maryland  has  Medicare, \nMedicaid, and all the providers under a common system.  The way I read this bill, it would \nnot include Medicaid or Medicare, so it would probably end up institutionalizing the problem \nof cost-shifting that Assemblyman Orentlicher clearly identified.   \n \nAs to the rate-setting commission, it seems to be roughly patterned after a public utilities \ncommission regulatory system.  It is easy to think about it in terms of what we see with \nNevada Power, Sierra Pacific Power, NV Energy, or with other utilities that are regulated and \nare truly monopolies.  They are monopolies because they are given a service territory and \na franchise of service.  The question is, is this really a competitive market?  We do not have \na single seller; we do not have an NV Energy in health care.  Is there a restricted entry?  \nCertainly not; in fact, the problem is the reverse.  There is no restriction on entry, and we \ncannot develop the workforce that Jaron Hildebrand from the State Medical Association \nidentified that we are so short of.  On the hospital side, Elite Medical Center was developed \nin southern Nevada in the last few years.  There is no bar to entry at all.  Is there a lack of \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 33 \n \ninnovation in the marketplace?  It would be an indicator of a monopoly.  That clearly is not \nthe case.  We have NICUs [neonatal intensive care units], burn units, trauma centers, and \nstroke centers—a wide array of services—and the technology is here.   \n \nThe  comment  that  was  made  by  an  earlier  speaker  is  worth  mentioning.    These  past \n13 months have been an extraordinary challenge for the health care system.  It is fair to say \nthe health care system has been stretched like a rubber band.  The institutional capacity was \nidentified early on by Governor Steve Sisolak as something we had to protect and make sure \nit did not get overrun.  The personnel who staffed those hospitals from the physicians to the \nnurses to, frankly, everybody who keeps those hospitals operating have been a credit to their \neffort and to the ingenuity and innovation of those hospitals to allow that expansion and \ncontraction to occur in a way that just last fall had a tremendous peak that was at least \nthree times what we thought was our peak.  I only mention \"peaks\" because the statistics \nshow that our cases seem to be on the rise again.  I would not want to predict a surge; I hope \nthat does not occur, but that is an important issue for our current, very fragile health care \nsystem that was stretched financially in the last year.  As Tom Clark mentioned, this is \na competitive market.  We have insurance companies competing for their customers.  We do \nnot  have  a  concentration  of  one  or  two  providers;  we  have  major  providers  in  direct \ncompetition.  The University Medical Center, as a public hospital, is a major anchor hospital.  \nWe have the HCA facilities, the Valley Health System, Dignity Health, Renown Health, \nPrime Healthcare, and lots of nonmajor players that can be used competitively.  It is a highly \ncompetitive market. \n \nWhile the problems that have been identified are representative and clearly problems we \nhave because they impair access to health care, a rate-setting commission does not really \naddress those problems.  That is why we are in opposition to this bill.  There may be other \nways to approach this.  I concur with Tom Clark when he referenced both the study being \ndone by the Patient Protection Commission and the all-payer claims database that will begin \nto give the data that is going to be necessary to evaluate how you make these changes.  \nProfessor White caught my ear.  The point Assemblyman Orentlicher and Professor White \nmade so cogently is that we cannot compare Nevada to other countries; we have to compare \nour country to other countries, which suggests that the approach may need to be dealt with on \nthe national level.  We have had a change in the administration.  President Joe Biden is \ngetting his feet on the ground.  The opportunity for the changes we saw in health care in the \nConsolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 that was passed generated trillions of dollars, and \nother actions that are taking place at the national level could very well provide some of the \nrelief that will alleviate the problems we face with a highly stressed workforce and a capacity \ncrunch.  I think the problems we are dealing with are more on the national level than the \nlocal level.   \n \nContracting is always difficult.  I respect that comment.  We hear complaints about how \ndifficult  these  negotiations  are,  so  that  does  not  suggest  that  these  are  being  done  by \none-sided  transactions  with  one  person  winning  and  the  other  person  losing.    These \nnegotiations would not be tough if they were not being aggressively negotiated by both  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 34 \n \nparties.  And there are multiple parties to negotiate with.  I think this rate-setting commission \nis an interesting idea and raises a lot of points to be discussed, but it probably is not the \nsolution at this point in time in the marketplace.   \n \nI would be happy to stay on the line for any questions.  That concludes my comments at this \nmoment. \n \nGeorge Ross, representing HCA Healthcare: \nFirst, I would like to compliment Assemblyman Orentlicher.  He has put a tremendous \namount of thought into this.  We thank him for the time he spent going over this bill with the \nhospital industry.  I would like to make a super compliment for the way he made the case for \nMedicaid rates.  The most important improvement you could make to health care in Nevada \nis to raise Medicaid rates to match those of Medicare.  I have never seen a more persuasive \ncase for it.  I just hope it was more persuasive than what we have seen over the last \ntwo decades.  We are very grateful for last year's increase.   \n \nI would like to echo James Wadhams that Nevada is not Maryland, it is not Massachusetts.  \nIt does not have great teaching hospitals; it does not have a panoply of wonderful, high-level \ndoctors; it does not have massive access and quality.  Instead, we are forty-fifth or fiftieth in \nevery criteria.  We are a growing state.  What we have to be concerned with as we continue \nto grow is building more rooms, adding more beds, bringing in more doctors, and providing \nmore investment.  Until we meet those needs, that has to be the number one consideration.  \nWe should not be looking at bills that are going to retard and make that less likely.  What we \nneed to be doing is encouraging, not discouraging, investment.  What is important here is the \nquestion of what costs are considered.  Medicare only covers 89 percent of the costs.  We can \nargue, and I heard Joseph White and Assemblyman Orentlicher imply those are reasonable \ncosts.  There are quite a few costs that are not there, a lot of costs hospitals incur are not \nrecognized by that commission, and the return is based upon some but not all of the costs.  \nThe actual return the hospital sees will be significantly less than a fair and reasonable return.  \nHospitals and investors make their decisions based upon their own costs, the way they read \nthe costs, and the return they see, not on the costs that a commission may see.  That is \ncritical.   \n \nWe heard the sponsor and his expert talk about how great this would be for consumers and \ncustomers of insurance companies, but there is not one thing in this bill that requires an \ninsurance company to pass on any of those savings to the employers or the patients.  There is \nnothing  in  there  to  require  them  to  reduce  deductibles,  to  reduce  co-pays,  to  reduce \nco-insurance.  There is nothing in there even to make them pay the rates the commission \nwould set.  We cannot charge anything but that, we cannot ask for anything but that; they do \nnot have to pay it.  I remind you all that a large portion of the payers in this state are \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) plans over which we have no \ncontrol.  Those are critical points.   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 35 \n \nI would also like to point out that we were told this would eliminate surprise billing.  We \nalready did that last year, so it is already done.  Additionally, we are concerned about the \ncomposition of the commission.  That must be a very fair commission; it has to be a very \nbalanced commission.  In this bill, we have to have a way to appeal not just a commission \ndecision because that is not in there either, or the timing of their decisions, or the timing of \nwhen they have to answer an appeal.  Time is money.  The longer we have to wait, the more \none is dissuaded from making investments.  We also have to have a way to appeal to the \nmembers of that commission if, in fact, we believe they are strongly biased in one way or \nanother.  I had a personal experience in the early part of my career in managing a group \nwhich kept an oil company's refining and marketing from breaking the rules.  We had \na massive number of rules on price controls.  You end up spending most of your time and \nmanpower figuring out how to be on board with the controls, how to make money out of the \ncontrols, and less time on figuring out good investments.   \n \nIn terms of cost savings, we were told we would be able to get rid of tons of administrative \nclerks.  I remember going through all these cost cuttings.  If you have a hundred bills and \nevery one is different and you have a hundred bills to different entities that are exactly the \nsame amount, you still have a hundred bills and you have a hundred entities to whom you \npay and you have to keep track of them all.  So you are not really going to save all that many \npeople.  I would have to emphasize again, we have to look at our own costs.   \n \nI will remind you of the role Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center plays in the community.  \nWe are the largest Medicaid provider in the state.  Forty-two percent of our patients are \nMedicaid recipients.  Another 6 to 8 percent are uninsured, which basically means they do \nnot pay.  We have a large Medicare customer base.  Only 16 percent of our patients use \ncommercial insurance.  We must get the money from those commercial client customers to \npay that gap.  I know that Assemblyman Orentlicher thinks this rate will solve that problem.   \n \nHe also says he wants to reward efficiency.  We think we are extremely efficient.  He wants \nto reward the severity of caseload.  We have a comparatively high severity.  If we get \na higher rate to balance our poor mix, our efficiency, and our severity, we will be above the \nmarket and nobody will want to come.  It is our experience that insurance companies value \nwhat they have to pay at a higher level than other factors.  All of sudden we will be stuck, \nand we cannot bargain.  Today, you could sit down and  make a bargain with various \ncompanies, payers, and plans, and balance all the contents of that in such way that they are \nhappy enough to come to the hospital as a customer and we are able to get enough money to \npay and fill that hole.  Under this system, I have no confidence that would be possible. \n \nMadam Chair, thank you very much for holding this hearing.  It has been a balanced and fair \nhearing.  Everybody is getting a fair chance to say his or her piece on what could be one of \nthe most important bills that I have worked on in my 30 years of lobbying in Nevada. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 36 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you.  I wanted to give you the opportunity to correct yourself.  I assume you did not \nmean to say that our teaching hospitals at University of Nevada, Las Vegas and University of \nNevada, Reno were not excellent and not growing and not moving up in standings, but we \njust do not have the number of teaching hospitals that a state such as Massachusetts has.   \n \nGeorge Ross: \nThey are doing very well.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI will go to the phone lines for testimony in opposition.  Testimony will be limited to \ntwo minutes.   \n \nSusan Fisher, representing Nevada State Society of Anesthesiologists; and the Nevada \nOrthopaedic Society:   \nWe  are  testifying  in  opposition  to  A.B.  347.    We  appreciate  the  time  Assemblyman \nOrentlicher spent with us, but we just cannot get there.  No state has shown this provider tax \nto work, not one.  Where it has been implemented, it has either been repealed or there have \nbeen no opt-ins.  After several Medicaid cuts over the last 12 years, including a massive \n43 percent  cut  for  anesthesiologists  during  the  Great  Recession,  this  tax  provides  little \nassurance that more cuts will not happen.  The economy goes south, medical providers get \ncut, and rates do not come back up accordingly when the economy rebounds.  At a time when \nwe are facing provider shortages and after the past year with provider burnout, this is not the \ntime to introduce into Nevada's already overstressed health care environment an experiment \nthat has failed elsewhere.  We urge you not to process A.B. 347.   \n \nDan Musgrove, representing Valley Health System of Hospitals: \nI will not be redundant.  I appreciate the last comment you made before turning it over to \nmore testimony in opposition.  Nevada, this Legislature, and hospitals have worked very hard \non expanding our graduate medical education program.  The Valley Health System, including \nour Valley Hospital, runs about 75 medical students through our hospital every year, and we \nare looking to expand that program.  You heard from Jaron Hildebrand that Nevada could \nbecome a place that physicians see as unfriendly.  We work on the effort to train those \ndoctors, and they end up leaving and heading elsewhere to pastures that are much greener.  \nWe certainly do not want to get back to McCarran International Airport being our health care \nfacility of choice.  I want to thank you, Chair, for allowing us to testify, and the sponsor for \nall the time he spent with all of us to try to listen to our concerns. \n \nConnor Cain, representing Henderson Chamber of Commerce:  \nI would like to acknowledge and thank Assemblyman Orentlicher and Natalie Johns for all \ntheir work on this issue over the past few months.  This included a meeting with the \nHenderson Chamber.  Unfortunately, the feedback the Henderson Chamber has received on \nA.B. 347 is that it exacerbates existing problems in our health care system.  One issue to  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 37 \n \nhighlight is that the theoretical foundation of A.B. 347 is built on Medicaid rates being raised \nto Medicare rates, but the bill does not ensure this will occur.  I will conclude by again \nthanking Assemblyman Orentlicher for his tireless work, but we are opposed to A.B. 347.  \n \nBrian Kleven, Chief Financial Officer, Dignity Health-St. Rose Dominican:   \nDignity  Health-St.  Rose  Dominican  represents  the  only  not-for-profit  health  system  in \nsouthern Nevada.  I am calling in opposition to A.B. 347.  I will say, \"Ditto,\" to most of what \nmy colleagues said, but will add a few points.  Medicare rates do not cover our costs, and \nthere is no guarantee in this bill that either the State or the commission would pay providers \nhigher than Medicare rates, which concerns us significantly.  Also, the bill does not provide \na way to appeal commission decisions or address conflicts of interest on the rate commission, \nwhich is massively concerning.  In addition to previous testimony, there are many unknowns \nrelated to this bill.  It is extremely difficult for my team to determine the kind of impact it \nwould have on the St. Rose system.  One issue I can speak to.  If commercial insurance rates \nwere set at Medicare levels, that issue alone would equate to a $183 million bottom-line \nreduction to our market that serves the greater Las Vegas area.  This could very possibly lead \nto  elimination  of  needed  service  lines  we  provide  to  the  community  and  possible  job \nelimination  for  the  very  employees  who  saved  lives  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  \nIn 2020 alone, which was an extremely difficult year with the pandemic, St. Rose contributed \nover $154 million in community benefits.  Because St. Rose is a not-for-profit system, any \nearnings we have are reinvested back into the community to bolster Nevada's limited public \nhealth structure and pay for charity care.  St. Rose has been doing the right thing in this \ncommunity since 1947, and this bill would jeopardize our ability to adequately treat patients \nin our community.  The rate-setting commission is wrong for Nevada.  Thank you for your \ntime and for serving as elected officials during these trying times.  \n \nJoseph Heck, representing Nevada Osteopathic Medical Association:  \nWe are in opposition to the bill for all the reasons previously stated by the other opponents.  \nThe only thing I would like to add is the use of noneconomic medical malpractice damages \nas a potential benefit would have no additional benefit, as medical malpractice noneconomic \ndamages are already capped at $350,000 in Nevada law as instituted by voter initiative \nin 2004.  We appreciate Assemblyman Orentlicher's long-range vision to try to increase \naccess and lower costs, but we feel this bill is not the right way to go about it. \n \nJesse Wadhams, representing Vegas Chamber:   \nWe agree with the opposition, and we thank Assemblyman Orentlicher for his vision. \n \nJessica  Ferrato,  representing  American  College  of  Emergency  Physicians,  Nevada \nChapter:   \nI would like to thank Assemblyman Orentlicher for his consistent outreach and collaboration \nwith stakeholders, and I would like to echo the comments of my colleagues.  I would like to \nhighlight a few items that are specific to emergency departments and physicians in the state.  \nEmergency departments are the safety net of the health care system.  We see patients no \nmatter the severity or the ability to pay.  Medicaid rates are a constant concern, especially as  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 38 \n \nthe state continues to face fiscal challenges and recovers from the pandemic.  Emergency \nroom (ER) physicians are the most impacted by the low Medicaid rates throughout the state \nbecause we take all those patients.  Even though ER physicians are positioned to benefit the \nmost from a provider tax because we see more Medicaid patients than any others, we still \nhave some concerns on how it will work in this bill.  We are worried about unanticipated \nimpacts to providers and patients; we have concerns that there are not any \"hold harmless\" \nprovisions available for providers to ensure that money that is put into the fund comes back \nto the providers in the form of increased rates.   \n \nIn terms of the rate-setting commission, we have concerns.  Setting rates at Medicare levels \nduring the pandemic or otherwise is problematic.  There are not any emergency doctors who \ncan operate solely off Medicare rates; they do not cover costs.  In addition, the wording in the \nbill around how this commission would raise rates appears subjective.  Medicare rates are \na significant barrier for recruiting in Nevada, which impacts patient care.  This comes in the \nform of provider shortages, long wait times to see a provider, and even wait times and \navailability for procedures.  We are concerned about the impact to the future health care \nsystem, and we look forward to continuing to work with Assemblyman Orentlicher on this \npolicy moving forward.   \n \nGabriele McGregor, representing Nevada Resort Association:  \nThe Nevada Resort Association is in opposition to A.B. 347.  In the interest of time, I will \njust say, \"Me too.\" \n \nMisty Grimmer, representing North Vista Hospital:  \nWe are before you in opposition to A.B. 347.  We appreciate the open door and multiple \nmeetings Assemblyman Orentlicher has had on this bill to get input from the industry and \nappreciate the shared goal of increasing Medicaid reimbursement rates in Nevada.  However, \nwe do not believe the provisions of this bill will achieve that goal, and they will ultimately \nend up increasing the cost of health care for the citizens of Nevada.  The design of the rate-\nsetting commission in this bill puts restrictions on only one portion of the health care market, \nputting the hospital community at a disadvantage.  Others have already addressed the issue of \ncosts, so I will just echo those comments. \n \nNorth Vista is not a large hospital, but we are the only hospital located in North Las Vegas.  \nUnlike  other  hospital  systems  with  multiple  locations  in  Las  Vegas,  we  have  just  the \none campus.  This means we do not have as much ability to make up in volume what is lost \nfrom one service to the next.  The ability to negotiate with our fellow providers and the \npayers is important for a small player.   \n \nThank you for your time.  We respectfully request that the Committee not process this bill. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe will take our last caller in opposition.  I would encourage anyone waiting on the line to \nsubmit their written comments in opposition.   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 39 \n \nChris Bosse, representing Renown Health:   \nI appreciate the Assemblyman's openness to share ideas and hear concerns about this bill.  \nHowever, we are still opposed to A.B. 347.  Rate-setting for health care providers and \nhospitals is not the right solution for Nevada.  At this point, I think most of my points have \nbeen made, so \"Me too.\"  Since this bill does not really provide a mechanism to achieve the \noriginally stated goals of reducing costs at the consumer level, it does not ever get to impact \nthe payers.  The bill only puts access to care in Nevada at risk.  Renown is a private, \nnonprofit,  locally  owned  and  operated,  integrated  delivery  system  located  primarily  in \nWashoe County.  We strive to continue to meet the needs of the communities we serve.  \nRate-setting, in the short term, will impact our ability to expand capacity and services to meet \nthe growing needs.  In the midterm, it will likely impact our ability to care for patients.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWith that, I will close testimony in opposition.  I will open for testimony in neutral.  Neutral \ntestimony  is  not  taking  a  position  on  the  bill,  either  for  or  against;  it  is  truly  neutral \ntestimony.  [There was none.]  I will close testimony in neutral.  I will open for questions \nfrom members of the Committee.  Assemblyman Hafen, do you have further questions? \n \nAssemblyman Hafen:   \nNo, Madam Chair. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any follow-up questions?  [There were none.]  Are there any closing remarks? \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nWould Professor White or other copresenters like to make comments? \n \nJoseph White: \nI would like to say a couple of things.  There is very strong evidence that there are substantial \nextra costs associated with billing in the American health care system and Nevada's.  It is not \nthe case that sending out the same number of bills when the bills are all by the same rules is \njust as expensive as sending out that number of bills with extremely complicated different \nrules about what is involved.  If that were the case, then the amount of billing expense in the \nUnited States and Canada or the United States and many other countries would not be so \ndifferent.  I think there are savings to be had.  The savings related to administrative costs and \nthe complexity of the billing are in the range of 5-10 percent of costs, according to most of \nthe studies that have been done.  There have been studies that show the average American \nphysician practice is spending about $80,000 per doctor on billing.  It is much lower in other \ncountries.  There is a savings; there are inefficiencies there.  Given that we spend so much \nmore money than other countries, we should be looking for a way to get those savings.  The \nmost obvious way to get those savings is with standardized prices and all-payer payment.   \n \nI cannot speak to the question of the shortages of physicians in Nevada.  It is for you to think \nabout what the reasons are for that.  Right now, it is true that costs per capita in Nevada are \nlower than in a lot of other states.  Costs per capita for physician services, however, are not.  \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 40 \n \nThey are about the same as the average in other states.  They are lower because of things like \nhospital payments and some services like home health.  I do not know why that is.  I think \nthere is an important point made here about thinking about the different providers that are \ninvolved—on the Medicaid side, that can be skilled nursing facilities, home health, and so \non—and thinking about the different providers that are involved with other aspects of health \ncare.  I think it is important to remember that a lot of employer-based health care is through \nERISA plans.  If costs are lower for employers, maybe they will not pass the savings along, \nbut it is not a matter of their negotiations with insurers because they are simply experiencing \nthe cost directly, and the insurers are simply processing for them.  I think you need to think \nabout how the ERISA plans work out in this process.   \n \nThere is a lot to think about.  There are legitimate questions to ask about supply and what is \ngoing on with Nevada costs overall.  Nevada has a low number of doctors per capita.  It also \nhas a relatively younger population than most states but not in line with the number of \ndoctors.  I think there are significant questions about what attracts doctors.  It is possible that \nhaving a system which is much less of a hassle for doctors, in terms of billing and dealing \nwith the cost structure in their practices, could logically mean it would be easier for doctors \nto be in smaller or solo practice instead of selling out to larger practices in part to handle all \nthat.  There are savings out there.  It would seem like a good idea to capture them in \nsome way. \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nThank you, members of the Committee, and all the stakeholders who worked with me over \nthe past few months.  I would like to say a few things in response to some of the comments \nfrom those in opposition.  There were some things said that are not accurate representations \nof the bill.  Jaron Hildebrand was concerned about whether the provider tax would be \nequitable.  His concern was that not all doctors see Medicaid patients, but all would pay the \ntax.  It is true that the only way you receive money back, a 3-to-1 return—that is guaranteed, \nit is not speculative—for every dollar the providers put in, three dollars come back, but only \nif you take care of Medicaid patients.  To me, that is a good thing in terms of equity because \nit says that the more you see Medicaid patients, the more you are willing to provide care to \nthe neediest among us, the more you will get paid.  I think that is good.  It provides an \nincentive to see Medicaid patients.  For those doctors who are in a specialty or a location \nwhere  there  is  not  an  opportunity  to  see  Medicaid  patients,  one  way  to  meet  their \nresponsibility to share in the care of Medicaid patients is to pay toward their care if they \ncannot provide the care themselves.  I think in terms of equity, this is designed very well. \n \nJames Wadhams suggested the health care market is a competitive market.  That is at odds \nwith the understanding of every health economist I am aware of.  The reason we need the \nrate-setting commission is the health care market does not operate like a competitive market.  \nWe have excessive and highly varying prices.  Nobody in the health economics world thinks \nthis is working properly.  That is why we need government intervention to correct the market \nfailure.  For providers and patients, we are saying we want to ensure all providers are \ncompensated fairly.  We cover their costs and a reasonable profit.  That means there will be \nproviders available for patients.  We are saying to providers that we will eliminate all this \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 2, 2021 \nPage 41 \n \nadministrative complexity that Professor White talked about.  They do not need to have \nnegotiations or spend hours a day filling out different forms for different providers and doing \nall these different negotiations.  And we will provide stronger protection against the threat of \nprofessional liability.  I have heard over the years from health care providers that those things \nare important.  They want to be paid fairly; they do not like to deal with administrative \npaperwork and bureaucratic hassle; and they want to be protected against unfair malpractice \nlitigation.  All those things are in the bill.  The only thing they do not get is the ability to \ncharge excessive profits.  We do not want them to gouge patients.  That is the only thing they \ndo not get out of this bill.   \n \nThank you very much for your consideration.  I look forward to working with everybody to \nmove this forward. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you, Assemblyman Orentlicher and Committee.  I understand all callers wishing to \ntestify  in  opposition  were  heard.   This  was  an  extra-long  hearing,  but  I  think  it  is  an \nimportant policy topic.  We need to have these kinds of conversations.  I appreciate your \npatience with me in having this policy conversation in a virtual setting.   \n \n[Exhibit J was submitted but not discussed and is included as an exhibit for this hearing.] \n \nI will close the hearing on Assembly Bill 347.  Is there any public comment?  [There was \nnone.]  I will close public comment.  We have a meeting on Monday [April 5, 2021].  I do \nnot anticipate needing to have any night or additional meetings.

I will start off with \nthe work session.  Let us begin with Assembly Bill 205.  Mr. Ashton, can you please present \nthe bill with the amendments? \n \nAssembly Bill  205:   Makes  various  changes  concerning  the  acquisition,  possession, \nprovision  or  administration  of  auto-injectable  epinephrine  and  opioid \nantagonists by schools. (BDR 40-98) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \nAs a reminder, as nonpartisan staff I cannot advocate nor oppose any measures that you will \nconsider today.  \n \n[Patrick  Ashton  presented  the  work  session  document,  Exhibit  C.]    Assembly  Bill  205  \nwas heard on March 31, 2021.  This bill authorizes certain health care professionals to issue \nan  order  for  opioid  antagonists  to  a  public  or  private  school  for  the  treatment  of  an  \nopioid-related drug overdose that may be experienced by a person at the school.  This bill \nalso authorizes a school nurse or other designated employee of a school who is properly \ntrained to administer an opioid antagonist to any person on the premises of the school who is \nreasonably  believed  to  be  experiencing  an  opioid-related  drug  overdose.    Additionally, \nA.B. 205: \n \n•  Establishes  certain  storage,  handling,  and  transportation  requirements  related  to \nopioid antagonists; \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \n•  Requires a school that obtains an order for an opioid antagonist to provide certain \ntraining relating to the storage and administration of opioid antagonists to designated \nemployees of the school; \n \n•  Requires each school district and charter school to report to the Division of Public \nand Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services certain \ninformation relating to the administration of opioid antagonists at public schools in \nthis state; \n \n•  Requires the board of trustees of each school district and the governing body of each \ncharter or private school that obtains an order for an opioid antagonist to establish \ncertain policies to ensure that emergency assistance is sought each time a person \nexperiences a drug overdose at a school, and the parent or guardian of a pupil to \nwhom an opioid antagonist is administered is notified of the administration as soon as \npracticable. \n  \nFinally, this bill provides that a health care professional is not subject to disciplinary action \nfor issuing an order for opioid antagonists to a school, and exempts a school, school district, \nemployee  of  a  school,  registered  pharmacist,  health  care  professional  and  certain  other \npersons from liability for certain damages relating to the acquisition, possession, provision or \nadministration  of  auto-injectable  epinephrine  or  an  opioid  antagonist  under  certain \ncircumstances. \n \nAssemblywoman Cohen proposes to amend the bill to limit the exemptions prescribed in \nsections 5 and 8 of the bill to only exempt from liability a school, school district, employee \nof a school, and certain other persons affiliated with a school for any error or omission \nconcerning the acquisition, possession, provision, or administration of epinephrine or an \nopioid antagonist if:  (1) the administration occurs during an emergency; and (2) the error or \nomission is not a result of gross negligence or reckless, willful, or wanton conduct. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any questions?  [There were none.]  Do I have a motion to amend and do pass \nA.B. 205? \n \nASSEMBLYMAN  HAFEN  MADE  A  MOTION  TO  AMEND  AND  DO \nPASS ASSEMBLY BILL 205. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN TITUS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION PASSED.  (ASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS WAS ABSENT \nFOR THE VOTE.) \n \nI will assign the floor statement to Assemblyman Matthews. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nNext, we will go to Assembly Bill 343.  There were some substantial amendments, and \nPatrick Ashton will go over them as well as the bill. \n \nAssembly Bill 343:  Provides for walking audits of urbanized areas. (BDR 40-742) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \n[Patrick Ashton presented the work session document, Exhibit D.]  Assembly Bill 343 was \nheard on March 29, 2021.  The bill requires a district health department and the Division of \nPublic and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct a \ntriennial walking audit of each census tract in certain urbanized areas to determine the degree \nto which the physical environment of the area audited contributes to or detracts from public \nhealth.  The bill also requires the health department or Division, as applicable, to:  (1) submit \nthe  results  of  the  audit  to  the  governing  body  of  the  city  or  county  and  the  planning \ncommission having jurisdiction over the census tract; and (2) post the results of the audit on \nthe Internet.   \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas proposes the following amendments to the bill, and you may also \nsee the attached conceptual amendment: \n \nDelete subsection 1 of section 1 and instead: \n \n1)  Require certain local government entities within the urbanized areas of each Clark and \nWashoe County to collaborate during the 2021-2022 Legislative Interim and develop a \nproposed plan for each county for conducting walking audits within urbanized areas of \nthe respective county.  The proposed plans shall consider the following items: \n \na)  Identification of agency responsibilities for the audits; \nb)  Use of geographic information systems (GIS) technology to collect and display data; \nc)  Identification of the priorities to be used in identifying areas to be audited; \nd)  Identification of the area size to be audited, such as by census tract or other; \ne)  Inclusion of additional parameters or information in the audits; \nf)  Involvement of other entities (profit, nonprofit, or governmental); \ng)  Ways to engage the community in the audits; \nh)  A regular schedule for walking audits; \ni)  The number of audits to be conducted annually; and \nj)  Formats for displaying and publicizing the audit results. \n  \n2)  Require  the  Nevada  Department  of  Transportation  (NDOT)  to  participate  in  the \ndevelopment of these proposed plans, to the extent feasible and appropriate based on \nNDOT's jurisdiction. \n \n3)  Require the Southern Nevada Health District for Clark County and the Washoe County \nHealth  District  for  Washoe  County  to  assist  in  the  development  of  the  respective \nproposals and to publish the results of any walking audit conducted on their respective \nInternet websites. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \n4)  Require both Clark and Washoe Counties to report their respective plans outlining their \nproposals for implementation of walking audits to the Legislative Committee on Health \nCare no later than June 1, 2022. \n \nOther amendments: \n \n5)  Revise subsection 2 of section 1 to retain the parameters related to walking audits as \noptional parameters in the respective proposed plans, to the extent possible. \n \n6)  Delete section 2, thereby removing the unfunded mandate provision in the bill. \n \n7)  Make this bill effective upon passage and approval. \n \nFinally, I want to state on the record that the stakeholders of this bill will work with the Legal \nDivision  of  the  Legislative  Counsel  Bureau  to  clarify  the  requirements  regarding  the \nreporting and publication of any walking audits as outlined in the conceptual amendment. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you for that clarification, Mr. Ashton.  Assemblywoman Thomas is here to answer \nany questions.  I know she reached out to many of the stakeholders who had concerns during \nthe hearing, and I believe her conceptual amendment takes those into consideration.  Are \nthere any members of the Committee who have questions based on that amendment? \n \nAssemblyman Hafen: \nI wanted to thank Assemblywoman Thomas for working with the stakeholders.  I will be \nvoting no today on this bill but would like to reserve my right to change my vote after I see \nthe actual amended language.  I know a lot of work has gone into this, and after seeing the \nlanguage, I may want to change my vote. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nSeeing no further questions regarding this bill, do I have a motion to amend and do pass \nA.B. 343? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  BENITEZ-THOMPSON  MADE  A  MOTION  TO \nAMEND AND DO PASS ASSEMBLY BILL 343. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN GORELOW SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nAre there any questions or comments regarding the bill?  [There were none.] \n \nTHE  MOTION  PASSED.    (ASSEMBLYMEN  BLACK,  HAFEN, \nMATTHEWS, AND TITUS VOTED NO.  ASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS \nWAS ABSENT FOR THE VOTE.) \n \nI will assign the floor statement to Assemblywoman Thomas. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nWe will now go to our next bill on work session which is Assembly Bill 344. \n \nAssembly Bill 344:  Authorizes the establishment of a program to facilitate transition of \nthe care of older persons and vulnerable persons. (BDR 38-743) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \n[Patrick Ashton presented the work session document, Exhibit E.]  On March 29, 2021, we \nheard Assembly Bill 344.  The bill authorizes the Aging and Disability Services Division of \nthe  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  to  establish  a  program  to  facilitate  the \ntransition of older persons and vulnerable persons from a hospital to their places of residence.  \nAssembly  Bill  344  requires  such  a  program  to:    (1)  provide  for  collaboration  between \nhospital staff responsible for a discharge, the older or vulnerable person being discharged, \nand his or her caregivers; and (2) facilitate the coordination of health care and social services \nfor  an  older  or  vulnerable  person.    Assemblywoman  Thomas  proposes  the  following \namendments,  and  there  is  also  a  conceptual  amendment  attached  to  the  work  session \ndocument.  The amendments are as follows: \n \n1.  Change  \"vulnerable  person\"  to  \"person  with  a  disability\"  throughout  the  bill, \nthereby authorizing the Division to establish a program to facilitate the transition of \nolder persons and persons with disabilities, rather than older persons and vulnerable \npersons; \n \n2.  For purposes of the provisions of this bill, define \"person with a disability\" to have \nthe meaning ascribed to it in section 1 of Assembly Bill 35, which defines the term \nto  include  a  person  with  a  physical  disability,  a  person  with  certain  related \nconditions, and a person with an intellectual disability; \n \n3.  Clarify in subsection 2, paragraph (c) of section 1 that the Division may fund the \nprogram by billing third parties for the services provided by the program for current \nplan members only; and \n \n4.  Assemblywoman  Thomas  wants  to  correct  this  amendment  and  have \nAssemblywoman Lisa Krasner instead of Assemblywoman Heidi Kasama added as \na cosponsor to the bill. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any questions about the bill at this time? \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI appreciate the amendment and the work from the bill's sponsor.  From my reading, I do not \nthink there is anything in the bill that would absolve the hospital from its normal due \ndiligence for providing for a safe discharge.  I want to be sure we are not shifting burden.  An \nancillary program by the county would be wonderful, we absolutely need it, but even if that \nbecomes effective, I do not see anything touching the hospitals' obligation for safe discharge. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nThat is a true statement. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you.  Do we have any other questions regarding this?  [There were none.]  At this \ntime, I will seek a motion to amend and do pass A.B. 344. \n \nASSMEMBLYWOMAN BENITEZ-THOMPSON MADE A MOTION TO \nAMEND AND DO PASS ASSEMBLY BILL 344. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  SUMMERS-ARMSTRONG  SECONDED  THE \nMOTION. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI will take any comments on the motion at this time. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nUnfortunately, although the concept is well-meaning, I cannot support this bill as written \neven with the amendments.  It goes along with the question Assemblywoman Benitez-\nThompson asked.  Right now, we have to have a safe discharge.  This bill may actually create \nsome problems when enacted and delay some of those discharges because we are not able to \ndo some of the things the bill is asking us to do.  I think the hospitals are already obligated to \ndo this; they already have programs and certain places that can handle such a program.  \nThere is nothing that limits them from starting, so I will be voting no. \n \nTHE  MOTION  PASSED.    (ASSEMBLYMEN  BLACK,  HAFEN, \nMATTHEWS, AND TITUS VOTED NO.  ASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS \nWAS ABSENT FOR THE VOTE.) \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAt this time, we are moving to our next bill on work session, Assembly Bill 426. \n \nAssembly  Bill  426:    Makes  various  changes  relating  to  the  protection  of  children. \n(BDR 38-516) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \n[Patrick Ashton presented the work session document, Exhibit F.]  Assembly Bill 426, which \nwe heard on March 31, 2021, authorizes an agency that provides child welfare services or its \ndesignee to request that the court issue a warrant to place a child in protective custody if \nthere is reasonable cause to believe that the child needs protection from injury, abuse, or \nneglect but the threat is not imminent in the time it would take to obtain a warrant.  The bill \nalso sets forth certain requirements for such a warrant. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nAssembly Bill 426 also: \n \n•  Clarifies that a court may, upon the initiative of the court or a special master, find \nthat a person has a special interest in a child, and, therefore, must be involved in and \nnotified of certain plans and proceedings relating to the placement of the child; \n \n•  Clarifies that a finding that a person has a special interest in a child may be reviewed \nor modified at any time by the court or special master; \n \n•  Revises provisions relating to the notice given to a parent or other person responsible \nfor the child's welfare before certain hearings related to the placement of a child in \nprotective custody; \n \n•  Clarifies that certain determinations by a court relating to the placement of a child \nmust be made based on a preponderance of the evidence; \n \n•  Allows the attorney general to sign a petition alleging that a child is in need of \nprotections; and \n \n•  Authorizes the court to dispose of a case if the court finds by a preponderance of the \nevidence  that  the  child  needed  protection  at  the  time  of  the  completion  of  the \ninvestigation by the agency which provides child welfare services, if the child was \nnot removed from the home. \n \nThere were no amendments. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any questions?  I will note that there was a pretty substantial explanation document \non the Nevada Electronic Legislative Information System provided as part of the work \nsession document that this working group of 45 attorneys, judges, court administrators, \npublic defenders, and district attorneys all agreed on [pages 2-4, Exhibit F]. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI appreciate the walk-through and more intent explanation on these bills.  It was a large \nworking group.  I wanted to make sure the thought and intent was captured and living \nsomewhere in a public space.  When we refer back to the legislative record, groups of people \ncan change, they do not remain static; so there is something for future legislators, future \nparents caught in the system, and future people who are part of the system, to refer back to.  \nI know some of this was coming from case law as well, and so we are codifying pieces of \nthat.  I appreciate the fact that is in the work session. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI agree.  I appreciate the work that went into putting that into a working document that will \nbecome a part of the legislative history.  Are there any other questions regarding this bill?  \n[There were none.]  May I have a motion to do pass A.B. 246? \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  GORELOW  MADE  A  MOTION  TO  DO  PASS \nASSEMBLY BILL 426. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN TITUS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nAre there any comments on the motion at this time?  [There were none.] \n \nTHE MOTION PASSED.  (ASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS WAS ABSENT \nFOR THE VOTE.) \n \nI will assign the floor statement to Assemblywoman Krasner. \n \nNext, we will go to Assembly Bill 430.  \n \nAssembly Bill 430:  Revises provisions relating to disabilities. (BDR 39-1048) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \n[Patrick Ashton presented the work session document, Exhibit G.]  Assembly Bill 430 was \nheard on April 2, 2021, and it revises or removes certain obsolete terms used to describe the \nprovision  of  certain  services  to  persons  with  intellectual  disabilities  and  persons  with \ndevelopmental  disabilities  in  Chapter  435  of  Nevada  Revised  Statutes.    There  were  no \namendments. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any questions regarding Assembly Bill 430?  [There were none.]  May I have a \nmotion to do pass A.B. 430? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  TITUS  MADE  A  MOTION  TO  DO  PASS \nASSEMBLY BILL 430. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  SUMMERS-ARMSTRONG  SECONDED  THE \nMOTION. \n \nAre there any comments on the bill?  [There were none.] \n \nTHE MOTION PASSED.  (ASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS WAS ABSENT \nFOR THE VOTE.) \n \nI will assign that floor statement to Assemblywoman Brown-May, with Assemblywoman \nBlack as backup.   \n \nThat concludes our work session for today, and we will move into our bill hearing.  We are \ngoing to start by opening the hearing on Assembly Bill 348.  Assemblywoman Carlton, begin \nwhen you are ready. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nAssembly Bill 348:  Revises provisions relating to the Patient Protection Commission. \n(BDR 40-497) \n \nAssemblywoman Maggie Carlton, Assembly District No. 14: \nI want to thank your wonderful staff who helped me with Assembly Bill 348.  This was one \nof those bills where you give all the descriptions and walk people through, you receive the \nbill, and you wonder where the miscommunication might have happened.  Your staff were \nvery helpful getting me through the bill and getting back to the place I wanted to be.   \n \nI would like to draw your attention to the conceptual amendment on the Nevada Electronic \nLegislative Information System [Exhibit H].  As I said, this bill did not quite come out the \nway we planned it.  I will be working from the conceptual amendment. \n \nDuring the 2019 Session, the Legislature passed Senate Bill 544 of the 80th Session which \nhad  been  proposed  by  Governor  Sisolak.    That  bill  created  a  Patient  Protection \nCommission—an independent body tasked with reviewing issues related to Nevadans' health \ncare  needs  as  well  as  health  care  accessibility,  affordability,  and  quality.    However, \nlegislation can be iterative—it is constantly evolving.  After the Commission got up and \nrunning, we recognized the need to make some adjustments to it.  I would like to thank \nDr. Ikram Khan, who did an excellent job leading the Commission, and Executive Director \nSara Cholhagian.  They were just getting up and going and then the pandemic happened.  \nI would like to thank them for all the hard work they did on the Commission and for the \n\"deliverables\" that have come out of the Commission. \n \nThe goals of A.B. 348 are to move the Patient Protection Commission (PPC) from the Office \nof the Governor to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), revise the \nCommission membership, ensure members are held accountable, address issues related to \nconflicts of interest, and give the Commission tools to operate more effectively.  If you turn \nto the bill and proposed amendment, I would like to walk you through them. \n \nThe first issue is the removal of the advisory committee.  It was never my intent to create a \nPatient Protection Commission Advisory Committee, so the first item in the conceptual \namendment [Exhibit H] proposes to delete section 1.  Item 3 in the amendment also restores \nthe  Commission's  existing  duties  which  were  deleted  in  the  bill  as  introduced.    The \namendment does not change section 2 of the bill, which moves the Commission under the \nOffice of the Director of DHHS, revises Commission membership, and increases the number \nof voting members from 11 to 12.  Specifically, section 2 revises the membership as is listed \nin the bill to include: \n \n•  A registered nurse who practices primarily at a nonprofit hospital; \n•  A physician or registered nurse who practices primarily at a Federally Qualified \nHealth Center; \n•  A pharmacist at a pharmacy not affiliated with any chain of pharmacies or a person \nwho has expertise and experience in advocating on behalf of patients; \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \n•  A nonprofit public hospital located in the county that spends the largest amount of \nmoney on hospital care for indigent individuals; \n•  A representative of the private nonprofit health insurer with the highest percentage of \ninsured people who are adversely affected by social determinants of health; \n•  A person who has expertise and experience advocating for the uninsured; \n•  A person who has expertise and experience advocating for people with special health \ncare needs; and \n•  A DHHS employee with expertise in health information technology and patient \naccess to medical records. \n \nThere is one small change I would like to propose in this section.  It was brought to my \nattention that there may not always be an employee available and that it might be best to get a \nconsultant,  depending  upon  how  health  information  technology  (HIT)  actually  works.  \nI would like to add in the option of an employee or consultant, depending upon who would \nbe the best fit for HIT.  The section also adds the executive officer of the Public Employees' \nBenefits Program as an ex officio member. \n \nSection 23 staggers the terms of the new members to ensure that not all term out at the same \ntime.    We  understand  how  important  the  historical  perspective  and  continuity  in  the \nCommission  needs  to  be.    This  is  our  standard  way  when  we  change  membership  of \ncommissions—to be able to allow people through attrition to move out and the new positions \nto move in. \n \nIn dealing with conflicts of interest, section 2 provides that members of the Commission \nmust  comply  with  the  requirements  of  Nevada  Revised  Statutes  281A.420  regarding \ndisclosure of conflicts of interest and abstention on voting because of conflicts. \n \nItem  5  is  the  accountability  issue,  and  the  conceptual  amendment  requires  that  the \nCommission adopt bylaws to provide an operational framework of duties.  In addition, the \namendment provides that members serve at the pleasure of the Governor and this change will \nallow the Governor to remove any member at will. \n \nThe all-payer claims database was never intended to be in this bill.  By removing the \nall-payer  claims  database,  it  removes  the  two-thirds  notation  on  the  bill.    Section  3, \nsubsection 1(b), sections 5 to 21, and sections 25 and 26 all deal with the establishment of the \nall-payer claims database.  Senate Bill 40 is the Commission's bill and deals with this issue.  \n \nSections 3, subsections 1(a) and (c), require the Commission to establish a plan to increase \npatients' access to their medical records and provide for the interoperability of medical \nrecords between providers of health care in accordance with HIPAA [Health Insurance \nPortability and Accountability Act] and other confidentiality laws and regulations.  It also \nmakes certain recommendations to the director and Legislature concerning the analysis, \navailability, and use of health care data. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nIn establishing subcommittees or working groups, item 4 of the conceptual amendment \n[Exhibit H] authorizes the Commission to establish any committees or working groups as \nnecessary, with the intent of providing a tool to take a deeper dive into certain policy areas.  \nThere  have  been  some  questions  about  whether  this  is  necessary  and  whether  the \nCommission already has this authority or whether we need to give this to the Commission.  \nI would leave that to your staff to make sure this is addressed.  If it is not clear in the original \nlanguage that established the Commission, we would like to make sure it is clear so if they \nestablish these working groups, that they have the authority to do the work they need to do. \n \nSection 24 of Assembly Bill 348 designates the Commission as the state entity for the \nPeterson-Milbank  Program  for  Sustainable  Health  Care  Costs.    This  Program  advances  \nstate-based efforts to make health care more affordable for residents, employers, and states. \n \nI have been working on health care issues for a very long time.  I came to it from the \nperspective of having really good health care and having to explain to my coworkers how \nhealth care actually works, how they should access their health care, and that it is a really \ngreat benefit to be able to have.  In this building for a number of years, we have debated a lot \nof bills on health care, and we have done that with a lot of anecdotes.  We need to have the \ndata.    The  PPC  and  the  data  components  that  are  involved  in  this  bill  will  give  this \nLegislature and future legislators the opportunity to analyze the real data, what is really \nhappening in health care in our state, and how we address the issues to make sure we have \ngood quality, affordable, safe health care for the citizens in this state.  I have met with the \nGovernor's staff and we have gone over a number of components in this bill.  This is not to \nsay the Commission did not do a good job.  I believe they did an excellent job for what was \nin front of them, but I also believe there were some missing pieces in the original bill.  We all \nknow these commissions are constantly evolving, so I hope A.B. 348 gives the Commission \nthe tools they need to continue to do the work they are doing. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo you think this bill with the amendment will give this Commission more flexibility?  You \ntalked about how it is a dynamic process.  Are we going to be here in two years expanding \nthe  responsibilities  of  this  Commission,  or  do  you  think  this  allows  for  some  of  that \nflexibility? \n \nAssemblywoman Carlton: \nWith the changes in the membership of this Commission and with a lot of other things going \non in the state as far as being able to collect more data about health care, I believe this gives \nthis Commission the opportunity to dig in and do some really great work and move forward.  \nIf there are other issues in the future, there is always an opportunity to reach out to the \nadministration and/or the Legislature to have a conversation about any other needs they \nmight have. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI appreciate all the hard work you have done looking into the cost of health care in Nevada.  \nLooking at your amendment [Exhibit H], I am glad you removed the section concerning the \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nall-payer claims database.  Under section 2 you list the membership, and you are changing \nfrom two representatives of providers to one member who is a provider of health care.  What \nis the definition of \"provider of health care\"?  Could it be a podiatrist, a masseuse, a social \nworker? \n \nAssemblywoman Carlton: \nSection  2,  the  membership  section,  lists  a  physician  or  registered  nurse  who  practices \nprimarily at a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC).  Are you asking about that or are \nyou referring to a registered nurse primarily practicing at a nonprofit hospital?  We are taking \n\"provider of health care\" and putting more parameters into it, trying to get to providers who \nwork in the nonprofit world or the FQHC world—folks who deal a lot with indigent care.  \nUnder section 2, it has a listing of the different folks we would like to see in the categories as \nmembers on the Commission.  Within that category, that person would fit in there. \n \nIf it is a nonprofit public hospital located in a county that spends the largest amount of money \non hospital care for indigent persons, I believe that is very clearly the University Medical \nCenter of Southern Nevada (UMC).  There is a representative from UMC now on the \nCommission.  That person's term is up on July 1 of this year, I believe.  If they want to be \nreappointed and resubmit their name again, or their designee, I believe they would fit into \nthis category moving forward.  We would have attrition from one set of members to the next.  \nThat way, that person would still have an opportunity to participate on this Commission and \nprovide expertise when it comes to hospital care for indigent individuals. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI appreciate that explanation, but it still does not appear clear under subparagraphs (1) and (2) \nof section 2, subsection 1, paragraph (a), because that picks up the nurse who practices \nprimarily at a nonprofit hospital, but you still have not defined the first one.  You have \ndefined a nurse, but you also have \"one member who is a provider of health care.\" \n \nAssemblywoman Carlton: \nMadam Chair, I am not tracking with Assemblywoman Titus.  I am working from the \nconceptual amendment. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThat is in the bill itself.  You did not change that section. \n \nAssemblywoman Carlton: \nRight.  I am trying to understand exactly what the question is.  If you look at the conceptual \namendment [Exhibit H], it lists all the folks.  If I go to the actual bill, on page 4, line 4, \"One \nmember who is a registered nurse who practices . . . .\"  If Assemblywoman Titus would like \nto point out between lines 4 and 27 what the question is. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI am looking at the actual bill.  I want to make sure there are members on this Commission \nwho have their own small business in health care; maybe they are for profit.  They do \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nadminister health care and we still have some folks in health care who do this privately.  \nMaybe it is a physical therapist who is a provider of health care with a physical therapy \npractice.  That is what I am getting at.  I am looking at the small provider of health care not \nassociated with a huge nonprofit, a huge hospital.  These people still have a lot to do with \noffering health care but from a different viewpoint.  I was wondering if a person like that \nwould fill in that spot—someone in the industry, privately, who has a business in health care. \n \nAssemblywoman Carlton: \nWe did not actually change that.  The way the appointments happen, anyone could put their \nname in for that.  I believe the PPC has a definition for that.  We have a registered nurse, we \nalso have anyone with experience advocating for the uninsured, so I am not sure about \ngetting that specific. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nSara Cholhagian is on the line, and we might be able to ask her or Ms. O'Krent with the \nLegislative Counsel Bureau's Legal Division to clarify the existing membership of the PPC if \nthat would be helpful. \n \nAssemblywoman Carlton: \nMy original confusion was trying to figure out exactly what the question is.  I do not believe \nthere is any significant change to the definition of \"provider of health care.\"  I believe we are \ntrying to aim at folks with different experience levels.   \n \nSara Cholhagian, Executive Director, Patient Protection Commission, Office of the \nGovernor: \nNevada  Revised  Statutes  439.908  currently  provides  for  the  Commission's  membership \noutline.  Now, there are two providers of health care, one academic or person in public \nhealth, two hospital representatives, two health insurers, one prescription drug representative, \none member of the general public, and two patient representatives. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI still have concerns and want to go on the record recognizing that perhaps that small \nbusinessperson in health care is not represented.  When you presented the bill, you stated that \nremoval of the all-payer claims database had removed the two-thirds requirement.  Did it \nremove the $7 million fiscal note? \n \nAssemblywoman Carlton: \nOh, yes.  That fiscal note was tied to the all-payer claims database. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there other questions from Committee members?  [There were none.]  Seeing none, \nI will begin testimony in support.  Assemblywoman Carlton, did you have anyone who will \nbe testifying in support? \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nAssemblywoman Carlton: \nNo, I did not line up anyone in particular.  I tried to be cognizant of the fact that I did not \nwant to put the current commissioners in an awkward position because of some of the \nchanges we are making.  I have had numerous conversations with folks about the bill and \nexplaining that there was a big conceptual amendment coming to especially address the \nall-payer claims database.  I did get a number of calls from folks who were in neutral. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI will now take testimony in support of A.B. 348.   \n \nMaya Holmes, Healthcare Research Manager, Culinary Health Fund: \nGovernor Sisolak's 2019 decision and the Legislature's support to create the PPC was truly an \nessential step to improve our health care system for all Nevadans.  Health care costs are \nrising at a staggering rate and are increasingly unsustainable for already strained patient, \nemployer, and public- and private-payer budgets.  The PPC's primary goal is examining and \nproposing solutions to address access, quality, and affordability in our health care system.  \nAll of the issues are shaped by health care costs.  We support A.B. 348 and Assemblywoman \nCarlton's amended proposal to ensure diversity of critical stakeholders in our health care \nsystem are represented on the Commission.  They will bring specific and much-needed \nexpertise that is so crucial to this Commission's work.  We also support the effort to address \nany conflicts of interest, adopt needed bylaws, and place the PPC within DHHS, which will \nprovide it with additional tools and structure to achieve its goals.  We also support Governor \nSisolak's decision to join the multistate Peterson-Milbank Program for Sustainable Health \nCare Costs to advance state efforts to address health care cost growth.  The Governor wants \npublic policy solutions to increase access to affordable quality health care in Nevada.  He is \nalso  deeply  concerned  and  committed  to  addressing  the  issue  that  over  50  percent  of \nNevadans, by population, are at risk of poor health outcomes.  Governor Sisolak asked the \nPPC to assist its Executive Director's work and for recommendations to develop a statewide \nhealth care cost growth benchmark, which other states are doing, to analyze cost growth and \nevaluate  cost  drivers.    Assembly  Bill  348  and  Assemblywoman  Carlton's  proposed \namendment will ensure that the PPC has the breadth of expertise, structure, and tools at its \ndisposal to address these critical issues.   \n \nStacie Sasso, Executive Director, Health Services Coalition: \nWe represent 25 employer- and union-sponsored health plans in southern Nevada.  While \ncost was a key pillar of the PPC, the Coalition is disappointed that one of its two bills is \nfocused on increasing telehealth reimbursement to doctors with no indication this would \nincrease access.  We are in support of A.B. 348.  When the Governor formed the PPC, it was \nwith the intention of protecting the patient with price focus being one of those topics.  The \nproposed nonprofit focus of the proposed changes supports the need to put the patients first \nin the Commission.  The Health Services Coalition is thankful for the PPC for the work they \nhave done thus far and are looking forward to continuing to watch and participate in the \nfuture. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nCan we go to our next caller in support of A.B. 348?  [There was no one.]  Let us go to any \ncallers in opposition to A.B. 348.   \n \nJesse Wadhams, representing Nevada Hospital Association: \nWe  have  spoken  with  Assemblywoman  Carlton,  and  she  walked  us  through  both  her \nrationale  for  the  bill  and  the  amendment.    The  Nevada  Hospital  Association  was  very \nsupportive of the creation of the PPC in 2019, and we agree with Assemblywoman Carlton's \nconceptual amendment.  Our opposition today is focused on the change of representation in \nsection 2 of the bill.  We believe these changes could actually be additive to the current \nmakeup and breadth of Commission members and continuing to add important voices to the \nconversation.  We appreciate the opportunity to work with Assemblywoman Carlton going \nforward on this language and look forward to the future processing of the bill. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any other callers in opposition to A.B. 348?  [There were none.]  Do we have \nany callers in neutral to A.B. 348? \n \nTom Clark, representing Nevada Association of Health Plans: \nWe recognize the hard work the PPC did in the interim.  Our concern is under section 2.  We \nappreciate  the  bill  recognizing  health  insurance  representation,  but  as  drafted,  the  bill \nchanges the health insurance representation from two folks to one. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe are taking testimony in neutral, but this sounds like it is opposition testimony.  I am \ngoing to let you continue your testimony regarding the bill as amended, but I am going to \nreclassify it. \n \nTom Clark: \nI am looking at section 2, subsection 1, paragraph (a), subparagraph (7) of the legislation that \ndefines the representative from a \"private nonprofit health insurer with the highest percentage \nof insureds in this State who are adversely impacted by social determinants of health.\"  We \nrespectfully request that we retain the two health insurance representatives, and that at least \none  of  those  private  insurers  be  regulated  by  Nevada's  Division  of  Insurance  in  the \nDepartment of Business and Industry under Title 57.  I apologize for any confusion. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI will again remind callers in neutral that you are neutral on the bill and you are not making \nsuggestions about changes or problems you have with the bill and the conceptual amendment \nas proposed today by Assemblywoman Carlton.  Can we now go to our next caller in neutral? \n \nSandie Ruybalid, Chief IT Manager, Division of Health Care Financing and Policy, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services: \nWe are neutral on the bill and want to reiterate that the fiscal note will be removed with the \nall-payer claims database provisions being removed. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nJaron Hildebrand, Executive Director, Nevada State Medical Association: \nI apologize to Assemblywoman Carlton that I have not had a chance to speak with her, as  \nI just received the conceptual amendment this morning.  I would like to say ditto to what \nTom Clark said.  We would like to see an additional provider added, keep our two positions \ncurrently on the PPC, and see if we could add the member who works for the FQHC.  We \nlook forward to reaching out to Assemblywoman Carlton to discuss this. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAgain, I will remind lobbyists what neutral testimony is; I will reclassify that as opposition \ntestimony.  Are there any more callers in neutral?  [There were none.]  I will turn this over to \nAssemblywoman Carlton for any closing remarks. \n \nAssemblywoman Carlton: \nI guess neutral is in the eye of the beholder.  I understand that the conceptual amendment just \ncame out today, so I can understand some of the confusion.  I did make numerous phone calls \nto folks to give them a heads-up, so I was a bit surprised by the opposition, as I did not get a \nreturn call saying that they were going to be opposed.  We will address that as we move \nforward. \n \nAs far as the gentleman from the medical association, these are still doctors; they just happen \nto be doctors in an area with an FQHC that has patients who are impacted more by some of \nthe health care issues that I believe the Commission is trying to get to.  I understand that \neveryone wants to have their seat at the table, and I am grateful that they all want to \nparticipate.  Sometimes it is very hard to get folks to show up.  I truly believe that in going \nthrough the membership of this and the evolution of this, we are addressing the voices the \nCommission  needs  to  be  able  to  get  good  quality  data  and  really  look  at  the  social \ndeterminants in our health care system that affect Nevadans as they try to stay healthy and \nmove forward. \n \nI am more than happy to have a conversation with them as we move forward.  We will keep \nworking on this and go from there.  Thank you for the hearing today, and I appreciate all the \nhard work your Committee does. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWith that, we will close the hearing on A.B. 348 and open the hearing on Assembly Bill 374.  \nThere were substantial amendments, and I believe you all received that document.  Welcome, \nAssemblywoman Tolles.  Please begin when you are ready. \n \nAssembly Bill 374:  Establishes requirements governing the expenditure of proceeds of \nlitigation relating to opioids. (BDR 40-991) \n \nAssemblywoman Jill Tolles, Assembly District No. 25: \nI am here to present Assembly Bill 374.  As Chair Nguyen mentioned, there is a proposed \nconceptual amendment [Exhibit I] on the Nevada Electronic Legislative Information System, \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nand I also emailed you a copy last evening.  Hopefully you have that as a reference, because \nthat conceptual amendment replaces the original text of the bill as introduced.  \n \nIn November 2020, the National Drug Helpline placed Nevada as one of 28 states on red \nalert status for increased risk of death from overdoses from opioids and other drugs.  The \nCOVID-19 pandemic has amplified the existing opioid crisis.  According to the Department \nof  Health  and  Human  Services,  Nevada  has  seen  a  50  percent  increase in  opioid-  and \nfentanyl-related overdose deaths since the onset of the pandemic.  The National Safety \nCouncil reports that overdoses kill more of us than breast cancer, guns, and car crashes \ncombined. \n \nLike so many in Nevada, and likely in this Committee, our family, too, has been impacted \nby this crisis.  One of our family members developed a dependency on pain meds after an \naccident at work.  That eventually turned into an addiction to other substances and tragically \nended  with  a  drug  overdose  just  days  before  Christmas  in  December  2007.    In  2017, \n626 Nevadans lost their lives, impacting countless brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, \nchildren, spouses, and friends.   \n \nAddiction is treatable and it is a preventable disease.  There are 23 million people in recovery \nin the United States today.  Recovery is not only possible, it is probable if one receives the \nright type of treatment and access to support services.  Assembly Bill 374 seeks to establish a \nstatewide substance use response working group under the Office of the Attorney General.  \nI would like to direct your attention back to the conceptual amendment.  As you know, the \nAttorney General announced that the state of Nevada received a $45 million settlement from \nan opioid-related case.  There are many other settlements currently pending at both the state \nand county levels.  Originally, this bill set up an advisory committee to help with the \noversight and distribution.  After this bill was introduced, I was made aware of another bill \nthat is being presented by the Committee on Health and Human Services in the Senate.  After \nspeaking  with  the  chair  of  the  Senate  committee,  and  realizing  that  bill  had  been  a \ncollaborative effort with the Department of Health and Human Services to administer those \nsettlement funds for specific programs, we reached out to other stakeholders in both the \nAttorney General's Office and the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as \nstakeholders in the recovery, treatment, and prevention community.  We received feedback \nthat  there  was  a  very  strong  cry  for  creating  a  sustainable  statewide  working  group, \ncollaborating to identify gaps, and employing evidence-based best practices to tackle issues \nof substance use disorder, behavioral health, and other co-occurring disorders in communities \nacross every county in the state. \n \nThis document before you is based on direct input from the Attorney General's Office, the \nDepartment  of  Health  and  Human  Services,  the  Nevada  Association  of  Counties, \nShatterproof, and representatives of the mental health and recovery prevention and treatment \ncommunity.  I would be remiss not to say a resounding \"thank you\" to all the stakeholders for \nthe input that went into the document before you today. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nStarting with section 1 of the amendment [page 1, Exhibit I], the first section establishes the \nNevada Statewide Substance Use Response Working Group.  The second section outlines the \nmembership of the group under the Office of the Attorney General.  Sections 3 through 6 \npertain to the service requirements and other functions of the working group.  Section 7 \n[pages 2-4] outlines the duties of the working group, including: \n \n•  Coordination of substance use prevention and reduction efforts. \n•  Recommendations to be presented for a statewide plan. \n•  Assessing treatment and recovery options. \n•  Reviewing Nevada's existing law enforcement programs. \n•  Examining qualitative and quantitative data on risk factors and rates within certain \npopulations and geographic regions. \n•  Developing strategies for implementation among local, state, and federal levels. \n•  Studying the efficacy of certain programs. \n•  Receiving annual reports from the Department of Health and Human Services on the \nuse of any settlement funds money received from a judgment of civil actions, state \nand local funds, and any grants or gifts received.   \n \nSection 7 also stipulates that the working group will submit a report to the Governor, the \nAttorney  General,  the  Advisory  Commission  on  the  Administration  of  Justice,  and  the \nDirector of the Legislative Counsel Bureau.   \n \nThe  final  point  in  section  8  makes  this  bill  effective  upon  passage  and  approval.  \nI acknowledge that this is a conceptual amendment and predict that our Legislative Counsel \nBureau will help refine the language as we put it into the appropriate statutes.  \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI  know  you  based  this  on  a  former  advisory  commission  or  committee  under  former \nGovernor Sandoval.  It looks as though you are proposing 16 members in this working group.  \nHow many members were part of the prior commission/committee? \n \nAssemblywoman Tolles: \nI appreciate your referencing a committee that was very similar in the past.  I know the \nstakeholders  were  very  appreciative  of  the  work  that  was  done.   That  was  part  of  the \nmotivation  for  creating  this  sustaining,  ongoing  working  group.    You  will  see  some \nsimilarities between some of the members of that committee, but it is not a direct replication.  \nThat is based on input regarding being sure we had stakeholders—not only at the agency \nlevel but also at the community level—with a personal stake in these issues, including \nmembers of the recovery community who provide services related to treatment of substance \nuse disorders, members of the SAPTA [Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Agency] \nteam, as well as someone in recovery and victims of substance use or family members who \nwere victims.  We felt it was important to make sure we had that diverse community input \ninto this work to give us a hands-on view.  If Stephanie Woodard is available to answer \nquestions, she can provide more of a comparison between the two. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nStephanie Woodard, Psy.D., Senior Advisor on Behavioral Health, Division of Public \nand Behavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services: \nThere are some pretty big lessons learned from having the Governor's opioid accountability \ntask  force  meeting,  as  you  mentioned,  and  the  makeup  of  that  meeting,  and  the  tasks \nundertaken with that group along with the previous substance abuse working group under the \nAttorney General's Office, in which I was able to participate the last two years prior to that \ncommittee sunsetting. \n \nWhat you see represented in this proposed legislation is representation we have identified as \nkey in supporting the activities this group would be tasked with:  knowing what we need for \nour state as it comes to collaboration and coordination—not just across grants but across \nprograms—and really understanding the data and what the data is telling us around what the \ngreatest areas of needs are in the state.  This group will then make informed proposals and \nrecommendations for an overall comprehensive state plan to address prevention, substance \nabuse treatment, and recovery support services.  How that impacts all the systems that \nsubstance abuse prevention, treatment, and recovery touch is a vitally important role for this \ncommittee to hold.  In the absence of a formal convening committee over the last couple of \nyears, it has been increasingly difficult for us to do this type of work.  Having a formal body \nto convene all the members—not only on this committee but additional stakeholders we also \nidentified as key—to engage in these conversations will help to take our plans for Nevada \nmuch further into the future. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there further questions from Committee members?  [There were none.]  Seeing none,  \nI will take testimony in support of A.B. 374. \n \nCourtney Hunter, Vice President, State Policy, Shatterproof: \nI am from the national nonprofit group Shatterproof, which is dedicated to reversing the \naddiction crisis.  We want to thank Assemblywoman Tolles, the Attorney General's Office, \nand Dr. Stephanie Woodard for putting this thoughtful task force together.  Assemblywoman \nTolles stated some of the research and statistics around fentanyl overdose deaths and what is \nhappening in the state of Nevada, and we want to be responsive to that.  We know what \nworks and we need a statewide response to help implement that. \n \nI  want  to  introduce  for  testimony  one  of  our  Shatterproof  ambassadors  from  the  state, \nKelsey Matthews.  She is the reigning Miss Las Vegas Volunteer 2021, and also the former \nMiss Battle Born 2019.  She is going to speak about her personal experience and why there is \nsuch a need for this bill. \n \nKelsey Matthews, Ambassador, Shatterproof: \nI am 22 years old and I am an ambassador for Shatterproof, a national nonprofit dedicated to \nreversing the addiction crisis.  I am also the founder of Treasuring Tracey, an addiction and \noverdose awareness platform created in memory of my mother, Tracey Matthews, who \npassed away of an accidental drug overdose in 2016.  I have been blessed to have been able \nto put my platform to use here in the Las Vegas community, working with organizations like \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nTeen Challenge, the Walter Hoving Home, Foundation for Recovery, and as a licensed \nvolunteer for Child Haven and Clark County Department of Family Services.  Currently, \nI serve on the board of directors for Hope Compassionate Healthcare, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit \norganization founded to provide comprehensive integrated health care and fill in the gaps \nfound in our health care system.  It is my life experience that has not only moved me to join \nthe fight against the addiction and opioid crisis but also inspired me to pursue both social \nwork and law degrees so that I can go on to make an even greater impact in the lives of \nothers.  \n \nAddiction is a family disease.  It is not just the person who is directly affected and who is \nimpacted, but the entire family unit suffers, and I can attest to that firsthand.  As a child,  \nI watched over my mother in her struggle with addiction, and I functioned as one of her \nprimary caretakers alongside my grandparents.  This continued until her death when I was \n17.  I have seen things no child should see.  I have witnessed my mother overdose repeatedly, \nsaved her life numerous times, and found myself at the hands of drug dealers, along with \ncountless other unimaginable events which ended with finding her dead in 2016.  The reality \nis this:  people are dying, families are broken, children are losing their parents, and parents \nare burying their children.  This crisis is a pandemic in and of itself, and we need to start \ngetting to the root of the problem in all forms. \n \nI was just a kid when my mother was struggling.  There was so much I did not know and \nunderstand, but now looking back, I can see there were clear issues and gaps in the system \nand those things still exist today.  In the times that my mother did look for help, there was a \nsevere lack of resources—whether it was receiving inadequate treatment from medical and \nmental  health  professionals,  being  stigmatized,  being  denied  care  due  to  insurance  and \nfinancial reasons, or treatment facilities and/or providers being understaffed or unprepared.  \nThis is the reality right here in our own communities.  The passing of this legislation is \ncrucial.  The creation of the statewide task force being proposed is a necessary action in the \nfight against the crisis.  In order to be successful, it is going to be a team effort.  Government \nofficials cannot do this alone.  We need a diverse team of people from different backgrounds, \nwalks of life, and parts of the state who possess real-life experiences with substance abuse.  \nThis is not a black or white issue with one easy fix or solution.  Getting to the root of this \nproblem is going to consist of many different things, including but not limited to: \n \n•  Promoting and providing adequate and specialized behavioral health treatment and \ncounseling so that people can deal with the types of issues that often lead to addiction \nlike trauma, abuse, neglect, or other mental health issues. \n \n•  Making sure we educate our medical providers properly to make sure that patients \nreceive quality treatment and to avoid misuse of prescription medication by providers. \n \n•  Having resources available to assist and support family and loved ones who are \ndirectly impacted by addiction. \n \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \n•  Implementing  and  utilizing  nonprofit  organizations  and  private  sector  funding \nalongside government agencies to better use these resources and find better results. \n \n•  And over all, providing people with quality care, treatment, and resources by creating \na statewide task force on this issue. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nMs. Matthews, will you please wrap up?  I see you have a written statement.  You may \nprovide that to the Committee. \n \nKelsey Matthews: \nBy creating a statewide task force on this issue, we are giving people a chance to be a part of \nthe solution.  Before they closed the casket on my mom, I told her this, \"We are not done \nhere.\"  I made her a promise that I would not allow her death to be in vain and that one day \nI would use her story, our story, to make a difference.  Thank you for having me here today \nand allowing me to do so. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe will now go to the phone lines for testimony in support. \n \nSean O'Donnell, Executive Director, Foundation for Recovery: \nThe Foundation for Recovery is a Nevada statewide recovery community organization—a \ncharitable nonprofit which is staffed, governed, and led by people in recovery from substance \nuse disorders from local communities across our state.  I am a person in recovery from \nsubstance use disorder who has lost close loved ones to opioid overdoses.  We are in support \nof A.B. 374, and I want to thank Assemblywoman Tolles for this piece of legislation.  It is \ncrucial that allocation of these funds be determined by a nonpartisan group of experts, \nvictims, and legislators.  I would, however, like to encourage the Committee to consider \nensuring  a  fair  and  balanced  representation  on  the  working  group  that  should  include \nadditional seats for the victims themselves who have been impacted by the opioid crisis.  \nThese may be people in recovery, bereaved parents, and family members.  Those who have \nbeen directly impacted and lost loved ones or their quality of life from these drugs should \ncomprise more than two seats.  Their lived experience provides a wealth of knowledge on the \nsolutions to help those in our community who are currently struggling. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nLet us go to our next caller on the line. \n \nJoanna Jacob, Government Affairs Manager, Clark County: \nI want to go on record in support of this bill with Assemblywoman Tolles' conceptual \namendment.  I want to thank Assemblywoman Tolles, the bill proponents, and everyone who \ncame together to recreate this substance abuse response working group.  The conceptual \namendment allows counties to be at the table as part of the critical work that is going to be \ndone  by  this  group.    We  believe  that  is  going  to  benefit  Clark  County.    I  appreciate \nAssemblywoman  Tolles  making  sure  we  are  at  the  table  to  partner  with  the  state  and \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \neveryone involved in this important work.  Thank you for your work on this and thank you to \nthe Committee for allowing me to speak.  We are in support. \n \nVinson Guthreau, Deputy Director, Nevada Association of Counties: \nThe Nevada Association of Counties supports A.B. 374 with the presented amendment, and \nwe want to thank the sponsor for including counties in this conversation and as members of \nthe response group.  All counties in Nevada have felt the impacts from the opioid epidemic in \ntheir communities and also in the services they provide to support the most vulnerable.  I just \nwanted to put that on the record and thank you for the opportunity to testify in support of \nA.B. 374. \n \nChristine  Jones  Brady,  Second  Assistant  Attorney  General,  Office  of  the  Attorney \nGeneral: \nI want to thank Assemblywoman Tolles for reaching out to us and all the stakeholders.  One \narea I work with at the Attorney General's Office is the Bureau of Consumer Protection, as \nwell  as  our  investigative  staff,  our  Medicaid  Fraud  Control  Unit,  and  our  criminal \nprosecution unit.  In that work in the community, I have had many requests over the last two \nyears to have a committee such as this.  It is very important.  This committee is like railroad \nbuilders.  They are building a railroad track across our entire state.  They are going to be well \npositioned with the people on it, as well as the people they will be consulting with, in order to \nput together a plan, analyze a plan, and give recommendations on a plan to combat substance \nuse in our state.  They will be able to bring together areas across the state—the rural  \nareas that currently do not have access, urban areas, and other underserved communities—\nAfrican-American populations that have been hard hit by this as well as Hispanic, LGBTQ, \nand other communities.  This is an important committee that will be working hand in hand \nwith the Department of Health and Human Services to combat a very aggressive problem we \nhave in our state.  The Attorney General's Office is proud to support it.  \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAt this time, I will go to testimony in opposition to A.B. 374.  [There was none.]  Do we \nhave any callers in neutral to A.B. 374?  [There were none.]  I will turn this back over to \nAssemblywoman Tolles for any closing remarks. \n \nAssemblywoman Tolles: \nThis means a lot to so many of us who have been impacted personally by this, and I am truly \ngrateful.  Thank you for having this hearing today, thank you for your interest in these issues, \nand for trying to find statewide collaborative solutions that truly do impact people's lives and \nfamilies. \n \nI appreciate that a few members have asked to join on as cosponsors, including the Chair of \nthis Committee as well as the Chair of the Senate Committee on Health and Human Services, \nSenator Julia Ratti.  I would be honored to have any of you join on as cosponsors for this \nlegislation.  If you would like to, please contact my office or email me directly.  Thank you \nso much, and I urge your support. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 5, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 374 and begin public comment.  Is there anyone waiting to \nmake public comment?  [There was no one.]  Are there any comments from Committee \nmembers?  [There were none.]  We are adjourned [at 3:04 p.m.]. \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n   \nTerry Horgan \nCommittee Secretary \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n   \nAssemblywoman Rochelle T.

The bill also requires the members of the Commission to \ncomply with certain requirements regarding disclosure of conflicts of interest and abstention \nfrom voting when certain conflicts arise. \n \nAssemblywoman Maggie Carlton proposes the following amendments to the bill, and see \nalso the revised conceptual amendment [page 2, Exhibit C]: \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \n1.  Remove  any  provisions  related  to  the  establishment  of  a  Patient  Protection \nCommission Advisory Committee and an all-payer claims database. \n2.  Restore the existing duties of the Patient Protection Commission that are deleted by \nthe introduced version of the bill.  \n3.  Revise the membership composition of the Commission to provide that:  \na.  One member who is a provider of health care must be experienced in running \na health care for-profit business; and  \nb.  One member with expertise in health care information technology and patient \naccess to medical records who must be either an employee or consultant from \nDHHS.  Committee members, I would like to clarify that this amendment does \nnot add any new members to the Commission but instead revises existing \nprovisions in the bill related to membership composition.  This amendment \nwas revised after the bill hearing on Monday.  \n4.  Authorize the Commission to establish any subcommittees or working groups as \nnecessary.  \n5.  Require the Commission to adopt bylaws governing its own operation.  \n6.  Provide that the Commission members serve at the pleasure of the governor, thereby \nallowing the governor to remove members at will. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nOne of the significant amendments that came out at the conclusion of the hearing is that \nAssemblywoman  Carlton  took  the  suggestion  of  Assemblywoman  Titus  to  include \nmembership for a for-profit provider.  Assemblywoman Carlton is here and available for \nquestions.  At this time, do any Committee members have any questions? \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI absolutely appreciate Assemblywoman Carlton's addition of a for-profit person on the \nCommission.  I think that is very helpful with getting appropriate data and input on this \nCommission and appreciate Assemblywoman Carlton listening to my suggestion.  I wish that \nwere the only issue I had with this bill; however, some health care folks whom I rely on are \nstill having some angst with this.  I want to let Assemblywoman Carlton and the other \nmembers of this Committee know that I am going to vote no on this, but if I can get \nreassurance from them after they have looked at the bill, I may change my vote on the floor.  \nAt this time, I am still going to be a no until I get other communications from these health \ncare workers. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any other questions from the Committee?  [There were none.]  Seeing none, \nI would entertain a motion at this time on Assembly Bill 348. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS MADE A MOTION TO AMEND AND DO \nPASS ASSEMBLY BILL 348. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  BENITEZ-THOMPSON  SECONDED  THE \nMOTION. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nTHE  MOTION  PASSED.    (ASSEMBLYMEN  BLACK,  HAFEN, \nKRASNER, MATTHEWS, AND TITUS VOTED NO.) \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI will assign that floor statement to Assemblywoman Carlton.  Next, we will move to \nAssembly Bill 287.   \n \nAssembly Bill 287:  Providing for the licensing and regulating of freestanding birthing \ncenters. (BDR 40-799) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \n[Patrick Ashton presented the work session document, Exhibit D].  On March 31, 2021, we \nheard Assembly Bill 287.  The bill provides for the licensure of freestanding birthing centers \nthrough the State Board of Health and requires the Board to adopt regulations necessary to \nprovide for such licensure. Additionally, A.B. 287 requires such a birthing center to be \nlocated within 30  miles of a hospital that offers certain pregnancy-related services and \nprohibits a center from performing surgery. Finally, the bill makes various other changes \nrelated to freestanding birthing centers to ensure that they perform certain screenings and \nreport certain information required to be performed or reported by other licensed facilities \nthat provide health-related and pregnancy-related services.  \n \nAssemblywoman Daniele Monroe-Moreno proposes to amend the bill as follows; see also the \nattached \"Proposed Amendment AB 287\" [pages 3-7, Exhibit D]:  \n \n1.  Revise Chapters 440, 442 and 449 of the Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) to replace \nthe term \"mother\" with the term \"birthing person,\" and authorize the Legal Division \nof the Legislative Counsel Bureau (LCB) to make conforming changes throughout \nNRS, as necessary. \n2.  Add a certified professional midwife and a certified nurse midwife as providers of \nhealth care throughout the bill wherever midwife is mentioned, and authorize the \nLegal Division of LCB to make conforming changes throughout NRS, as necessary.  \n3.  Revise Section 12, subsection 1(a) to require any regulations adopted for the licensure \nof  freestanding  birthing  centers  to  be  aligned  with  standards  established  by  the \nAmerican Association of Birth Centers and the accrediting body of the Commission \nfor Accreditation of Birth Centers or any other approved national accreditation body.  \n4.  Revise the requirement prescribed in subsection 2 to remove the requirement that a \nbirthing center must be located within a certain distance of a hospital that offers \nobstetric and nursery services, and instead provide that a freestanding birthing center \nmust be located within 30 miles of a hospital that offers obstetric and neonatal \nservices relating to pregnancy.  \n5.  Add a new subsection authorizing a freestanding birth center to serve as a supervised \ntraining facility for certain providers of health care.  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nOther amendments: \n  \n6.  Revise provisions relating to the investigation of birthing centers.  \n7.  Revise Section 22 to replace the term \"gender transition\" with \"gender reaffirming \nsurgery\" in subsection 1 of NRS 449.102. \n8.  Revise Section 23 to replace \"lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning \npersons\"  with  \"sexual  orientation  or  gender  identity\"  in  subsection  1(c)  of \nNRS 449.103. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any questions from Committee members?  [There were none.]  At this time, I will \nentertain a motion to amend and do pass Assembly Bill 287. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS MADE A MOTION TO AMEND AND DO \nPASS ASSEMBLY BILL 287. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN GORELOW SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nNow I will take any comments on the motion. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI am supportive of freestanding birthing centers.  I appreciate the comment during the \nhearing from Assemblywoman Peters that women should have the right to choose where they \nbirth a child.  My biggest heartburn with this bill is the fact that they can be 30 miles away \nfrom an obstetrical center.  As a family practitioner, I only delivered low-risk mothers, but \nhaving seen disasters that can happen in that group and knowing the importance of having \nassistance close by, I will have to be a no on this bill.  \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any other comments from Committee members regarding A.B. 287?  [There were \nnone.] \n \nTHE  MOTION  PASSED.    (ASSEMBLYMEN  BLACK,  HAFEN, \nKRASNER, MATTHEWS, AND TITUS VOTED NO.) \n \nI will assign the floor statement to Assemblywoman Monroe-Moreno. \n \nI will move on to our next work session bill, Assembly Bill 256.   \n \nAssembly Bill 256:  Provides for Medicaid coverage of doula services. (BDR 38-849) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \n[Patrick  Ashton  presented  the  work  session  document,  Exhibit  E].    We  heard \nAssembly Bill 256 on March 24, 2021.  The bill requires a doula who desires to provide \ndoula services for a Medicaid recipient to register with the Division of Health Care Financing \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nand  Policy  of  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services.    The  Director  of  the \nDepartment shall include in the State Plan of Medicaid a requirement that the state pay \ncertain costs for doula services provided to Medicaid recipients to the extent authorized by \nfederal law.  The Department shall apply for a waiver of federal Medicaid requirements or \nrequest to amend the State Plan to receive federal funding to provide coverage of doula \nservices. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong proposes to amend subsections 3 and 4 of section 1; \nsee also the attached amendment [page 2, Exhibit E]: \n \n1.  Remove the requirement that the Division adopt regulations prescribing the required \ntraining and qualifications for registration as a doula. \n2.  Revise requirements relating to persons who wish to receive reimbursement through \nthe Medicaid program for doula services to: \na.  Require such persons to submit to the Division an application for enrollment \nin Medicaid and include with the application proof of certain training and \nqualifications; and \nb.  Make conforming changes to the definition of \"registered doula\" to reflect that \nthese  persons  are  enrolled  with  Medicaid  rather  than  registered  by  the \nDivision. \n3.  Remove provisions authorizing the Division to charge a fee for registration of a \ndoula, thereby removing the requirement that a two-thirds majority vote is required \nfor the bill. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo any Committee members have questions regarding the bill?  [There were none.]  At this \ntime, I will accept a motion to amend and do pass. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN GORELOW MADE A MOTION TO AMEND AND \nDO PASS ASSEMBLY BILL 256. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nAre there any comments on the motion?  [There were none.] \n \nTHE  MOTION  PASSED.    (ASSEMBLYMEN  BLACK,  HAFEN, \nKRASNER, MATTHEWS, AND TITUS VOTED NO.) \n \nI will assign that floor statement to Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong.   \n \nNext, we will go to Assembly Bill 374.   \n \nAssembly Bill 374:  Establishes requirements governing the expenditure of proceeds of \nlitigation relating to opioids. (BDR 40-991) \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \n[Patrick  Ashton  presented  the  work  session  document,  Exhibit  F].    We  heard \nAssembly Bill 374 last Monday, April 5, 2021.  I will go straight to the summary of the \nproposed amendments: \n \n1.  Create the Nevada Statewide Substance Use Response Working Group within the \nOffice of the Attorney General. \n2.  Require the attorney general, Senate majority and minority leaders, the speaker of the \nAssembly, and the Assembly minority leader to appoint members to this working \ngroup. \n3.  Prescribe  the  duties  of  the  Nevada  Statewide  Substance  Use  Response  Working \nGroup, which must include requirements that the group: \n \na.  Leverage and expand current efforts to prevent and reduce substance use; \nb.  Make  certain  recommendations  relating  to  evidence-based  prevention  and \nintervention; \nc.  Evaluate existing policies and programs relating to treatment and recovery for \ncertain persons with substance use disorder; \nd.  Analyze and evaluate access to treatment and recovery supports for persons \nwith substance use disorders in Nevada; \ne.  Make certain recommendations relating to opioid prescription and persons \nwho are in recovery from opioid use disorders; \nf.  Analyze  qualitative  and  quantitative  data  relating  to  substance  use  and \naddiction in this state; \ng.  Make certain recommendations relating to drug overdoses; \nh.  Make recommendations relating to the sharing of certain information between \nlocal,  state,  and  federal  agencies  relating  to  certain  substances,  including \nheroin, opioids, and stimulants; \ni.  Analyze the manner in which substance abuse impacts the criminal justice \nsystem and the economy; \nj.  Study the effectiveness of criminal and civil penalties in preventing substance \nabuse  and  the  manufacture,  trafficking,  and  sale  of  commonly  abused \nsubstances; and \nk.  Submit certain reports to the Department of Health and Human Services, the \ngovernor,  the  attorney  general,  the  Advisory  Commission  on  the \nAdministration of Justice, and the Legislature. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any comments or questions at this time about the bill?  Assemblywoman Tolles is \non this call.  I believe there is a further amendment that did not make its way into the work \nsession document.  I will allow her to make that orally at this time. \n \nAssemblywoman Jill Tolles, Assembly District No. 25:  \nThank you again, Committee, for hearing this bill and for the support.  There were some \nindividuals who wanted to add on as cosponsors, and I apologize that the information did not \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nget into the work session document.  Senator Ratti, Assemblywomen Thomas and Peters, \nChair Nguyen, and Assemblymen Hafen and Orentlicher all wanted to be added on as \ncosponsors.  Of course, if anyone else would like to, I would welcome them as well. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any further questions?  [There were none.]  At this time, I will entertain a motion to \namend and do pass with the additional amendment of the listed cosponsors. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS MADE A MOTION TO AMEND AND DO \nPASS ASSEMBLY BILL 374. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN GORELOW SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nAre there any comments from Committee members before we move on?   \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nIf I want to be added on as a cosponsor, should I have done it before the motion? \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI am sure we can add your name during the amendment process.  I would encourage anyone \nelse who wishes to be added during the next few days to reach out to Assemblywoman Tolles \nand she will make sure you are included.  Are there further comments on the bill?  [There \nwere none.] \n \n  THE MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \nI will assign the floor statement to Assemblywoman Tolles. \n \nPatrick Ashton: \nWould you like Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong included in the motion right now to \nbe added as a cosponsor to the bill? \n \nChair Nguyen: \nLet us do that.  Assemblywoman Peters made the motion.  Do you have any problem \nincluding Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong in the motion to amend and do pass? \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nI intended to include the addition of Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong as a cosponsor in \nthat motion. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have a second, Assemblywoman Gorelow? \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nAssemblywoman Tolles: \nAssemblywoman  Gorelow  just  asked  if  she  could  join  as  well,  so  could  we  add  both \nAssemblywomen Summers-Armstrong and Gorelow in the same motion? \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe will do that right now.  If there are other people, I will ask that they be added as a \npersonal amendment on the floor.  Assemblywoman Peters, are you okay with amending \nwith both those individuals; and Assemblywoman Gorelow, would you second that? \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nYes, I will. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nSince I know we have unanimous support, all those in favor, please say \"Aye.\"  Anyone \nopposed say \"Nay.\"  That motion passes unanimously.   \n \nWith that, I will end our work session and we will move into our one bill presentation.  I will \nnow open the hearing on Assembly Bill 351.  We have Assemblyman Flores with us to \npresent A.B. 351. \n \nAssembly Bill 351:  Establishes provisions governing the prescribing, dispensing and \nadministering of medication designed to end the life of a patient. (BDR 40-882) \n \nAssemblyman Edgar Flores, Assembly District No. 28: \nI am here today to engage in what I hope will be a very thoughtful dialogue and at the same \ntime, one that I recognize to be a difficult dialogue, in presenting Assembly Bill 351.  First, \nI would like to give some context as to how I landed in what I believe is a responsibility to \nmove forward and push for this legislation.  There are two amendments posted on the Nevada \nElectronic Legislative Information System (NELIS).  There is a mock-up [Exhibit G] and \nthen  there  is  a  second  amendment  by  Washoe  County  [Exhibit  H].    Both  are  friendly \namendments.  So as not to jump back and forth between documents, I am going to focus on \nthe original document as introduced, and I will reference page numbers to that.  When I hand \nover the presentation to my copresenters, I will let them go through the amendments to \nexplain why we have them and what their objective is. \n \nI am incredibly grateful for the work of David Parks who, on three separate occasions, came \nforth on behalf of many Nevadans to be a voice for them in presenting similar measures in \nthe past.  I hope to be able to continue the work he laid down for Nevadans and that we can \ndeliver this for Nevadans.  I do so in respect and honor to his work. \n \nI do not think I would have engaged in this conversation years back.  Maybe it is because \nI grew up in a traditional Latino Catholic household where we talked about death, but the \nconversation about death was always within very specific parameters.  Or maybe it was \nbecause my age had not allowed me to experience enough of what death means in my family \nand how it impacts those around us.  As I get older, I am constantly reminded of my own \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nmortality, but more important, how limited the time is with those around me—those I love \nand care about. \n \nIn coming forward with this bill, what really sent it home for me was with a particular family \nmember.    I  remember  when  he  was  diagnosed  with  his  terminal  illness.    It  was  very \ndevastating and incredibly difficult, but more important, he fought every second.  I, in a very \nselfish way, applauded him.  I think the reason I did was because for a long time, death was \nalways associated with how it related to me.  I realized I needed to go on the other side of \nthat conversation.  It hit me then:  It is not about me, it is not about you, it is not about the \nfamily member, it is not about how everybody in that room feels, but rather, it is about that \nindividual who suffered every second, whom we selfishly applaud as we sit there.  We saw it \nas an act of valor to say, You are doing that for us; but what about your pain?  That delivered \nit home for me; and I said, \"Understood.  I have a responsibility.\"  Even if this bill had \nexisted, that person could very well have made that exact choice because this does not force \nanybody to do anything.  But it gives them the power at that very painful reality to say they \nhave a choice about whether they are going to continue suffering or whether they can endure \nanother second of that terminal illness.  So I am here.  I think the pandemic also put so much \ninto perspective for me.  I realize we have a responsibility to engage in very difficult convos.  \nIn respect and honor of them, I said, \"Let's do it,\" so I present this now.  I needed you to see \nme getting to why I wanted to engage.  Now that we have an understanding there, I would \nlike to speak broadly as to the actual language and what we are doing. \n \nI have had an opportunity to speak to numerous Nevadans in every corner of Nevada.  I am \nso grateful to those wonderful convos I have had with so many folk reaching out, in such \npainful stages that they may find themselves in, or their families, to speak up and say, \"We \nneed to have this very real conversation about what it means to have a bill like this.\"  Some \nof these folk are very healthy Nevadans.  They have broken it down to me, saying that they \njust want to know that if they are ever diagnosed with a terminal illness, and that after \nexploring every single traditional option, they know a legal, safe, and peaceful option is \navailable to them to take control of the end of their life and they do it on their own terms.  \nThis goes to the very core of our individual rights to be able to say, \"I no longer wish to \nsuffer anymore.\"  \n \nI do not want this conversation to be hijacked into something that is not real.  This is not a \nquestion about choosing between living and dying.  This bill is about having control and a \nchoice at the moment of dying.  This legislation allows a terminally ill, mentally capable \nadult who is a resident of Nevada with a prognosis of six months or less to live, to have the \noption to request, obtain, and take medications, should they choose, to die peacefully in their \nsleep if their suffering becomes unbearable.  This is not something new.  This bill is modeled \nafter the Oregon Death with Dignity Act, which has been in practice for more than 20 years, \nand there has not been a single instance of abuse or coercion in that state.  Now, collectively, \nwe have more than 40 years of evidence and cumulative data with medical aid in dying in \nOregon  and  nine  other  authorized  jurisdictions.    One  in  every  five  Americans—about \n22 percent—now have access to this compassionate, end-of-life care option because nine \nstates have authorized something similar:  California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nNew Jersey,  Oregon,  Vermont,  and  Washington;  and  Washington,  D.C.    In  addition, \nNew Mexico  passed  legislation  in  March,  and  the  governor  is  scheduled  to  sign  a  bill \ntomorrow, April 8, to enact it into law. \n \nWe cannot forget that only the dying person can determine how much pain and suffering is \ntoo much.  This law puts the decision in the hands of the dying person, in consultation with \ntheir doctor and their loved ones—or it should be for such a deeply personal health care \ndecision.    This  is  their  deciding  that.    They  should  have  the  opportunity  to  talk  with \neverybody, get all the medical professionals involved, speak with all the family, make their \npeace with whomever.  But at the very end, they should have the choice. \n \nRather than walk you through the original bill line by line, I will reference sections and walk \nyou through the page numbers those sections fall in.  On page 5, a new section is being \ncreated in Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 440.  Section 1 talks about and specifies \nthat a coroner, coroner's deputy, or local health officer is not required to certify the cause of \ndeath resulting from the self-administration of medication that is designed to end the life of a \npatient pursuant to this bill. \n \nSection 2, which falls between pages 5 and 6, requires a death certificate to list the terminal \ncondition of the patient as a cause of death of a patient and must not mention that the patient \nself-administered such medication.  Section 3, page 6, prohibits a coroner, coroner's deputy, \nor local health officer from investigating such a death under certain circumstances and \nspecifies the cause of death is not required to be certified.  Sections 4 through 30, which fall \non pages 6 through 18, you will see a whole host of different definitions.  Specifically, you \nwill read in section 6 the definition of \"attending physician\"; in section 7, the definition of \n\"competent\"; in section 8, \"consulting physician\"; in section 9, the definition of \"Division\"; \nin section 10, the definition of \"health care facility\"; in section 11, the definition of \"person \nprofessionally qualified in the field of psychiatric mental health\"; and section 12 defines \n\"terminal condition.\" \n \nSection 13 on page 7 talks about the requirements in order to authorize a patient to request \nthat his or her physician prescribe such a medication if a patient:  \n \n1.  Is at least 18 years of age; \n2.  Has been diagnosed with a terminal condition by at least two physicians; \n3.  Is a Nevada resident; \n4.  Has made an informed and voluntary decision to end his or her own life; \n5.  Is competent; and \n6.  Is  requesting  the  medication  and  is  not  doing  it  because  of  coercion  or  undue \ninfluence. \n \nIt is incredibly important to make sure these are the parameters.  Again, we want to remind \neverybody that no one is obligated to do anything.  In fact, you will hear our copresenters \ntalk about how many folks, while in this situation, have decided to utilize this option, and \nyou will realize it is not as many as you think. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nNext, in section 14 on pages 7 and 8, it requires that to fulfill certain requirements to request \nsuch a medication, the patient must make two verbal requests and one written request for the \nmedication, and that the written request for the medication must be signed by a witness. \n \nSection 15, which falls on pages 8 and 9, prescribes the form a patient must complete to \nrequest such a medication.  Section 16, pages 9 and 10, imposes certain requirements before \na physician is allowed to prescribe such a medication, including that the physician must: \n \n1.  Inform the patient of his or her right to revoke a request for medication at any time; \n2.  Determine and verify that the patient meets the requirements for making such a \nrequest; \n3.  Discuss  certain  relevant  factors  with  the  patient,  including  the  diagnosis  and \nprognosis of the patient and alternative options for care; \n4.  Refer the patient to a consulting physician who can confirm diagnosis, prognosis, \nand competence of the patient, and that the patient has not been coerced or unduly \ninfluenced; \n5.  Instruct the patient against self-administering the medication in public. \n \nIn the mock-up amendment [Exhibit G], you will see an amendment in section 16.  We are \nadding something else to that list and will explain later. \n \nSection 17 on page 10 requires a physician to refer a patient to a qualified mental health \nprofessional and to receive confirmation about the patient's competence, if the physician \ndetermines that a patient who has requested a prescription for such a medication may not be \ncompetent.  This is important because all of this goes to the heart of the conversation I have \nhad with some of you and that I have heard a lot of concern about, which is, how do we \nensure  that  an  individual  understands  what  they  are  doing?    I  agree  100  percent \nwholeheartedly.    All  those  other  states  that  have  engaged  in  this  agree  with  you \nwholeheartedly.  The 22-plus years of working in this area by many medical physicians will \ntell you that is very important to them and that is why we built these safeguards in place—to \nensure that folk understand exactly what they are doing. \n \nSections  18  through  19  on  page  11  prescribe  certain  procedures  for  the  issuance  of  a \nprescription for such a medication and provide that only an attending physician or pharmacist \nmay  dispense  such  a  medication.    Section  19  prohibits  an  attending  physician  from \nprescribing such a medication based solely on the age or disability of the patient.  Section 20 \nrequires certain health care providers to include certain information concerning requested \nprescriptions for, and the dispensing of, such a medication in the patient's medical record, \nand requires that the physician or health care facility that previously provided care to a \npatient transfer the medical records to a new physician or health care facility. \n \nSection 21 allows a patient to revoke a request for such a medication at any time.  Again, if \nyou request it and later change your mind, that is perfectly okay and allowable.  Section 22 \non page 12 provides that only the patient to whom such a medication is prescribed may \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nadminister the medication.  You will see an amendment in that section that our copresenters \nwill briefly touch upon.   \n \nPages 12 through 13 address section 23, which describes certain information that must be \nreported  to  the  Division  of  Public  and  Behavioral  Health  (DPBH)  in  the  Department \nof Health  and  Human  Services  relating  to  the  patient  who  has  been  prescribed  or \nself-administered  such  a  medication;  makes  such  information  confidential  with  certain \nexceptions; and requires DPBH to complete an annual review of a sample of the reports.  \nSection 24 requires DPBH to compile an annual report concerning the implementation of the \nbill.    Section  25  on  pages  13  and  14  provides  that  the  death  resulting  from  a  patient \nself-administering such a medication in accordance with this bill does not constitute suicide \nor homicide.  This goes to ensure it is noted that it is the underlying illness that is the cause \nof death.  Section 26 on page 14 prohibits a person from preventing a patient from making or \nrevoking or requiring a patient to make or revoke a request for medication that is designed to \nend the life of a patient as a condition of receiving health care. \n \nSection 27 makes it a category A felony to engage in certain fraudulent or coercive acts \nintended to cause a person to self-administer such a medication.  Section 28 clarifies that a \nphysician is not required to prescribe such a medication, but that the physician must provide \ninformation concerning the prescription and self-administration of such a medication or refer \nthat patient to another health care provider.  It also provides that a pharmacist is not required \nto fill a prescription for or dispense such a medication.  Pages 15 and 16 address section 29, \nwhich allows the owner or operator of a health care facility to prohibit an employee or \nindependent contractor of a health care facility or any person who provides services on the \npremises of the health care facility from providing any services relating to prescribing a \nmedication that is designed to end the life of a patient while acting within the scope of his or \nher employment or contract with the facility or while on the premises of the facility. \n \nSection 29 is important because it is important to make it abundantly clear that no health care \nfacility has to engage in any particular conversation that we are engaging in this bill.  If there \nis a health care facility that wishes not to engage, that is something that can occur.  I want \nthat to be abundantly clear because I know there were a lot of concerns and questions around \nthat issue.  Section 30 prohibits a health care facility, provider of health care, or professional \nassociation  from  taking  certain  actions  against  an  employee,  independent  contractor,  or \nmember who provides accurate information concerning end-of-life care to a patient within or \noutside the scope of employment, contract, membership as applicable, or facilitates the \nprescription or self-administration of medication that is designed to end the life of the patient \noutside the scope of the employment, contract, or membership, as applicable. \n \nSection  30,  pages  16  through  18,  is  also  important  because  there  has  been  concern \nnationwide as to how accurate the information is that is being disseminated in some of these \nfacilities.  It is imperative that we recognize we are giving clear and accurate information, \nand that is what this section seeks to address.  Section 31, page 18, addresses NRS 453.256 \nspecifically to prescriptions.  It makes conforming changes by including the dispensing of a \nmedication  that  is  designed  to  end  the  life  of  a  patient  and  the  definition  of  \"medical \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \ntreatment.\"    Section  32  addresses  NRS  453.375,  which  is  the  authority  to  possess  and \nadminister controlled substances.  Section 32 makes conforming changes by excluding a \npatient requesting such a medication from the list of persons who may possess and administer \na controlled substance.   \n \nSection 33, pages 20 through 23, addresses NRS 454.213, which is the authority to possess \nand administer a dangerous drug, and makes conforming changes by excluding a patient \nrequesting such a medication from the list of persons who may possess and administer a \ndangerous  drug.    Section  34  addresses  NRS  454.215  and  is  the  authority  to  dispense \ndangerous drugs.  It makes conforming changes by excluding a patient requesting such a \nmedication  from  the  list  of  persons  who  may  possess  and  dispense  a  dangerous  drug.  \nSection 35 addresses NRS 133.065, which talks about conditional device and appointment.  \nSection 35 also prohibits a person from preventing a patient from making or revoking, or \nrequiring a patient to make or revoke a request for medication that is designed to end the life \nof the patient as a condition in an agreement, contract, or will. \n \nSection 36, page 24, addresses NRS 159.054.  It provides that a proposed protected person \nshould not be deemed to be in need of a general or special guardian solely because the \nproposed protected person requested a medication that is designed to end his or her life or \nrevoke such as request.  Section 37 addresses NRS 239.010 and addresses confidential \ninformation in public books and records and makes conforming changes to ensure certain \ninformation  is  confidential.    Section  38  on  pages  27  and  28  addresses  NRS  598.0923, \ndeceptive trade practices.  It makes it a deceptive trade practice for a health care provider or \nan owner, officer, employee, or independent contractor of a health care facility to knowingly \nengage in any false, misleading, or deceptive conduct concerning the willingness of the \nprovider  or  health  care  facility  to  take  certain  action  relating  to  the  prescription  and \nself-administration of a medication that is designed to end the life of the patient. \n \nSection 39, pages 28 and 29, address NRS 639.1375 and clarify that an advanced practice \nregistered nurse is not authorized to prescribe a medication that is designed to end the life of \na patient.  Section 40 addresses NRS 639.2351 and makes conforming changes to clarify that \nan advanced practice registered nurse is not authorized to prescribe a medication that is \ndesigned to end the life of a patient.  Section 41 addresses NRS 639.238, which is in regard \nto prescriptions not being public records, and makes conforming changes to ensure some \ninformation  is  confidential.    Sections  42  and  43  address  NRS  Chapter  688A  and \nChapter 688B.  These are new sections that prohibit insurers from refusing to sell, provide, or \nissue a policy of life insurance or group life insurance or annuity contract, or charging a \nhigher rate because a person makes or revokes a request for a medication that is designed to \nend  the  life  of  the  person  who  self-administers  such  a  medication,  or  conditioning \nlife insurance benefits, group life insurance benefits, or the payment of claims on whether \nthe insured makes, fails to make, or revokes a request for a medication that is designed to \nend the life of the insured or self-administers such a medication.  Section 44 addresses \nNRS 688B.040 and makes conforming changes reflecting the prohibitions in sections 42 and \n43 on the policy of group life insurance.  Section 45 on page 33 requires DPBH, to make the \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nprescribing forms in the bill available not later than 45 days after the effective date of the bill.  \nLast, section 46 specifies that this bill becomes effective upon passage and approval. \nI will now hand the presentation over to Kim Callinan. \n \nKim Callinan, President & CEO, Compassion & Choices: \n[Kim Callinan submitted written testimony, Exhibit I, and supplemental information after the \nhearing, Exhibit J].  I am the president and CEO of Compassion & Choices action network.  \nAs Assemblyman Flores noted, the legislation is modeled after the Oregon Death with \nDignity Act.  We have more than 20 years' experience in Oregon, and we have a combined \n60 years of experience across the other nine states and Washington, D.C.  This bill includes \nthe same strict eligibility criteria and core safeguards that are in all the other bills that have \nbeen proven to find that balance between ensuring that vulnerable populations are protected \nbut also making sure that this compassionate option is available to those who want it.   \n \nIt is entirely optional for everybody, for the doctor, for the patient, for the health care facility.  \nNobody is forced to participate, and the availability of the option brings people comfort \nduring a very difficult time.  As Assemblyman Flores noted, this is for a really small group of \npeople.  A person has to be an adult, mentally capable, terminally ill, have a prognosis of six \nmonths or less to live.  That is very important.  It is tied to the prognosis in hospice, so \npeople are not choosing between death and care.  They do have hospice care available to \nthem if this is an option that they do not want to afford themselves.  One key criterion is that \nthe person must be able to self-ingest the medication so that they are always maintaining \ndecision-making authority and are capable and able to change their minds at any point. \n \nOne amendment Assemblyman Flores mentioned will strengthen the language being used \naround self-administration to make it very clear that only the qualified patient is able to self-\nadminister the medication and that it can only go through ingestible means.  This amendment \nwill align your bill more directly with the other authorized states and is a very important \nsafety feature.  The law also has more than two dozen additional regulatory requirements.  \nWhen you look at that bill, there are a lot of steps that a patient has to go through.  Two \ndoctors have to certify that the person meets the requirements.  The person makes three \nseparate requests:  two oral and one written.  There are two witnesses who have to confirm \nthat the person is making this request voluntarily.  There is a 15-day waiting period and there \nis mandatory reporting by doctors. \n \nAll the provisions in this bill are on top of all the other regulations that govern the practice of \nmedicine, so one of the things that is important with this legislation is you want to have \nenough safeguards in play that it ensures that vulnerable populations are protected.  You also \nwant to be sure you are giving your medical providers the ability to actually support their \npatients.  You are really striking a fine line, and this legislation helps ensure that a small \nnumber of people will be able to access it.  It also includes a requirement for a lot of \neducation  of  the  patient  before  they  afford  themselves  of  this  option.    The  attending \nphysician must discuss with the patient the importance of having another person present \nwhen  the  patient  self-administers  the  medication  and  they  must  review  the  benefits  of \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nnotifying  the  patient's  next  of  kin  of  his  or  her  decision  to  request  a  prescription  for \nmedication that is designed to end the patient's life.   \n \nAn additional proposed amendment for your consideration which we are in support of is that \nthe doctor should also counsel the patient about the benefits of discussing their decision to \nrequest the medication with their religious, faith, spiritual, or support leader.  That is another \nprovision being recommended and this would be the only bill in the nation that includes that \nprovision, but it is a good addition to the legislation. \n \nAs I mentioned, on top of all the provisions of this bill, you also have the practice of \nmedicine that governs this and the standard of care that has been developed.  Your own \nAssemblyman, Dr. David Orentlicher, is the lead author for a peer-reviewed Journal of \nPalliative Medicine article that was published in 2016 which outlines the clinical criteria \naround medical aid in dying. \n \nAssemblyman Flores spoke about how you will be surprised that very few people choose to \nuse the law, and this is really important.  Across all the authorized jurisdictions, across all 50 \nor 60 years of data, there have only been about 4,300 people who have chosen to use the law.  \nIt is a really, really small number, so the concern that large numbers of people are going to \nuse this law—that is not the reality in practice.  It has not been in any of the authorized states.  \nIt is far fewer than 1 percent of people.   \n \nOf course, then the question becomes, if so few people are choosing to use the law, then why \nspend all this time authorizing this as an option?  It is not just about the small number of \npeople who choose to use the law, it is about all the people who get the peace of mind of \nknowing that, should their suffering become too great, they have an option.  We also know \nthat when the law gets implemented, what the evidence and data show—and there is a \nJournal of Medical Ethics report that showed this—is that there is no concern about abuse, \ncoercion, or misuse.  The report concluded that assisted dying did not pose any heightened \nrisk for any population, including vulnerable populations such as the elderly, the uninsured, \nand those who are physically disabled. \n \nThis law provides profound peace of mind to those who choose the law.  A third of the \npeople who get the prescription will never take it, but they get profound peace of mind \nsimply knowing the  medication is there and they have the option should they need it.  \nResearch from a Journal of Palliative Medicine article demonstrated that medical aid in \ndying also improves end-of-life care generally by contributing to more candid conversations \nbetween  doctors  and  patients,  higher  hospice  usage  rates,  and  improved  palliative  care \ntraining for physicians.   \n \nBecause  we  now  have  so  much  evidence  and  data,  we  also  are  seeing  this  movement \ngrow across the country.  Tomorrow, as Assemblyman Flores mentioned, the governor of \nNew  Mexico  is  planning  on  signing  legislation  to  make  that  the  tenth  state,  eleventh \njurisdiction,  to  authorize  medical  aid  in  dying.    What  is  key  is  that  seven  of  those \njurisdictions have taken place in the last six years.  Polling data which was just completed in \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nyour state last month shows that Nevada voters want this compassionate option; three out of \nfour residents support passage of medical aid in dying, including widespread support across \nall demographic groups.  We have seen that over the past six years, 30 national and state \nmedical professional associations have endorsed or dropped their opposition to medical aid in \ndying in support of the growing reality that this is something the American public wants.  \nThe Nevada State Medical Association has taken a neutral position on medical aid in dying.  \n \nWe  no  longer  have  to  hypothesize  about  what  is  going  to  happen  when  this  law  gets \nimplemented.    The  evidence  is  very  clear:    medical  aid  in  dying  protects  vulnerable \npopulations; it affords dying people autonomy and compassion during the most difficult time; \nit improves end-of-life care generally by resulting in more conversations about hospice care \nand improved palliative care training; and it costs almost nothing to implement.  The cost of \ninaction, however, is truly immense.  Without the option of medical aid in dying, terminally \nill individuals may not try that one last miracle treatment because often it is the treatment \nitself that causes the most amount of suffering.  They are afraid to try that one last treatment \nwithout knowing that they have this option available.  They may also choose violent means \nto  end  their  suffering,  and  they  could  experience  needless  agony  when  they  die  while \nfamilies and doctors remain powerless with no legal way to respond to their pleas for help.   \n \nTerminally ill residents do not have the luxury of endless deliberations.  They need the relief \nthis law affords them right now.  Not a single additional person will die if you authorize \nmedical aid in dying, but far fewer will suffer.  On behalf of our thousands of supporters \nacross the state, supporters like Hannah Olivas who need this option right now, I urge you to \nlet the evidence, the data, the strong public support for this end-of-life care option guide your \npolicy making, and pass this bill this session. \n \nPeg Sandeen, Executive Director, Death with Dignity National Center: \nI am a social worker and live in Portland, Oregon.  I have been working on death with dignity \nfor 16 years.  I am pleased to be able to share my experience with you.  As a social worker \nwho has built a career caring for and working with people who are dying, I want to reflect on \nthe vulnerability and honesty with which Assemblyman Flores shared his story with us today.  \nI hear stories like this every day—about people who are dying; people who would qualify for \nOregon's Death with Dignity Act or people who do not.  One thing that it is important to \nremember is that we all get one death and we all deserve an option like death with dignity.  \n \nOne of the most difficult things for a terminally ill individual is the silence—the silence \nsurrounding the dying experience—and the silence arises out of society's unwillingness to \nface death directly.  I know at least one family in the state of Nevada tonight will have a \ndifficult conversation about dying, last wishes, and advanced directives because they were \nsomehow engaged with or heard about this hearing today.  That is meaningful.  What is also \nmeaningful is the care with which this bill before you has been constructed.  We have ten \nother jurisdictions with death with dignity bills.  What I know is that this bill in front of you \nrepresents  the  best  of  all  those  pieces  of  legislation.    It  provides  strong,  time-proven \nsafeguards which have been well covered by Assemblyman Flores.  These safeguards protect \nvulnerable individuals from coercion and at the same time, these safeguards do not act as \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nbarriers to access for those who need it.  This bill strikes a tension between protection and \naccess and this tension is difficult to strike, and our team in Nevada has worked with all the \nnecessary stakeholders to get this bill just right. \n \nThe proposed law you are considering today is at its core a medical standard of care, so when \nyou go through section by section, you can see what a physician has to do in order to \nprescribe medication to a patient who requests a hastened death.  By enacting this law, the \nNevada Legislature will send a strong message that a compassionate response to suffering is \navailable in the state through medical aid in dying, but that health care providers must follow \nthe  carefully  regulated  safeguards  you  are  considering  today.    Assembly  Bill  351  puts \ndecisions about easing suffering in the hands of terminally ill patients, allowing them to \nengage  their  family  members,  their  physicians,  clergy  members,  and  anyone  else  they \nchoose—if they so choose.  It sets aside outdated and archaic government bans on a medical \npractice  that  is  currently  legal  for  72  million  Americans,  a  practice  that  is  validated, \nresearched, effective, and full of safeguards to protect vulnerable populations. \n \nNevada has considered similar legislation in the past, and those of you who have engaged in \nthis debate in prior sessions know you will hear a lot of negative accusations about this bill.  \nFor more than two decades now, we have heard these same slippery slope arguments—the \nstatement that this law will target individuals who are poor, living with disabilities, the \nelderly—statements suggesting that those without medical care or access to health care \nresources will be forced to end their lives using medical aid in dying because it is cheaper \nthan  treating  cancer.    These  slippery  slope  arguments  are  just  not  true.    Independent \nresearchers have concluded that the results are quite the opposite. \n \nOne  group  of  researchers  explored  data  out  of  Oregon  to  determine  if  there  was  a \ndisproportionate impact on ten groups of potentially vulnerable patients.  The data led the \nresearchers to conclude, and I quote, \"There is no current factual support for so-called \nslippery slope concerns about the risks of legalization of assisted dying.  These patients are \nnot at risk.\"  I have already read letters to the editor published in Nevada suggesting that \ndeath with dignity will undermine hospice and palliative care services, and the researchers \nare clear on this point also.  In a study published in the Journal of Palliative Medicine, \nresearch concluded, and I quote, \"Another concern regarding the legalization of physician-\naided dying is that physician-aided dying would become a substitute for quality end-of-life \ncare.  This study adds to the evidence that the choice to pursue physician-aided dying does \nnot appear to be due to or a reflection of poor end-of-life care.\"   \n \nWhat we do know for the states that have enacted death with dignity laws, the point is that \npeople have access to death with dignity and hospice care.  It is not one or the other.  The \ndata demonstrate that they come together in all the jurisdictions that have enacted death-with-\ndignity legislation.  A lot of people want to speak against the Oregon experience, and you \nwill probably hear that today, but in almost every legislative hearing I have attended, these \npeople are not from Oregon.  I have worked in this state; I am an Oregonian and I have \nworked with people who have used this law for almost 20 years.  Oregon's law works as \nintended—to give dying and suffering patients more options at the end of life.  I very much \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nappreciate Assemblyman Flores and all the work he and countless others from Nevada have \ncontributed to bring this important bill to you today, and my organization and I as a social \nworker stand ready to help Nevada enact and implement this critical piece of end-of-life care \nlegislation, should our support be necessary. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe do have questions, and we will start with Assemblyman Matthews. \n \nAssemblyman Matthews: \nIt has been noted that this bill has been modeled with Oregon's Death with Dignity Act, and \nI also know the stated intent of this bill is to provide options to those who are suffering and \nthose who are experiencing unbearable pain.  The Oregon Health Authority's own data \nsummary on that state's Death with Dignity Act notes that in most cases, current pain or even \nconcern about future pain is not cited by patients as a reason for obtaining these drugs.  But \nrather, the number one reason listed by patients to die from assisted suicide is being a burden \nto family and friends and loss of enjoyment in the usual activities.  Given the intent of this \nbill, what safeguards, if any, are in place to ensure we do not see the same thing happen here \nin Nevada? \n \nKim Callinan: \nIt is important to remember that Oregon data is coming from a doctor filling out a form about \ntheir perception of why the patient is choosing to use the option.  It is not the patient's self-\nreported reason for choosing the option.  Also, when you are talking to a patient who is at the \nend of life, it is not just about pain, but it is about all the pain and suffering they are \nexperiencing.  Assemblyman Flores spoke to it so beautifully in the beginning when he \ntalked about his own personal experience watching his loved one who was going through \nthis.  A person who is at the end of their life, they are going through a whole host of things.  \nIt is the totality of that experience that determines whether they are suffering too much.  \nReally, only the dying person can decide how much suffering is too much.  I do not see the \nOregon data as a problem.  It is a very small number of people who choose the option.  They \nare getting peace of mind in knowing that they do not have to suffer from whatever their \ndefinition of suffering is.  Again, they are terminally ill; they are already going to die; the \nquestion is how they die and not if they are going to die. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nMy question has to do with our Black, Brown, and people of color who at times have had a \ndiscouraging experience with health care personnel.  Is there any data showing that people \nwho are in a minority have experienced a reception of the same outcome as with dignity \nwhen they decided that life was enough for them?  Are they discouraged when it comes to \naccepting this as a final episode in their life's journey? \n \nKim Callinan: \nWe share your commitment to health equity at life's end and have an initiative going with our \nAfrican-American and Latino leadership councils to try to address the systemic inequities \nthat exist in end-of-life care broadly because they are pretty profound and it is across the \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nentire end-of-life care spectrum—hospice, palliative care, pain management.  Unfortunately, \nBlack and Brown Americans are less likely to enroll in hospice care and get adequate pain \nmanagement and all the things you are referencing.  That is a huge commitment and priority \nfor the organization.  In terms of this bill, what ends up existing, if you look at the data, is \nthat very few minorities take advantage of the option.  One of the things that is positive and \ngood about the initiative is that everything is self-directed.  The person has to make the \nrequest; they are in charge of the process from start to finish.  With this end-of-life option, \nthere is not a chance that a person is going to be coerced into using the option because it is \nentirely self-directed.  What we see is that a lot of public education is needed in order to \nensure that African Americans, Latinos, other minority populations are aware of and taking \nadvantage of all end-of-life care options that are available to them so they are able to make \nthe best decisions they can for themselves. \n \nThe bill has the potential to help ignite that because, as Peg Sandeen said in her opening \nremarks, what we see happen is this legislation opens the door to people finally having a \nconversation that they otherwise avoid.  It might open up because there is a bill hearing; it \nmight open up because they see a media article; it might open up because now they ask their \ndoctor.  That is why we see increased enrollment into hospice care after the legislation is \nimplemented into a state.  A patient goes in and says, \"I want to be in control of my end.\"  It \nopens up the door for that conversation and then you have doctors and patients finally having \na conversation about what kind of end-of-life care options you have.  It ends up improving \nend-of-life care across the board.   \n \nAs an organization, we are very committed to addressing the inequities that exist across all \nend-of-life care.  This bill does work to ensure that no one will be pushed into this as an \noption in its current form. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank you, Assemblyman Flores, for sharing your story.  You should never apologize for \nbeing human and having emotions.  I am honored to hear your story today.  These are \nemotional issues.  As a physician, I have been involved with hundreds of patients at the time \nof their deaths, understanding their fears and concerns.  I have had patients ask me not to let \nthem suffer, saying that they are worried about pain.  That is always my question to them, \n\"What are you afraid of?\"  I was there for them and actively involved, making sure we had \npalliative care and making sure we had hospice care.  That concern about death with dignity \nand making sure they do not suffer—usually I can solve that for them and make sure that \ndoes not happen, but I never actively engaged in ending their life. \n \nI would like to focus on the bill; the rest is all about emotion.  I have some concerns—which \nis one of several reasons why in the past this bill has not been passed.  First and foremost, \nthere was testimony that there was no abuse of this in Oregon; however, in section 1, it is \nforbidden for a coroner to investigate the case.  When someone has a prescription, how \nwould we know if the case was abuse or not when the coroner is forbidden to investigate?  \nHow do we know there is not abuse when you cannot investigate it? \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nKim Callinan: \nThe intention of the language in section 1 is that if the person has chosen this as an option, \nthere is nothing to investigate because you know they are going to take the prescription \nmedication.  If there was some reason or suspicion of foul play, of course the coroner would \nbe able to investigate.  It is not stopping an investigation if there is foul play, but if a person \nhas chosen this as an option and has gone through the process, there is not a reason to \ninvestigate because the investigation is going to show that they have taken a prescription to \nend their suffering. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI disagree with that.  Just because they got the prescription does not mean they are ever going \nto use it.  You have testified that many people apply for this and then do not use it.  Does the \nfact they have applied for the prescription negate any other studies or investigations?  I have \nto disagree with you there. \n \nNext are sections 3 and 25.  I, as a doctor of 36 years, have signed many death certificates.  \nIn that death certificate are categories:  immediate cause of death, associated cause of death, \nup to five lines on underlying causes of death.  In your bill, it mandates that we have to sign \nwhat  the  diagnosis  was  that  allowed  them  to  obtain  this  medication—that  six-month \ndiagnosis.  We all know, and you have to know, that just because a doctor says someone is \ngoing to die within six months—I have had patients die in a week, and I have had patients die \nmany years later.  The diagnosis of six months does not mean that is inevitable.  I believe \nthere is a power greater than me, and to say someone is going to be dead in six months, \nfrequently that does not happen.   \n \nMy concern is by not being able to sign that the person did indeed take an assisted suicide \ndrug.  Say they took it within a day of getting that suicide drug and their diagnosis was \npancreatic cancer.  The average lifespan of someone with pancreatic cancer is six months, but \nnow this person has died in two weeks and not from pancreatic cancer but from taking this \nmedication.  That skews the data on what the average lifespan is for a person with X disease.  \nWe are looking at terminal diseases here.  Not being allowed to say, \"No, they took this \nmedication,\" but with the caveat of having a terminal disease.  By saying they died of \npancreatic cancer, which is absolutely not true—they died from the medication, because \nI would write down as the immediate cause of death, respiratory distress, heart attack.  Why \nis that any different?  The underlying cause would still be pancreatic cancer; it does not take \naway the fact that they had that disease.  But why the push for not giving the truth—the fact \nthat they died from an overdose of medication? \n \nKim Callinan: \nDr. Grube is on the line, and I think he can respond to this one. \n \nDavid Grube, M.D., Private Citizen, Philomath, Oregon: \nI am a retired family physician in Oregon, and I did respond to patient requests regarding aid \nin dying.  I appreciate your question because I have heard this many times and we have had \nmany conversations with other physicians about this.  From my perspective, and possibly the \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nperspective of the bill, there are two reasons for the death certificate.  One is to establish the \nlegal parameters of the estate and the other is the epidemiology of the disease that you talked \nabout.  The latter will be covered by the reporting requirements that you will have in Nevada \nand that we have in Oregon.  That data will be coming to the state for epidemiological \nconcerns.  The death certificate, however, is a public document and discoverable by anybody.  \nWhen Death with Dignity or Medical Aid in Dying—the name of the bill—is on the death \ncertificate, that has implications publicly for the family, for intimacy, for HIPAA [Health \nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act] violations, et cetera.  I think your concerns are \naddressed by the reporting requirements your State of Nevada requires. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI respectfully disagree.  In section 28, I am mandated to refer to another physician.  Is there a \ntimeline in the bill that says how much time I have to make that referral?  Is there going to be \na list published somewhere so that I, as a provider, have a list of other providers who are \nwilling to do this?  How does that work? \n \nKim Callinan: \nThere is not a time frame in the bill.  It is expected that, in the same way you would refer \nsomeone in a timely manner to any other provider, you would do the same with medical aid \nin dying.  It is asking you to follow the normal practice of medicine and refer the patient out.  \nThere is also the option of referring the person for information.  It does not mandate that it \nhas to be to another provider who will practice medical aid in dying.  It could also be to a \ngeneral information source. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nWho pays for the medication?  You get this prescription, you go to the pharmacist, and \nsection 29 mandates that the pharmacist fill it.  What is the average cost and what if they \ncannot pay?  Does the pharmacy have to dispense the medication? \n \nKim Callinan: \nMost of the time the person is paying for the medication themselves, or some of the states \nthat have medical aid in dying have allowed for the medication to be paid for through their \nstate Medicaid program.  Also, private insurance often does cover the medication.  It runs \nabout $550 to $600. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nAnd there is no shortage of supply. \n \nDavid Grube: \nThere is no shortage of supply at the present time.  The prescription is a compounded \nprescription of currently available medications. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nSections  42  and  43  mandate  that  insurance  companies  cannot  deny  someone  insurance \ncoverage even though they have noted that they are going to take this medication.  For me, \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nthe person can get a terminal illness, say, \"I am going to get this medication and then apply \nfor life insurance.\"  From a business standpoint, it seems as though you are putting a huge \nburden on the insurance companies.  How does that work in Oregon?  Can they still issue a \nlife insurance policy, yet the person knows he or she has a terminal illness? \n \nDavid Grube: \nThese people are about to die.  Not one of them would be available for life insurance if they \nrecovered.  In Oregon, 95 percent of them are already enrolled in hospice, so they are \ncovered in that way.  There is no possibility that this group of people would be eligible for \nlife insurance. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nWhy is it in the bill that you cannot refuse life insurance?  Section 43 says that specifically:  \nyou cannot deny under a group policy, cancel a policy, or refuse to issue an insurance policy \nif you apply.  To me, they could apply once they get the diagnosis. \n \nDavid Grube: \nWe do not have that as part of our Death with Dignity Act in Oregon. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nSection 43, subsection 1, paragraph (b), you cannot \"Refuse to sell, provide, or issue . . . life \ninsurance\" to someone who applies for this. \n \nKim Callinan: \nThat was not the intention.  It could have been that something got reworded in bill drafting.  \nThat is certainly something I am sure we can look at with Assemblyman Flores.  If your \nconclusion is correct, we would be supportive of an amendment if he was. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank you all for your presentation.  Thank you, Madam Chair, for your tolerance of my line \nof questioning, but I just felt these questions needed to be asked.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAssemblywoman Titus, if you have additional questions, please ask them.  Do you have \nfurther questions? \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nMadam Chair, I have a bunch more, but I know other folks have questions, so thank you. \n \nAssemblywoman Krasner: \nI would like to say thank you to Assemblyman Flores for sharing his personal story with us.  \nMy question is for Ms. Callinan.  In preparing for this hearing today, I did a lot of reading \nand read several articles on the topic.  I am glad she talked about protecting vulnerable \npopulations.    In  some  articles  I  was  reading  about  the  limitations  on  safeguards  for \nvulnerable populations.  Is there anywhere in the bill where there are safeguards preventing \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \nan insurance company from delaying or denying expensive treatments—for say, cancer—\ncausing the person to suffer, almost pushing or encouraging someone to choose end-of-life \nprescriptions?  This is something I saw on the National Council on Disability, which said that \nwhen assisted suicide is legalized, it immediately becomes the cheapest treatment; \"direct \ncoercion is not necessary.\"  If insurers deny or even simply delay approval of expensive \nlife-sustaining treatment, patients can be steered toward hastening their death.  Could you \ncomment on that? \n \nKim Callinan: \nThe decisions an insurance company makes about whether to provide care have nothing to do \nwith the medical aid-in-dying laws being in a state or not.  Insurance companies look to see \nwhether a treatment meets their criteria and that is what determines whether they do that.  \nThe bill does not allow for an insurance company to deny treatment and then offer medical \naid in dying as an option.  If that was really happening, if that was the way it worked across \nthe states, we would not have 4,300 people utilizing the law across the combined 50 years of \nexperience.  The law requires that the person be the one who is making the request and \nasking for the option.  While I understand that is a concern, the legislation does address that \nconcern. \n \nDavid Grube: \nThat is a concern I have heard before, but it is not a reality.  The experience in Oregon does \nnot show that has ever happened.  This group of people are near death, and have been \nthrough all the kinds of treatment.  It is not as though they are being denied a last treatment.  \nThis is a group of hospice patients for the most part, so that is not something we have ever \nseen happening in Oregon. \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nYou mentioned that 43 people have chosen this.  Was this just in Oregon or is that a total \nnumber? \n \nKim Callinan: \nIt is 43,000 people across all the authorized states that collect data, which is about nine states \nover 50 years. \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nIn section 22, it says that the patient must be able to ingest the medication themself.  Is this in \npill form or a liquid? \n \nDavid Grube: \nThe current protocol is a liquid of about four ounces, or half a glass of water, that is drunk.  \nThe individual will fall asleep in about ten minutes and die very peacefully in less than an \nhour.  It can sometimes come as a powder that the family would mix with a liquid, so it could \nbe a powder or a liquid form, but it is not a pill. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nMy last question concerns section 28, which states that a pharmacy does not have to dispense \nsuch medication.  Has that been a barrier in other states? \n \nDavid Grube: \nI had a woman who went four miles in her electric wheelchair, as she was dying of breast \ncancer, to get a prescription.  I live in a small town, and the pharmacist that day did not \nbelieve in death with dignity and would not dispense the medication that was sitting on the \nshelf.  She went all the way back to her residence and had to return another day, so this is a \nthing that can happen. \n \nKim Callinan: \nDavid Grube is right; this is something that can happen.  The good news is that we have more \npharmacies participating, and with the ability to mail, we have been able to mitigate this as \nan issue, but it is a challenge that we have to work through after the law gets implemented. \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nYou mentioned it can be mailed to a patient as well.   \n \nAssemblyman Flores: \nMadam Chair, could I go back to the question posed by Assemblywoman Titus? \n \nChair Nguyen: \nGo ahead, and I know Karly O'Krent with the LCB [Legislative Counsel Bureau] Legal \nDivision can also assist. \n \nAssemblyman Flores: \nReferring to section 42, page 31, lines 42 through 45, you posed a question as to whether we \nwere somehow tying the hands of an insurance provider by including that section.  I wanted \nto clarify that an insurance company now can still refuse based on someone having a terminal \ndisease or illness.  They can still do that.  What this section is clarifying is that they cannot \nsay they are not going to, based on the fact that the medication has been requested.  We \nwanted to specifically delineate that so we are not sending mixed messages.  The insurance \ncompany, as they do now, would be allowed to refuse based on the fact that someone has a \nterminal illness.  That does not change; this is just specifically denying on the basis of the \nactual request for the medication. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank you for that clarification.  I will follow up offline because I still have some concerns \nabout that provision being in there.  It may be the only thing they know about the patient. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI would encourage Assemblywoman Titus to reach out to Ms. O'Krent.  I know she provided \na similar answer. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \nAssemblyman Hafen: \nI want to thank Assemblyman Flores for bringing this bill forward.  It has made me do some \nsoul-searching and made me do some research in the Bible, because this is a very tough \nconversation for us to be having today.  In some research in the other states that have had the \nassisted suicide path, we have seen a direct correlation with increased suicides.  My concern \nis that with the recent pandemic and lockdown, we have seen a dramatic increase in suicide \nattempts.  Is there an explanation about why we are seeing a direct correlation with states that \nhave passed assisted suicide—specifically Oregon—and the increase in suicide? \n \nDavid Grube: \nI will send you an article that recognizes there is not a correlation between increased suicides \nin Oregon and our Death with Dignity Act.  It is probably based more on the fact that our \npopulation has increased and other situations and stressors.  Suicide in America is a huge \nproblem that we in medicine and in all parts of our society need to address genuinely.  \nHowever, it is not true that there is a direct correlation between the passage of the Death with \nDignity Act in Oregon and suicides in our state.   \n \nPeg Sandeen: \nI echo what Dr. Grube said.  There is not a direct correlation and there is statistical evidence \nthat there is not a direct correlation between suicide and enactment of the Oregon Death with \nDignity Act.  Suicide patterns are different across the United States.  Some states have higher \nlevels; some states have lower levels, but it is not related to the existence of any of the death \nwith dignity acts. \n \nAssemblyman Hafen: \nI would appreciate looking at the data because the data I looked at is showing that Oregon's \nsuicide rate is 41 percent higher than the national average.  If I understand it, the problem is \nnot the assisted suicide but the increase in population; however, I am confused about why an \nincrease in population would be the rationale for a percentage increase.  I could see the \nnumber increase, but not a percentage increase over the national average being caused by \npopulation.  Could you clarify that? \n \nDavid Grube: \nI did not mean that it was an increase in the percentage.  That is not part of the argument that \nshows there is no correlation, and I will send you that study so you can read that.  You are \ncorrect. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nCommittee  members  have  been  inundated  with  emails  in  support  and  in  opposition  to \nA.B. 351.  With reference to high suicide rates in Oregon since 1999, do we have any \nindication what the suicide rates were in Oregon prior to this?  Is it too hard to make a \nspecific correlation between their law and those rates without taking into consideration other \nfactors like COVID-19, other forms of isolation, weather, or any of those things? \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 27 \n \nKim Callinan: \nWhen you look at the studies looking at suicide rates, there is no correlation.  There are so \nmany different factors, as you noted, that could lead to suicide.  The thing that actually shows \nis that the Western states that have laxer gun laws are the ones that have higher suicide rates.  \nThat is where the correlation exists.  If you look at the states that have enacted medical aid-\nin-dying laws that are on the East Coast, there are lower suicide rates there.  There is no \ncorrelation, there is no causation; they are very independent. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI do not see any other questions.  Assemblywoman Titus, would you like me to go back to \nyou for additional questions? \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI have a question about being a Nevada resident.  A lot of people became Nevada residents \nbecause of our divorce laws many years ago, as in other states it took a long time to get \ndivorced.  Numerous places in northern and southern Nevada were established because \npeople could get divorces here.  When you say \"Nevada resident,\" there is no limitation that \nyou have to be here for, say, six months.  What is the definition of a Nevada resident?  Could \nthey be here just a week and be considered a Nevada resident? \n \nKim Callinan: \nThere is no time frame for how long someone has to be within the state.  It is really about \nwhether you have a government ID, voter registration, all the normal ways you would \nestablish  residency.    However,  there  are  two  important  things  to  keep  in  mind.    Your \nbordering states of Oregon and California already have this as an option, so the idea that \nNevada would become a suicide mecca for this is highly unlikely both because you are \nseeing so many other states adopt this as an option.  But in addition to that, people at the end \nof their lives do not have the wherewithal, the means, the physical ability to pick up and \nmove.  People choose this option because they want to be able to die at home surrounded by \ntheir loved ones.  Very few people have the wherewithal and are able to just pick up at the \nend  of  their  lives  after  getting  a  terminal  diagnosis,  be  able  to  reestablish  residency \nsomeplace, and be able to go through the 13-step process in order to access the law.  In the \nhistory of it being authorized in all the states, there are a couple of examples where people \nhave successfully moved to a state in order to access the option, but those are few and far \nbetween. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nIn choosing the age of 18 instead of, say, 21, have you seen an age difference in who requests \nthis medication?   \n \nKim Callinan: \nWhen you look at the data across all the authorized states, generally speaking, you see that \nolder people are accessing the option.   \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 28 \n \nDavid Grube: \nThe  average  age  has  always  been  over  70.    The  exceptions  are  generally  the \nneurodegenerative diseases like ALS [amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any other questions from Committee members?  [There were none.]  I will begin \ntestimony in support. \n \nDavid Parks, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \nI support the passage of A.B. 351 sponsored by Assemblyman Edgar Flores.  For the last \nthree  legislative  sessions,  I  requested  legislation  on  the  issue  of  medical  aid  in  dying.  \nI brought legislation forward as a promise to a dear friend, who at the end of her life pleaded \nwith me to introduce a bill that would mirror Oregon's Death with Dignity Act.  She would \nhave relocated to Oregon to avail herself of this legislation had her health allowed her to \nmake the move.   \n \nDuring the time I pursued this legislation, I have been asked by people from across Nevada, \nfrom many different legislative districts, to pass this legislation.  Some were cancer patients \nwho wanted to have the peace of mind of knowing they could control their final days.  Others \nwanted the assurance that, after exploring all traditional options, a legal, safe, and peaceful \noption would be available to them to control the end of their lives on their own terms.  Please \nsupport A.B. 351. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you, Senator Parks.  It is a pleasure to see you back here in the virtual legislative \nbuilding.  Now I will turn this over to callers on the line in support of A.B. 351.  It is \nnecessary to limit your testimony to two minutes, but again, I would encourage everyone to \nreach out within 48 hours if you have additional written comments you would like to provide \nto the Committee for consideration either in support or opposition of A.B. 351.  I know that \none  of  our  own  Committee  members,  Assemblywoman  Black,  has  received  a  lot  of \nconstituent  outreach  regarding  A.B.  351.    I  would  encourage  those  people  who  have \nparticipated with her outreach to directly reach out to the legislative website to submit that \ndocumentation.   \n \nSusan Fisher, representing Death with Dignity National Center: \nI am speaking today on behalf of a friend, and I thank Assemblyman Flores for picking up \nthe torch on this important issue and for introducing A.B. 351.  During the 2015 Session, \nI was working on Senate Bill 336 of the 78th Session, which was a bill similar to what you \nhave before you today.  In the course of the session, I met a woman who lives right here in \nCarson City who has been suffering with cancer for many years.  Her name is Debbie Black, \nand in the exhibits you will find a guest column recently written by Debbie [Exhibit K] and \nprinted in the Reno Gazette Journal.  She has the best attitude toward life and has an amazing \nsense of humor.  I rarely see her without a smile on her face.  Debbie could not join us today \nbecause she is spending what will probably be her last visit with her three sisters who all live \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 29 \n \nin different states.  Debbie asked that I relate her story and urge you to support A.B. 351 for \nher.  She is not in a hurry to die.   \n \nShe was first diagnosed with breast cancer 29 years ago when her son was just 6 months old.  \nShe fought it then—surgery, radiation, chemotherapy—and she did pretty well for the next \n20 years until she was diagnosed with brain cancer.  That tumor was removed, but she lost \nmost of the use of one side of her body.  Lots more rounds of chemotherapy, years of \nphysical therapy, and she regained both the use of her arm and leg for the most part and, \nmore important, gained more years of hope.  This past August, she had a craniotomy to get to \na new mass in her head.  It was a metastatic brain tumor.  They were not able to remove it.  \nShe could not have visitors due to COVID-19, so she sent me photos of the huge swath of \nbare scalp covered with metal staples and the dent in her skull where the bones had been \nremoved.    It  was  estimated  in  early  September  that  she  had  10  to  12  months  to  live.  \nShe asked me then if we could hurry up and get this bill passed within that time so she \ncould control the end game.  I told her I did not think we could get it done that fast, but we \nwould try.   \n \nHer son and granddaughter live with her in Carson City.  She does not want to leave them, \nbut she will leave this world anyway—one way or the other.  She has considered setting up \nresidency at a friend's home in California where the Death with Dignity Act has been in place \nsince 2016, and she has asked me to be there with her—to help make her laugh right up to the \nend.  She told me just last week that her doctors think there is a new mass in her brain.  They \ndo not know what it is yet, but they think it may be necrosis—dead brain tissue.  Debbie \nBlack does not know if she would actually use this act and the medication to end her life, but \nshe wants this option because her other options have all been taken away, including the \noption of living.  I thank you, and Debbie thanks you for your time and consideration of \nA.B. 351. \n \nTess Opferman, representing Nevada Women's Lobby: \nWe appreciate the emotional testimony that has been presented today.  End-of-life care \ndecisions are difficult for everyone involved—family, children, parents—and these decisions \nare  even  more  difficult  when  someone  is  dealing  with  unbearable  pain  and  suffering.  \nAssembly Bill 351 gives the option for compassionate end-of-life care allowing someone \nwith six or fewer months to live the opportunity to make informed decisions with their family \nand  friends  to  escape  pain  and  suffering.    This  is  about  human  dignity.    The  Nevada \nWomen's Lobby is in full support of this bill, and sincerely thanks Assemblyman Flores for \nhis compassion in dealing with this challenging topic.  We urge the Committee to pass \nA.B. 351, giving Nevadans the option to choose.  \n \nNick Shepack, representing ACLU of Nevada: \nI want to thank Assemblyman Flores for his impassioned and very real testimony.  I feel you.  \nWe recently lost my aunt to pancreatic cancer, and it was one of the most brutal and violent \nand aggressive things I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing.  The fact she lived in a \nstate where she had access to this type of end-of-life medication brought  comfort to her, to \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 30 \n \nmy grandmother, and to my family that she would not have had at that point.  She did not \nchoose to use the medicine, but the option made all the difference. \n \nThe right to individual autonomy protects people's constitutional right to control their bodies \nand to make end-of-life decisions.  There is value in having aid in dying that is legal and \ntransparent.  States with bans have tolerated gray markets where people with resources can \nfind sympathetic doctors to give them medication, but those with limited resources often use \nself-induced means that fail.  When a process is open and transparent, it can be regulated and \nkeep people safe and keep track of the process.  End-of-life choices are already recognized \nand accepted legal practice.  Competent adults' unqualified legal right to decline medical care \nis accepted when clear and convincing evidence exists that the patient wishes to end life \nsupport through advanced directives.   \n \nFinally,  aid-in-dying  laws  open  communications  between  doctors  and  their  patients  to \npromote the right of the person to choose to keep living.  The statistics from the Disability \nRights Project show that 1 in 25 patients who ask a physician about aid in dying actually \nrequest the medication.  Because patients and their physicians can speak openly about end-\nof-life options without fear of criminal liability, those patients are free to discuss their fears \nmore openly and seek alternative options.  For these reasons, we strongly support this bill.  \nWe encourage you to vote yes and, again, we thank you for bringing this bill on behalf of \nanyone who has watched someone struggle through the end of life. \n \nPaul Klein, representing Compassion & Choices: \n[Paul Klein submitted the results of a poll, Exhibit L].  Assemblyman Flores, I truly felt your \npassion, conviction, and values today.  I feel incredibly lucky to have your representation at \nthe Nevada Legislature.  Committee members, we really appreciate your consideration of this \nbill today and the thoughtful questions you asked thus far.  While you continue to evaluate \nthis bill, I want to point your attention to a poll conducted just a few days ago that resulted in \n72 percent of Nevadans supporting this legislation.  That is nearly three in four Nevadans; \nmost notably in this poll from political party affiliation to religious affiliation, to age, race, \ngender, and more, every demographic group supports this legislation.  Therefore, if you are \ncontent with the criteria, if you are content with the safeguards of the bill, but your personal \nview is unsure, please know that the Nevada electorate—your electorate—by a vast majority \nsupports this bill. \n \nFred Voltz, Private Citizen, Carson City, Nevada: \nSeveral of this Committee's members are either lawyers, medical doctors, work in the helping \nprofessions,  or  have  science  training  in  their  backgrounds.    They  are  oriented  toward \nproblem-solving.  Unfortunately, an incurable disease does not have a solution.  Worth \nnoting, most of this Committee's members are of a younger age where they probably have \nnot  personally  experienced  the  horrific  illnesses  family,  friends,  and  colleagues  face, \ntypically in the later years of life.  Just as each one of us holds varying views about religion, \nany single religion's beliefs should not be imposed upon the individual or society at large \nwhen facing an existential decision about a personal illness where there is no hope of \nrecovery. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 31 \n \nMachines, drugs, therapies, and other technology can keep someone alive in the technical \nsense for a considerable amount of time despite the human body being ravaged by disease, \npain, or a hopeless medical condition.  Taken in its totality, this legislation offers multiple \nsafeguards against abuse of its provisions; however, one area needing clarifying language is \nin the life insurance realm of sections 42 and 43, as Assemblywoman Titus brought up.  It is \nconcerning that someone could purchase life insurance that might not require underwriting \njust before taking the death-inducing substance in a last-ditch attempt to financially benefit \ntheir  family,  heirs,  or  charities.    Insurance  companies  would  likely  hike  premium \nrequirements on everyone else insured by the company to recover the prospective losses of \ntoo few premiums and too many benefits paid out. \n \nKathleen Bohall, Private Citizen, Reno, Nevada: \nI am in support of A.B. 351.  The Nevada end-of-life options act is not murder, nor is it \nsuicide.  It is a plan for the eventuality of death, which we all face.  We do not wait until the \nmoment of birth of a child to plan for it.  We spend nine months, sometimes years, preparing \nfor that event.  I am not afraid of death, but I am afraid of the dying process.  I have twin \naunts who lived in California.  One aunt died of congestive heart failure at the age of 90 in \n2017.  Her twin sister was at her side and had to watch her agonizing death.  Three years \nlater, my surviving aunt was dying of the same diagnosis.  She chose to utilize the California \nend-of-life options act.  The relief and joy she experienced once she was authorized to use \nthis option was remarkable.  I shared that relief, all the while dreading her death. \n \nI moved to Nevada in 1962, almost 60 years ago.  Nevada is my home and I want to die in \nNevada.  But I plan to move to a state which allows end-of-life options if and when I am \ndiagnosed with a terminal illness.  I urge all lawmakers to research the process of a death \nfrom congestive heart failure before you deny this alternative.  Every mentally capable adult \nwith  six  months  or  less  to  live  should  have  the  choice  to  request  from  their  doctor  a \nprescription they can take to avoid unbearable suffering and die peacefully.  Please support \nA.B. 351. \n \n[Assemblywoman Peters assumed the Chair.] \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nMay we have the next caller, please. \n \nDar Stone, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \nI live in Assembly District 41.  I appreciate being allowed to come before you to speak in \nfavor of A.B. 351 today.  I have been a physician assistant for 38 years with the last 27 years \nbeing here in southern Nevada.  Before that I was a registered nurse and commissioned \nofficer in the United States Public Health Service.  I have attended the bedside of patients \nand their families at the end of life and it has all too often been fraught with pain, suffering, \nand intense anxiety for the patient and their families.   \n \nMedical aid in dying is not assisted suicide.  It is not out of depression that a terminally ill \npatient may want to end their life.  They simply want the option to die peacefully.  It is not \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 32 \n \nfor everyone, but it is a choice.  For those concerned that this decision may be impulsive \nor coerced, those concerns have not been borne out of the evidence gathered over the last \ntwo decades in states where this has been legalized.  There are strong safeguards in place in \nthis bill to prevent abuse, coercion, and impulsivity.  None of us who work in health care \nquestion a patient's right to informed consent.  It is the backbone of our virtually unanimous \nbelief in patient autonomy—the right to elect or forego a medical intervention.  This logic \nshould extend to the rights of a patient to control the circumstances of their death.  It is \nsimply humane and compassionate when suffering is refractory, when hospice care has done \nall it can do for a person suffering from an irreversible terminal illness, that the patient be \nallowed to ingest a lethal medication to end their suffering if that is what they choose.  I urge \nyou to vote in favor of A.B. 351. \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nAre there more callers in support? \n \nKim Mazeres, Private Citizen, Reno, Nevada: \n[Kim Mazeres submitted written testimony, Exhibit M].  I am speaking today in support of \nA.B. 351.  My husband was cognizant until his very last hours.  He knew he wanted the \noption to decide for himself when enough was enough.  Steve passed away in June of last \nyear after suffering chronic rejection due to a lung transplant; however, he and I had many \nconversations about his wishes and those included potential relocation to Oregon in order for \nhim to control the end of his life.  He suffered from COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease, and we discussed medical aid in dying both before his transplant and after.  My \nhusband and I spent more than 30 wonderful years together, a veteran who late in life became \nan attorney employed by the district attorney's office.  Steve was diagnosed with COPD \nwhen he was in his 50s.  After an exacerbation and a failed surgery, doing nothing or having \na transplant were his only options.  Steve brought up the idea of moving to Oregon so he \ncould utilize their medical aid-in-dying law.  I was mad, mad that we might have to uproot \nourselves to establish residency in a state where we have no family, a place that was not \nhome to either of us. \n \nSteve ultimately opted for the transplant, and he did really well for a year, but something \nkicked off chronic lung rejection.  He opted for treatment of the rejection, but it did not work \nfor him.  Steve's last 24 hours were horrific.  He was in a tremendous amount of pain, and \nI scrambled to get him enrolled in hospice.  As it turned out, assistance from hospice was \nperfect.  Steve passed only five hours after starting on service with them, but what would \nhave happened if it had been a weekend with no hospice intake staff available or had I been \nunable to make that happen for us?  If we had the option of medical aid in dying in Nevada, \nmy  husband  could  have  chosen  whether  he  wanted  to  avail  himself  of  that  option.  \nTerminally ill adults should have [unintelligible] at the end of life.  I urge you to pass \nA.B. 351 to give all Nevadans this choice. \n \n[Assemblywoman Nguyen reassumed the Chair.] \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 33 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI will go to our next caller in support.   \n \nDan Diaz, Private Citizen, Alamo, California: \nI am Brittany Maynard's husband.  Brittany died on November 1, 2014.  She was only \n29 years old.  Brittany experienced a gentle dying process only because of the option of \nmedical aid in dying.  Yes, my wife utilized the very program we are discussing here today.  \nI am testifying in support of A.B. 351.  Brittany was determined to live as long as possible.  \nShe endured an eight-hour brain surgery.  We researched every treatment option that was \navailable.  Unfortunately, the cancer was growing aggressively.  This program allowed her to \ntruly live the time she had left and then experience a gentle death.  Brittany's case received \nsignificant attention because at the time we had to move from our home in California so she \ncould access Oregon's  law.  Had we stayed in California, the brain tumor would have \ncontinued to torture her to death.   \n \nPeople in Nevada deserve better than that.  No one should ever have to leave their home like \nwe did.  With 72 percent of Nevadans agreeing with Brittany that a terminally ill individual \nshould have this option at end of life, I hope this Health and Human Services Committee \nreflects that support from your constituents as you vote in favor of this bill.  Furthermore, as \na Catholic and as a Latino, I take great pride in the fact that 70 percent of Catholics \nnationwide also agree that this option should be available to terminally ill individuals who \nqualify.   \n \nI have spoken with several of you personally.  Please keep in mind that Brittany simply took \ncontrol back from that cancer so she would not have to suffer.  The opponents' campaign is \nbased on fear.  They use inflammatory words like \"suicide\" and \"euthanasia\" in their attempt \nto scare legislators and the public.  To be very clear on this, this very protective option for \nterminally ill individuals does not result in more people dying.  It simply results in fewer \npeople suffering. \n \nClare Johnson, M.D., Private Citizen, Reno, Nevada: \n[Clare Johnson submitted written testimony, Exhibit N].  I am an emergency medicine \nphysician living in Reno.  As an emergency room (ER) doctor, I see patients at the peak of \ntheir suffering, often in the last six months of life.  I have seen patients lose the ability to eat \nas stomach cancer has progressed.  I have seen 6-foot-2-inch men at only 130 pounds at the \nend of months of chemotherapy.  It has become evident to me with great medical advances, \nwe have created great suffering.  I believe it is our moral imperative as a society to give \noptions that alleviate this suffering. \n \nI started my career in a state without medical aid in dying, Georgia, and later worked in a \nstate with medical aid in dying, California.  A coworker in California recently lost a family \nmember after a three-year battle with metastatic cancer.  This family member opted for \nmedical aid in dying at the end of her life.  She had control over the end of her life and was \nable to die in the comfort of her own home with multiple family members present.  She was \none of the 405 terminally ill people in California in 2019 who chose this option.  Many of \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 34 \n \nyou here today may not want to exercise this option or this option may go against your \npersonal belief system.  I respect that and celebrate that we have different views; however, \nwe owe it to our diverse state to provide people with diverse options at the end of life.  \nI strongly support A.B. 351. \n \n[Exhibit O, Exhibit P, Exhibit Q, Exhibit R, Exhibit S, Exhibit T, and Exhibit U in support \nwere submitted but not discussed and will become part of the record.] \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThat was the last caller we had on the line in support of A.B. 351.  We took 23 minutes of \ntestimony in support, and at this time I will take testimony in opposition to A.B. 351.  I have \nsome individuals on Zoom and will start with them.  I will ask you to limit your testimony to \nfour minutes today, please. \n \nBrianna Hammon, Private Citizen, Reno, Nevada: \nI  am  an  international  disability  advocate  born  and  raised  here  in  Nevada  speaking  in \nopposition.  Please note, I have an incurable and irreversible condition that cannot be cured \nor modified by any known current medical therapy or treatment.  In fact, I have several.  \nThey are called disabilities.  Even though the bill cleverly does not say the word \"disability,\" \nthere I am.  All you need is an opinionated doctor to make a subjective pronouncement of my \nimminent death, which many would be very willing to do, and I meet the definition of \nterminally ill.  I am amazingly healthy, but I am at risk here.  All ideas, including assisted \nsuicide, are utopian, full of safeguards and happy, rich white people who are used to having \ncontrol  over  their  health  care.    But  reality  is  chaotically  haphazard  and  even  violent \nespecially for people with disabilities and the elderly who live in poverty and even middle \nincomes.    People  with  disabilities  very  often  do  not  even  receive  suicide  prevention \ncounseling for depression, did you know that?  We show signs of wanting to give up or have \nsuicidal thoughts.  Attitudes and access barriers can make us lonely, but no one tells us about \ncounseling.  They tell us about death.  What kind of message is that?  Disability you are born \nwith; it is just who you are.  I do not want to be you; I want to be me—disability and all.  \nAnd for people who acquire disabilities, we are talking about conscious, sentient human \nbeings who need time to adjust to limitations and overcome obstacles.  Assisted suicide's \npush fails to allow that time.  \n \nI need you to understand that as the only alternative to death that those in power offer to \npeople who require assistance is poverty and segregation in nursing homes, then it makes no \nsense to talk about assisted suicide as a choice because according to the Oregon statistics, the \nnumber one reason that people choose assisted suicide is not wanting to be a burden.  No one \neven tells them about attendant supports and all the other myriad of supports that help us stay \nconnected to communities.  \n \nI think it may be hard for you to imagine what it is like to seek medical services as a person \nwith a disability.  I have a very hard time getting many medical professionals to listen to me.  \nIt is like they have a script in their head about the poor disabled girl and they assume they \nneed to make decisions for me.  I explained to the doctor that I have a significant gag reflex \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 35 \n \nand would need sedation for a procedure, but he kept ignoring me and assuring my mother \nI was not a behavior problem.  Many professionals are as uncomfortable around me as the \ngeneral public because I have the \"Stevie Wonder\" head bob; people prefer to talk to the \npeople I am with who have an easier time making eye contact. \n \nFamily members have so much influence in the medical field and not all of them want what \nyou want.  Well-meaning doctors look at me and think I would be better off dead.  They will \nthink it is a favor to just offer suicide to me.  Over and over again, I will be educated about \nmy right to die.  Do you know what it is like to be told you should suicide?  You should fill \nout paperwork to end treatment?  You should have a DNR [do not resuscitate]?  Everyone \nwants to educate me; no one wants to tell me my life is worth living.  If you pass this bill, \nyou make it law.  You make it worse. \n \nT. Brian Callister, M.D., Private Citizen, Reno, Nevada: \nI appreciate being here.  This is such an emotional, tough subject.  My heart goes out to \nAssemblyman Flores and all of you who have had to experience this.  I am here to let you \nknow  that  there  are  perverse,  negative  consequences  you  need  to  consider  with  this \nlegislation.  It sounds like everything is going swimmingly well in Oregon.  That is not \nexactly genuine or legitimate. \n \nI  got  involved  with  this  a  few  years  ago  when  I  had two  patients—Nevadans—in  our \nhospital.  One was visiting and then going back to Oregon and one was going to California.  \nThey both had serious illnesses that would be terminal without treatment.  Both patients had \na potential for a cure, a significant chance of cure with a standardized medical regimen.  \nI referred one of these patients to Oregon and one to California.  When this came up, in both \ncases the insurance medical director—not in writing but on the phone—said to me, \"Brian, \nwe are not going to cover the treatment or the transfer, but by the way, did you talk about \nassisted suicide?  Did you bring it up?\"  I was stunned; I could not believe it.  Of course, \nwhen I called them out on that, their response was, \"Oh, there is no correlation,\" and you \nheard some of that today.  No correlation.  They deny treatments all the time, they approve \ntreatments all the time, and they just happened to deny a lifesaving, standardized treatment, \nand asked if we had offered this alternative.  That is what got me involved in this.   \n \nIn fact, when you talk about the potential for coercion and abuse, you have to understand that \nas physicians, we are very poor at predicting life expectancy with a terminal diagnosis.  \nIt sounds all so precise:  Oh, I am a doctor, and you have six months to live.  Our average \nerror in the medical literature in predicting how long you have is 50 to 70 percent off.  So, we \nare very good at giving you a diagnosis.  We are very bad at predicting how long you have \nand, most important, how good a quality of time you may have left.  Once you get to the end, \nyes, we need more effort in palliative care, in hospice, and they are working well in other \nstates.  This falls in the category of throwing out the baby with the bath water. \n \nTo  address  Assemblywoman  Thomas's  concern,  especially  with  communities  that  have \nlimited access to health care—that have been marginalized, disenfranchised, people of color, \npeople in poor neighborhoods—how do you know people are not being denied standard \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 36 \n \nmedical treatments because this is now called a \"medical treatment.\"  Killing someone with a \nprescription is called a \"medical treatment\" and it gives the insurance companies the cheapest \noption.  The chance to offer that up instead of a standardized treatment, and it has happened \nto me twice.   \n \nPeople have said in the past, \"There is no proof of that.\"  Let me get rid of that right now.  \nMy senior resident at the time backs this up and you can look at the Washington Free \nBeacon, June 5, 2017, because there is an article corroborating this story.  You get to the fact \nthat there is a suicide contagion.  In answer to the question about suicide rates, in the first \n15 years since the Oregon assisted suicide law was passed, the national rate of suicide went \nup by 23 percent, and that is sad.  The Oregon rate of increase in general suicide was \n48 percent.  Because there is no witness required at the very end, what is to keep granny, who \nis being told by her freeloading grandson and girlfriend, \"Your life isn't worth living,\" to go \nget the prescription and go home.  Who knows if the pill was forced on granny?  They say \nthere is no evidence of abuse, but there is no requirement for investigation. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDr. Callister, you are right at four minutes.  Can I get you to wrap up? \n \nBrian Callister: \nThe real story here is, when does your right to die become some other person's duty to die?  \nThis is not a medical treatment.  This is assisted death.  Let us make that very clear. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nLet us go now to the phone lines and begin testimony in opposition to A.B. 351.   As a \nreminder, if you are not able to testify in support, opposition, or neutral today, you have \n48 hours to submit written comments.           \n \nKathleen Rossi, Private Citizen, Reno, Nevada: \nI am a registered nurse who has worked in Nevada for over 34 years, and I have a lot of \nexperience in end-of-life care.  I am opposed to this legislation because it is rife with flaws \nand it will bring unintended consequences.  The phrase that \"hard cases make bad law\" could \nnever be truer than here.  It will change the standard of care when it makes assisted suicide \nquote, \"medical treatment,\" unquote.  Suicide has never been a medical treatment and one \ncertainly does not need a physician to overdose with pills.  To act like assisted suicide does \nnot change attitudes of physicians toward medical care options is naïve.  I would like to \nquote Wesley Smith, a bioethicist, when he says, \"Advocacy for legalizing assisted suicide is \nalways couched in terms that would limit access to those who are terminally ill.  But given \nthe philosophical and ideological principles that underlie the assisted suicide movement that \nautonomy is paramount and ending life is a valid answer to human suffering, restricting \nassisted suicide to the dying becomes utterly illogical.  After all, many people experience far \ngreater suffering and for a longer period of time than people who are terminally ill.  Thus, \nshould the two seminal premises of assisted suicide become generally accepted by a broad \nswath of medical professions and among the public, there is little chance that this permitted \nsuicide would remain limited to the terminally ill.\" \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 37 \n \nWe do see this in the Netherlands and in the documented cases of suicide contagion.  I see \nthat almost every state that has passed assisted suicide goes on to expand and progress those \nlaws in future years.  As a nurse, I have also noticed that it often is not the patient that cannot \nhandle the terminal suffering, it is the family that does not understand the dying process in \ngeneral.  I also note that many end-of-life dying processes like heavy breathing that occur \nnormally are not evidence of pain but are extremely distressing to family members.  We need \nto do more education about hospice and end of life with family members.  We have gotten so \nmuch better at end-of-life care since I started in nursing. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nYou are right at two minutes.  Can I get you to wrap up and please submit any written \ncomments you might have to supplement your testimony today. \n \nKathleen Rossi: \nThis will change medical options by making this \"medical treatment.\"  Research should be \nput into continuing the improvement we see in hospice care and not in allowing assisted \nsuicide. \n \nMary Fechner, Private Citizen, Reno, Nevada: \n[Mary Fechner supplied additional information, Exhibit V].  I represent myself and I urge \nyou to vote no on A.B. 351.  Physician-assisted suicide is an extremely complex subject.  \nIt demands careful thought and consideration of the many issues at stake.  I am currently \nholding a copy of the proceedings of a two-day workshop hosted by the National Academy \nof Sciences, Engineering and Medicine in Washington, D.C., in 2018.  The workshop entitled \n\"Physician-Assisted Death:  Scanning the Landscape\" included 40 experts in the fields of \npalliative medicine, aging, end of life, bioethics, hospice care, law, veterans affairs, serious \nillness care, theology, epidemiology, medical ethics, health policy, special needs, Medicare, \nMedicaid plans, employee health programs, clinical psychiatry, philosophy, medical doctors \nand  practitioners.    These  experts  presented  their  findings  based  on  their  research  and \nexperience.  They published a 165-page summary of their findings.  Rather than a cursory \nconsideration of public testimony—which I have found there are some inaccuracies and some \nlack  of  basic  general  knowledge  about  how  this  bill  works  in  Oregon,  which  is  very \nconcerning—I urge you to research this very complex issue and its ramifications before \nmaking your decision.  Rather than concentrating your efforts and our tax dollars on ending \nthe lives of our citizens, please direct them toward preserving life and providing loving, \npalliative care at its end.  Nevada citizens will thank you for it. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nYou are at two minutes now; can I get you to wrap it up?  If you have additional comments, \nplease submit those in writing. \n \nMary Fechner: \nI wanted to say that Ms. Callinan has been quoted in 2019 as saying, \"If lawmakers want to \nimprove medical aid-in-dying laws, then let's address the real problem:  There are too many \nregulatory roadblocks.\" \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 38 \n \nJohn Kelly, Director, Second Thoughts Massachusetts: \nI am the director of Second Thoughts Massachusetts, disability rights advocates against \nassisted suicide.  I agree with everything Brianna Hammon said.  Bills like these promote \nprejudice against our lives because we depend on others for our care.  The messages that our \nlives are worthless are endless, and this bill promotes that prejudice.  Assembly Bill 351, like \nall assisted suicide bills, takes away individual choice and gives it to insurers who care more \nabout money than people.  Doctor Callister speaks the truth.  We cannot trust insurers to do \nthe right thing rather than the cheapest thing.   \n \nProponents say there has never been a case of abuse, but that is absolutely false.  Please do a \nsearch for Wendy Melcher, a very ill transwoman who had not applied for assisted suicide.  \nTwo nurses tried to kill her with massive amounts of morphine, and she died a few days later.  \nThere was no criminal referral to authorities, the Oregon Nursing Board dealt with the matter \nin secret, and the nurses received light discipline.  There are many other cases that have been \ndocumented.   \n \nI thank Dr. Titus for bringing up the impossibility of accurate prognoses.  As she said, people \ncan live years longer than six months, like the 12 to 15 percent of people admitted to hospice \nwho outlive their prognoses.  What about those people?  Do we care about them?  Please do a \nsearch for Jeanette Hall who has been alive for 20 years after she sought assisted suicide.  \nShe was persuaded to try more treatment and now she is active against these bills.  Assisted \nsuicide means that people who would otherwise be happily alive are now dead.  Assisted \nsuicide is just too dangerous.  Please vote no.  No matter what they say about safeguards, the \npublic health department has no authority or resources to investigate. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nYou are at two minutes now.  Will you wrap up and please submit your testimony if you \nhave additional comments. \n \nJohn Kelly: \nAssisted suicide says that some people have dignity and some people do not.  It is divisive \nand must be defeated. \n \nFelipe Avila, President, TeenProLifers: \nTeenProLifers is an international youth organization composed of exceptional high school \nand  university  students  working  to  advance  the  pro-life  cause  worldwide.    It  is  truly \nastounding to hear Assemblyman Flores advocate for ending human life in such a casual \nforum.  Assisted suicide gives insurance companies and governments the ability to save \nmoney by pushing lethal drugs that are less expensive than treatment.  No trained medical \npersonnel are required to be present at the time the lethal drugs are taken or at the time of \ndeath, creating the opportunity for an error or abusive caregiver to coerce the patient to take \nthe deadly drugs or put them in the patient's food without the patient's knowledge or consent.  \nThere is no requirement in the bill that the patient, in order to receive lethal drugs, be facing a \nterminal disease that would take their life in six months.  For those in difficult circumstances, \nthe correct responses are encouragement and assistance and not strong arguments in favor of \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 39 \n \ntheir death.  People dealing with depression in the face of illness, injury, or impairment need \nthose around them to affirm their value rather than advocating for a quick end. \n \nPeople targeted for assisted suicide are often people of color like me who often lack the \nresources to pay for medical care.  This discriminatory bill will result in a bigger inequity gap \nbetween income levels in the state, favoring the wealthier who are able to afford such \ntreatment.    As  people  near  the  end  of  their  lives,  realistic,  humane  treatments  and \ncompassionate care are essential.  We can and should explore options such as hospice and \nother measures that help provide comfort to people in their last days.  However, intentionally \nkilling someone can never be compatible with an ethical world view.  Please vote no on \nAssembly Bill 351. \n \nPeter Fenwick, M.D., Private Citizen, Reno, Nevada: \nI am a family practice physician of over 50 years and at present a professor at the University \nof Nevada, Reno medical school seeing patients and teaching students.  I practiced at times in \nfour countries—England, Scotland, and Anguilla, where I was the only physician, and the \nU.S.A.    I  oppose  A.B.  351  for  several  reasons.    I  took  the  Hippocratic  oath,  which \ncategorically states that I will give no deadly medicine to anyone if asked or suggested.  As a \nfamily practitioner, my patients have become my family.  I have treated literally thousands of \npatients and hundreds of patients with terminal illnesses and never needed to subject anyone \nto a form of assisted suicide.  I also have never let anyone suffer, as I have always been able \nto treat any untoward symptoms successfully. \n \nIt is important when a patient is in the terminal stages of life to handle the patient's medical \nand psychological state, and this includes the family.  To introduce assisted suicide as a topic \nwould be harmful to all concerned.  When I worked in emergency rooms in London and \nReno, I saw several people who were brought in having taken overdoses.  Those who were \nnot comatose were suffering severe physical symptoms.  Do we really want to subject people \nto that kind of death when I can treat all their symptoms of illness and they can experience a \nnormal death which also helps the family in that situation?  The very fact that the patient \nmust administer the medication and the physician must basically not be there infers that the \nphysician is not responsible.  This is terrible.  Section 25 states that taking the prescribed \noverdose is not suicide, though the whole procedure is titled \"assisted suicide.\"  If handing a \npatient a handful of pills to kill themselves would be okay, is it okay to hand them a gun \nwhich would cause instant death and not necessarily a slow death?  Sections 1, 2, and 3 state \nthat a physician must not state the true cause of death. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDoctor, you are at two minutes right now, I need you to wrap up your testimony.  If you have \nsome written testimony, please submit it. \n \nPeter Fenwick: \nThe doctor must falsify the death certificate to state the patient's illness is the cause of the \ndeath.  The actual cause of the death is the medical overdose, which must be left off the \ncertificate.  The death certificate should be 100 percent truthful [allotted time was exceeded]. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 40 \n \n[Exhibit W, Exhibit X, and Exhibit Y in opposition were submitted but not discussed and \nwill become part of the record.] \n \nChair Nguyen: \nNow we will go to neutral testimony. \n \nJamie Rodriguez, Government Affairs Manager, Washoe County: \nI am here to testify in neutral.  I want to thank Assemblyman Flores and the proponents for \nagreeing to accept our amendment.  The purpose of our amendment was to create clarity and \nensure the roles of the different participants in the process, wanting to make sure who was \ngoing to be signing the death certificate, treating this much more like hospice so that these \ncases would not come to the coroner or medical examiner and requiring us to do a full \nautopsy and sign off on the death certificate.  \n  \nChair Nguyen: \nIs there anyone else here to testify in neutral?  I will remind callers that this is neutral \ntestimony.  This is not in support; this is not in opposition.  This is neutral testimony on \nA.B. 351.  Again, if you did not have the opportunity, you came on late, or you did not get to \nsubmit your full comments, I would encourage you to submit those comments in writing \nwithin 48 hours of today's hearing on the bill. \n \nMelissa Clement, representing Nevada Right to Life: \nI am just amazed.  We had over two hours of testimony in favor.  There are some very \nserious issues with this bill and there has been insufficient [call terminated]. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThis is not testimony in neutral.  Are there any more callers in neutral?  [There were none.]  \nI will turn this back over to Assemblyman Flores to make any closing remarks regarding \nA.B. 351. \n \nAssemblyman Flores: \nI wanted to thank everyone who called in.  I do not think anyone who called in either in \nsupport or opposition came from a place of wanting to harm Nevadans.  I think everyone \ncame from a very personal and compassionate lens.  I appreciate them engaging in this \nconversation.  I do not take this conversation lightly, and by no means do I think it is easy \nengaging in this conversation.  Quite the contrary, it was a difficult conversation for me to \nengage in.  Through my personal experiences, I find myself here presenting this bill. \n \nI also find it slightly disingenuous that we have so many folk call in in opposition, talking \nabout this being a bill to harm people of color and poor communities.  We consistently \ntokenize people of color and poor communities whenever it is to our advantage, which is \nprecisely why I refuse to engage in that conversation.  It is a political tool that is used \nconsistently—all of a sudden, we are utilizing this medication to kill all people of color and \npoor people—when we do not necessarily have the data to suggest that even people of color \nare the ones who are engaging in this option to begin with.  It is frustrating to me because it \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 41 \n \nis often a political ploy that is utilized and often they see me, they see a person of color, and \ndrop these key phrases in hope that they will trigger something not supported by data.  \n \nI come before you and engage in a very personal, very complex conversation.  A whole host \nof other states are now engaging in that, which we can use and study and continue to \nevolve and grow in this subject matter.  I will ask if our copresenters have any additional \ncomments, and I will also say thank you to Senator Parks for his advocacy and work in this \narea.  As I mentioned previously, I am picking up the work he has done in the past for us and \nI am appreciative to him. \n \nKim Callinan: \nThank you so much.  For the record, I wanted to be sure that I had correctly noted the \nnumber of people who had ingested medication.  It is fewer than 4,300 people across nine \njurisdictions in about 50 years who have ingested the medication.  Someone suggested that \nI may have added a zero to the end of that number, and if I did, I wanted to be sure I got that \nright.  That brings such profound peace of mind to those people who choose the option.   \n \nI also want to note that the law specifically notes that people with disabilities do not qualify.  \nSomeone cannot qualify simply because they are disabled; they must be terminally ill with a \nprognosis of six months or less to live.  I know how difficult it is.  We have so many \nsystemic issues within our health care system targeting people with disabilities.  This law \nprovides a structure and framework to ensure that they are protected and has far more \nsafeguards in place than any other end-of-life care option out there.   \n \nI also want to note that it is illegal for an insurance company to deny health insurance.  None \nof us would want health care to be denied by this becoming an option.  If that were to \nhappen, that is the kind of court case that Compassion & Choices will take on and litigate \nbecause we want people to be able to have this option, but we also want them to be able to \nhave good medical care.  It is important that both things can exist at the same time. \n \nI also want to note that I attended and spoke at the National Academy of Sciences' two-day \nconference.  I walked away from that conference hearing very clearly that the doctors who \nprescribed and were practicing medical aid in dying—they had a lot of people who came in \nfrom  California—were  experiencing  that  the  law  as  written  had  too  many  regulatory \nroadblocks in place.  What we have seen in the states that have authorized is no expansion of \nthe law.  It is not that different people are now eligible for the law, but you are seeing \nlawmakers begin to grapple with the fact that you have about a third of people who die \nduring the 15-day waiting period, which is something your bill does address.  That is what \nthe outcome from that conference is and that is what the statement that the person read that I \nmade was—that we needed to find that appropriate balance.  But there has been no expansion \nof medical aid-in-dying laws to different populations.  They are all designed with that same \nsix-month prognosis that is tied to hospice care.  Thank you for taking the time to consider \nthis bill, and if any of the opposition concerns are things you remain concerned about, I am \nhappy to answer questions offline. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 7, 2021 \nPage 42 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAssemblyman Flores, do you have any other comments? \n \nAssemblyman Flores: \nAgain, thank you to everyone who engaged in this dialogue and thank you to all the folk who \nhelped me work on this. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAt this time, I will close the hearing on A.B. 351 and open up for public comment.  I will \nremind everyone that public comment is not a place to rehash the bill we just heard.  If you \nhave concerns in support, opposition, or neutral on A.B. 351, I strongly encourage you to \nreach out to the bill sponsor and send emails to the Health and Human Services Committee \nmembers as well as to your own Assembly representatives.  You can also submit those \ncomments in writing, and they will become a part of the public record if you do so within \n48 hours.  With that, we will begin public comment.

Committee rules and protocol were reviewed.]  Today, we have a work \nsession. \n \nAssembly  Bill  345:    Revises  provisions  relating  to  substance  use  disorders. \n(BDR 40-978) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \nAssembly Bill 345 was heard on March 26, 2021 [Exhibit C].  It authorizes the establishment \nof  a  program  for  the  prevention  of  overdoses  and  disease  by  a  board  of  county \ncommissioners  of  a  county  whose  population  is  100,000  or  more  (currently  Clark  and \nWashoe Counties).  The bill authorizes the State Board of Health to allow the board of \ncounty commissioners of a county whose population is less than 100,000 (currently all \ncounties other than Clark and Washoe Counties) to authorize the establishment of a program \nfor the prevention of overdoses and diseases.  Assembly Bill 345 prohibits certain health care \npractitioners from prescribing an opioid to a patient who is also being prescribed or has been \nrecently  prescribed  a  benzodiazepine  or  has  a  history  of  opioid  use  disorder  or  opioid \noverdose, unless the prescription is medically necessary.   \n \nI  will  go  to  the  amendment  section.    Dr.  Stephanie  Woodard,  Division  of  Public  and \nBehavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services, proposes the following \namendments:   \n \n1.  Delete all the existing provisions of A.B. 345.  \n \n2.  Provide  instead  that  the  term  \"drug  paraphernalia,\"  set  forth  in  Nevada  Revised \nStatutes 453.554, does not include any type of fentanyl strip.  The amendment would \nalso  make  conforming  changes  to  ensure  that  a  person  who  delivers,  sells,  or \npossesses a fentanyl strip is not guilty of any crime. \n \nSee also the conceptual amendment attached to the work session document [pages 3 and 4, \nExhibit C].  \n \nI would like to emphasize that the amendment completely replaces the provisions of the \nintroduced version of the bill.  None of the bill as introduced will appear in the amended \nversion.  To my knowledge, Dr. Woodard is present and can answer any questions members \nmay have.   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 9, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDr. Woodard, there is reference in the work session document to \"fentanyl strips.\"  Would \nyou describe what that means? \n \nStephanie Woodard, Psy.D., Senior Advisor on Behavioral Health, Division of Public \nand Behavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services: \nTo clarify language, we are talking about fentanyl test strips.  Fentanyl test strips have been \nestablished to assist individuals in the community, including law enforcement, to be able to \ndetect if a specific substance contains fentanyl.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI do not know if it needs clarification in the proposed amendment.  Are there any other \nquestions  from  Committee  members?    [There were  none.]    It  looks  like  that  has  been \nclarified.  I will entertain a motion to amend and do pass Assembly Bill 345 to include both \nthe amendment and the language to include a \"fentanyl testing strip.\" \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  PETERS  MOVED  TO  AMEND  AND  DO  PASS \nASSEMBLY BILL 345. \n \nASSEMBLYMAN HAFEN SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any comments on the bill?  [There were none.]  \n \nTHE MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \nI will assign the floor statement to Assemblyman Orentlicher.  Thank you for working on that \nwith the Department of Health and Human Services.  I will move to the next bill on work \nsession, Assembly Bill 347.   \n \nAssembly Bill 347:  Revises provisions related to health care. (BDR 38-541) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \nAssembly Bill 347 was heard on April 2, 2021 [Exhibit D].  Assembly Bill 347 increases the \nMedicaid reimbursement rates through the imposition of assessments on certain groups of \nhealth  care  providers  upon  the  affirmative  vote  of  at  least  67  percent  of  the  affected \nproviders.  It establishes procedures for fixing the rates charged by certain health care \nproviders for services that are reimbursable through Medicare when provided to a patient \nwho is not indigent and is not covered by Medicare or Medicaid, and generally prohibits such \na health care provider from charging different rates.  I will also go straight to the amendment \nsection of the document.  Assemblyman Orentlicher proposes the following amendments: \n \n1.  Delete all the existing provisions of A.B. 347.   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 9, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \n2.  Replace the deleted provisions of the bill with the attached conceptual amendment \n[page 2, Exhibit D].   \n \nI will review the conceptual amendment now.  The first amendment would require that \nduring the 2021-2022 Interim, the Legislative Committee on Health Care shall study and \nexamine:  \n \n•  The economics of setting reimbursement rates for health care services in Nevada by \nprivate and public health insurance providers, including Medicaid, and a comparison \nof this system with those in other states.  \n \n•  The impact of the current reimbursement rates for health care services for patients in \nNevada, including, without limitation, the costs of health care-related services and \nhealth insurance rates. \n \n•  Opportunities and options to fix rates at a certain level which would allow health care \nproviders to cover reasonable costs, earn a fair and reasonable profit, and reduce \nadministrative costs related to health care billing for all stakeholders. \n \n•  Incentives  for  health  care  providers  to  provide  services  to  Medicaid  patients \nthroughout  the  state,  including,  without  limitation,  by  increasing  Medicaid \nreimbursement  rates  through  the  imposition  of  assessments  on  certain  groups  of \nhealth care providers, and through the reduction of administrative burdens.   \n \nThe  Legislative  Committee  on  Health  Care  shall  submit  its  findings  and  any \nrecommendations for legislation to the 82nd Session of the Nevada Legislature.   \n \nThis conceptual amendment will replace all the provisions of the introduced version of the \nbill.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any questions regarding the bill and the proposed amendment?  [There were \nnone.]  I will entertain a motion to amend and do pass at this time. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  PETERS  MOVED  TO  AMEND  AND  DO  PASS \nASSEMBLY BILL 347.  \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN TITUS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nDo we have any comments on the motion?  [There were none.]  \n \nTHE MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 9, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nI will assign that floor statement to Assemblyman Orentlicher.  Thank you for your hard \nwork on such difficult policy topics.  I look forward to the continued conversation in the \ninterim on those topics.  At this time, we will move to Assembly Bill 351.   \n \nAssembly Bill 351:  Establishes provisions governing the prescribing, dispensing and \nadministering of medication designed to end the life of a patient. (BDR 40-882) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \nAssembly Bill 351 was heard on April 7, 2021 [Exhibit E].  It authorizes a patient, under \ncertain circumstances, to self-administer a medication that is designed to end the life of the \npatient and authorizes a physician to prescribe such a medication if the patient meets certain \ncriteria.  The bill outlines certain requirements concerning the manner in which a patient may \nrequest, and a physician may prescribe and dispense, a medication designed to end the life of \nthe patient.  Among other things, the bill requires an attending physician who prescribes such \na controlled substance to include certain information in the patient's medical record and must \nprovide  certain  information  to  the  Division  of  Public  and  Behavioral  Health  of  the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services.  The bill requires the Division to annually review \nthese reports and compile a report that includes certain data concerning the implementation \nof the provisions of this bill.   \n \nAssembly Bill 351 also exempts certain health care providers from professional discipline, \nprovides immunity from civil and criminal liability, and clarifies that they do not violate any \napplicable standard of care for taking certain actions associated with assisting a patient with \nacquiring a medication designed to end his or her life.  The bill provides that a physician is \nnot required to prescribe, and a pharmacist is not required to fill, a prescription for such \nmedication.  The bill also provides that the owner or operator of a health care facility may \nprohibit an employee, independent contractor, or other person who provides services relating \nto prescribing such a medication from providing these services while on the premises of the \nfacility.   \n \nFurthermore, A.B. 351 provides that a death resulting from the self-administration of a \nmedication designed to end the life of a patient does not constitute suicide or homicide when \ndone in accordance with the bill, and a patient's death certificate must list his or her terminal \ncondition as the cause of death.   \n \nFinally, the bill prohibits insurers from:  (1) refusing to sell, provide, or issue a policy of life \ninsurance or annuity contract or from charging a higher rate because a person makes or \nrevokes a request for a medication designed to end the life of the person or self-administers \nsuch a medication; and (2) conditioning life insurance benefits or the payment of claims \nbased on any of these actions. \n \nThis is the end of the summary of this bill.   \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 9, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any questions about the bill or the amendment?  [There were none.]  Do I have a \nmotion to refer without recommendation? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  PETERS  MADE  A  MOTION  TO  REFER \nASSEMBLY BILL 351 WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  BENITEZ-THOMPSON  SECONDED  THE \nMOTION. \n \nThe motion on the floor is to recommend this bill out of Committee without recommendation \nto the full floor of the Assembly for a vote on the policy.  Is there any discussion on the \nmotion?   \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nWill the vote be on whether to move the bill out of Committee without a vote?  Are we not \nvoting on the bill itself? \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe are not voting on the bill itself.  We are voting to move this bill to the Assembly floor \nwithout  recommendation  from  this  Committee.    Is  there  any  further  discussion  on  the \nmotion? \n \nTHE  MOTION  PASSED.    (ASSEMBLYMEN  BLACK,  HAFEN, \nKRASNER, MATTHEWS, AND TITUS VOTED NO.) \n \nWe will finish up our work session agenda.  I do not anticipate we will have anything further \nto do as a Committee, but I will have the Committee stand in recess until the call of the \nChair.  I would encourage everyone to check your emails.  If we are able to adjourn and do \nnot have to come back for additional Committee business, I will have Committee staff notify \nthat we are being adjourned.  At this time, we will stand in recess [at 3:27 p.m.]. \n \n[The meeting resumed at 4:10 p.m.] \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI realized that, at the conclusion of our work session, I did not go to public comment.  I was \ntold there was no one on the line but did not put that on the record.  Out of an abundance of \ncaution I will ask if there is public comment.  I remind public commenters to please limit  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 9, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nyour comments to two minutes.  Is there anyone on the line for public comment?  [There was \nno one.]  We will not be meeting on Monday [April 12, 2021] and likely will not meet next \nweek.  Please pay attention to your emails to see if that changes.  We will stand in recess [at \n4:11 p.m.]. \n \nThe meeting is adjourned [at 5:22 p.m.]. \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nJoan Waldock \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nAssemblywoman Rochelle T.

Committee rules and protocol were explained.]  Now I will open the \nhearing on Senate Bill 364. \n \nSenate Bill 364:  Revises provisions relating to emergency medical care for a victim of \nsexual assault or attempted sexual assault.  (BDR 40-1004) \n \nSenator Melanie Scheible, Senate District No. 9: \nThroughout the nation, many emergency medical care facilities do not offer victims of sexual \nassault the treatment necessary to prevent pregnancy, and some fail to inform the victim that \nit is an option even though the emergency contraceptives are readily available.  Emergency \ncontraception can prevent pregnancy if taken shortly after unprotected sex or sexual assault.  \nOf the four United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved products on the \nmarket, three are approved to prevent pregnancy if taken within 72 hours, and one has been \navailable over the counter since 2013. \n \nMedical facilities' failure to offer or provide emergency contraception means victims of \nsexual assault are at risk of becoming pregnant through no fault of their own.  Senate Bill 364 \naims to ensure that victims of sexual assault here in Nevada are informed about and have \naccess to this necessary treatment.  It requires the State Board of Health to adopt regulations \nrequiring hospitals and independent centers for emergency medical care to provide training to \nindividuals who provide care to victims of sexual assault and attempted sexual assault.  In \naddition, hospitals and independent emergency medical centers that treat victims of sexual \nassault  or  attempted  sexual  assault  must  inform  those  victims  of  their  right  to  receive \nemergency contraceptive and provide all doses of such contraception upon request.   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 21, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nAt least 19 states and the District of Columbia have similar laws, and the American College \nof Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Public Health Association recommend \nthat victims of sexual assault be informed about and offered emergency contraceptive.  \n \nI am happy to report that all the hospitals in Nevada that I talked to are supportive of this bill \nand are already engaging in this practice.  The reason to bring the bill forward is not to point \nfingers at bad actors or to suggest that there are Nevada hospitals or medical providers who \nare not adequately caring for victims or survivors of sexual assault, but we know sexual \nassault is an incredibly personal and sensitive subject, and there are women in Nevada who \nreport not having access to emergency contraceptives at the time of their assault.  Whether \nthat is because they did not go to a Nevada hospital or because they went to a Nevada \nhospital five or ten years ago before the policies changed, I just do not see any reason why \nwe should not be putting into law this kind of provision that is supported by the hospital \nassociations and all the medical providers who I spoke with, to ensure that today, and every \nday in the future, anyone who reports to a Nevada facility—be it a hospital, emergency room, \nor  other  place  where  emergency  care  is  provided—be  offered  and  provided  with  the \nemergency contraception that they need and are entitled to receive if that person is the victim \nof a sexual assault.  I am happy to answer any questions you might have about S.B. 364, and \nI urge your support. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any questions from Committee members? \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank you, Senator Scheible, for bringing this bill forward and championing it on both sides.  \nI have a question regarding your statement that this requirement affects all facilities that offer \nemergency medical care.  Having had a clinic 30 miles from any other medical care, I did not \nhave an emergency room.  I did not advertise it as an emergency room, it was simply a \nfamily practice office; however, occasionally we would have a walk-in emergency or an \nemergency would be carried in to my office.  I would like a clarification:  Would this affect \nevery private office that someone might walk into with an emergency, or does it have to have \nthat designation of being a freestanding urgent care?  Are you talking about urgent care \ncenters and emergency centers, or are you talking about anyone who might see someone on \nan emergency basis? \n \nSenator Scheible: \nBy law, this would be limited to just emergency care providers.  As I conversed with the \nLegislative  Counsel  Bureau's  Legal  Division,  any  place  where  a  sexual  assault  nurse \nexaminer (SANE) exam might be conducted is the kind of place that provides emergency \ncare to someone who is a victim of sexual assault.  Sometimes we see that the problem \nderives from someone going first to an emergency room and then transferring to a different \ncenter for a sexual assault exam.  I also think it is important to point out that the hope here is \nthat medical providers would all want to be doing this and to be providing people with that \nkind of care.  It applies specifically to emergency rooms and emergency care centers. \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 21, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any other questions from Committee members?   \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nThank you, Senator, for bringing this bill forward.  I think it really is necessary.  I was a \nvolunteer advocate at a rape crisis center.  We have a rape hotline, and generally we are told \nto send victims to University Medical Center (UMC).  I thought it was a standard practice \nwhen they went through UMC to be able to offer this.  Could you explain that and how this \nbill would ensure that those victims could be helped if they are not sent to UMC but to other \nemergency rooms? \n \nSenator Scheible: \nYou are correct.  This is UMC's standard practice and also standard practice throughout the \nLas Vegas Valley and in other parts of Nevada.  The purpose of putting this into law is to \nmake that uniform across the state now and into the future.  One of the ways we might see \nthis law affecting people in real life is that people on the crisis call hotline would now be able \nto tell victims that whatever hospital you go to, you are entitled to receive an emergency \ncontraceptive, so if it is not offered to you, ask.  If they do not offer it to you, they are in \nviolation of the law.  You have the right to ask for it and are able to point to the statutes.  \nEvery person who wants and needs emergency contraception has the power of the law to \nrequest it and be entitled to it. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAs clarification for Assemblywoman Titus, the terms \"hospital\" and \"independent center for \nemergency medical care\" are specifically defined in Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 449.  \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nAt the top of the bill it says that there could be a fiscal note.  Could you please explain to us \nwhat that might be?  How would these facilities be reimbursed?  Would that be through \nMedicaid or Medicare? \n \nSenator Scheible: \nI am happy to report that the fiscal note is zero across the board.  I think it was completely \nappropriate that when the bill was drafted it was flagged for a possible fiscal note if this was \nsomething our state-run hospitals were not already doing or something Medicaid was not \nalready covering.  It would have the effect of causing an increased cost to the state; however, \nsince all the facilities in Nevada are already up to par with this policy, there is no additional \ncost involved in ensuring it is uniform across the state. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nYou mentioned public facilities.  We have private hospitals, so could you elaborate about \nhow this would affect them?  Are they on board?  Are they expecting this to change their \nbottom line at all?  It requires SANE.   \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 21, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nSenator Scheible: \nYes, this would also affect private hospitals.  They would also have to provide survivors of \nsexual assault with the choice to get emergency contraception and then that emergency \ncontraceptive if so requested.  All the hospitals I talked to are on board—the Dignity Health \nfamily of hospitals—St. Rose Dominican—Southern Hills—are all on board.  I have not \nreceived any opposition; although if there is, I am happy to talk to those people and work \nthrough this with them.  One hospital reached out to me saying, \"Oh, no.  I hope this was not \nour facility.  Was this us?\"  They all want to comply with this standard, and I think they \nalready do. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any other questions?  Seeing none, is there anyone to testify in support of \nS.B. 364? \n \nTess Opferman, representing Nevada Women's Lobby: \nThis is an incredibly important bill which makes it easier and more accessible for victims of \nsexual  assault  to  access  emergency  contraception.    Emergency  contraception  is  not  an \nabortion; emergency contraception prevents a pregnancy from taking place and is most \neffective when taken within 24 hours of the unplanned sexual encounter.  Victims of sexual \nassault have faced an intense trauma, and there are a number of things they must do after the \nencounter, which could include the filing of police reports, taking drugs to prevent STDs \n[sexually transmitted diseases], and taking emergency contraception or Plan B to prevent \npregnancy.  The Nevada Women's Lobby supports any measure that can be taken to help \nmake this process easier.  Senate Bill 364 requires hospitals and emergency medical centers \nto  have  emergency  contraception  available  so  women  dealing  with  an  assault  can  get \nnecessary medicine quickly and easily without needing to go to a second location.  This is an \nimportant measure that will help alleviate, ever so slightly, an awful situation.  Thank you so \nmuch, Senator Scheible, for your work on this legislation.  We thank you for your time on \nthis bill, and we urge your support today. \n \nCaroline  Mello  Roberson,  State  Director,  NARAL  Pro-Choice  Nevada;  Southwest \nRegional Director, NARAL Pro-Choice America: \n[Caroline Mello Roberson submitted written testimony in support, Exhibit C.]  I am proud to \ntestify in support of S.B. 364, Senator Scheible's legislation to require Nevada emergency \nrooms to make emergency contraception available to survivors of sexual assault.  NARAL is \na  nonprofit  advocacy  organization  dedicated  to  advancing  reproductive  freedom  for \neverybody through policy, political and community organizing.  NARAL organizes across \nthe state through things like virtual meetups, phone banks, online actions, and community \nevents.  We have more than 44,000 battle-born, feminist-strong members and we are growing \nevery day. \n \nSenate  Bill  364  is  a  continuation  of  the  successful  2019  effort  led  by  former-\nAssemblywoman  Connie  Munk  to  require  Nevada  hospitals  to  provide  survivors  with \ninformation on where they can access emergency contraception.  Emergency contraception is \na safe and effective way to prevent pregnancy.  It does not end a pregnancy.  There are a few  \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 21, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \ntypes of FDA-approved emergency contraceptives, including the copper IUD [intrauterine  \ndevice]  and  two  types  of  pills  that  are  commonly  referred  to  as  \"morning  after\"  pills.  \nDepending on the pill, it can be effective if taken within three to five days of unprotected sex.  \nEmergency rooms often serve as an entry point into the health care system for people who \nhave been sexually assaulted.  It is essential that emergency rooms provide access to time-\nsensitive emergency contraception for survivors of sexual assault.  Survivors should not need \nto delay their care while they seek this care from other providers.  There are many who may \nnot be able to see their primary care doctor for the care they need, and timing is really \nimportant. \n \nAccording to mergerwatch.org, an estimated 25,000 women in the United States become \npregnant as a result of sexual assault each year, and statistics suggest that 22,000 of those \npregnancies could have been prevented if the sexual assault victim had had timely access to \nemergency contraception.  Women must be able to decide for themselves if, when, how, and \nwith whom to have a child, which is why NARAL is advocating this session to ensure \nsurvivors are able to access this time-sensitive care as soon as possible. \n \nSenate Bill 364 is a critical step toward breaking barriers down and ensuring we can all live \nin a freer Nevada that works for everybody.  Nevadans are proud to live in a state with a long \nhistory of trusting women to make their own personal health care decisions.  With this bill, \nthe Silver State can continue to live out our values.  We urge the members of this Committee \nto vote in favor of S.B. 364. \n \nSerena Evans, Public Policy Specialist, Nevada Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual \nViolence: \nDuring the 2019 Legislative Session, the Nevada Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual \nViolence worked with Assemblywoman Connie Munk on her legislation which, among other \nthings, established the provisions that are in this bill.  Unfortunately, the piece around \nemergency contraception was eventually amended out of the bill, so we are grateful for \nCaroline Roberson with NARAL Pro-Choice Nevada and Senator Scheible for bringing this \nimportant matter back this session. \n \nThis is the context of why this bill is so important.  I want to share some information with \nyou.  Outside of my capacity at the Coalition, I also volunteer as a sexual assault advocate \nhere in Washoe County.  The Washoe County SANE medical facility is not at the hospital \nand is in a different location altogether.  This facility conducts SANE exams for all of \nWashoe County and many of the northern Nevada rural communities.  For a majority of the \nvictim survivors I see and work with, their first response after being sexually assaulted is to \ngo straight to the emergency room to seek medical care.  They do not want to report to law \nenforcement.  What they want most is care and emergency contraception.  Choosing to \nundergo  the  SANE  exam,  engagement  with  law  enforcement,  and  receiving  emergency \ncontraception are, and should be, separate decisions.  It is so important that victim survivors \nare treated with compassion and given access to emergency contraception, whether or not \nthey  choose  to  submit  themselves  to  a  SANE  exam  or  engage  with  law  enforcement.  \nEspecially for our rural communities, having to travel hours to a SANE location when all \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 21, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nthey really wanted was emergency contraception is not a victim-centered approach.  All \nhospitals should have emergency contraception on hand and should dispense the medication \nwhen requested by the victim survivors.  This bill is a great step in reducing the barriers that \nmany victim survivors face throughout Nevada. \n      \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any other callers on the line in support?  [There were none.]  Do we have any \ncallers in opposition on the line?  [There were none.]  Do we have any callers in neutral?  \n[There were none.]  With that, I will turn this back over to Senator Scheible for any closing \nremarks. \n \nSenator Scheible: \nI want to thank the Committee for your time.  If you have any further questions, please do not \nhesitate to contact me. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 364 and open the hearing on Senate Bill 123 (1st Reprint). \n \nSenate Bill 123 (1st Reprint):  Revises provisions relating to the Nevada Silver Haired \nLegislative Forum.  (BDR 38-6) \n \nSenator Pat Spearman, Senate District No. 1: \nThis is a really simple bill which came about a couple of years ago when I appointed a very \nprominent member of our community and in my district to the Silver Haired Legislative \nForum.  At that time, I was told she was ineligible because she had not lived in Nevada for \nfive years.  This was someone who had retired from a major corporation and had a lot of \ninsight into some of the things I know we are trying to do for seniors.  That is why I brought \nthis bill forward. \n \nThe 1997 Legislature created the Nevada Silver Haired Legislative Forum to identify and act \nupon issues of importance to aging persons.  Its membership, hours, and duties are codified \nin Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 427A.320 through 427A.400.  The Forum is composed of \nmembers equal to the number of State Senators—21—who, among other qualifications, must \nhave been a registered voter for three years preceding their appointment in the senatorial \ndistrict of the Senator who nominates them for an appointment.  In addition, members must \nhave been a resident of the state of Nevada for five years.  Members of the national Silver \nHaired Congress from Nevada serve as ex officio members of the Forum.  Nevada currently \nhas two Silver Senators and three Silver Representatives. \n \nSection 1 of the bill revises the qualifications for appointment to the Forum by reducing the \nrequirement for state residency from five years to one year, or six months if the nominee is a \nmember of the military, and reducing the requirement for residency in the senatorial district \nfrom three years to 30 days.  Section 2 revises qualifications for a member of the Congress \nwho is an ex officio member of the Forum to vote by reducing the requirement for residency \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 21, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nin this state from five years to one year, or six months if the ex officio member is a member \nof the military. \n \nThe changes proposed in this measure will expand the number of individuals who may be \nnominated  by  an  appointing  Senator  to  serve  on  the  Forum.    It  will  also  give  greater \nflexibility to appoint individuals who may be members of the military.  Finally, the measure \nwill expand participation by members of the Silver Haired Congress. \n \nThe five-year requirement for someone who is going to serve with no pay—basically a \nvolunteer—to help us try and solve some of the issues facing our seasoned citizens did not \nmake sense to me.  When we limit the qualifications people must have—five years or ten \nyears—well, we have things that need to be solved this year.  We have things that need to be \nsolved in the next six months.  This bill affords an opportunity for those who are otherwise \nqualified to serve to be appointed to the Nevada Silver Haired Legislative Forum. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any questions? \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nActually, this is a comment.  Senator Spearman, thank you for bringing this forward.  I have \nbeen in a position to appoint people to different boards, and it is almost impossible to find \npeople willing to serve.  When you have someone who is qualified and wants to do the job, \nthat five-year restriction does not make sense, so thank you for bringing some commonsense \nlegislation forward. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any other questions from Committee members?  Seeing none, we will go to \ntestimony in support.  [There was none.]  Do we have any callers in opposition to S.B. 123 \n(R1)?  [There were none.]  Neutral?  [There were none.]  Senator Spearman, do you have any \nclosing remarks? \n \nSenator Spearman: \nThis is commonsense legislation.  When we have people who want to serve, it is ridiculous \nthat they have to expand the number of years they have lived here.  As a matter of fact, \nI think one of the greatest strengths of our state is the fact that you have people who are \ncoming in from other places who can give us a fresh eye about how to solve some of our \nproblems.  It is commonsense legislation, and I hope you all will support this. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWith that, I will close the hearing on S.B. 123 (R1).  At this time, I will open the hearing on \nSenate Bill 398.     \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 21, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nSenate Bill 398:  Revises provisions relating to the Legislative Committee on Child \nWelfare and Juvenile Justice. (BDR S-507) \n \nSenator James Ohrenschall, Senate District No. 21: \nSenate Bill 398 comes out of the work of the last Interim Legislative Committee on Child \nWelfare and Juvenile Justice [Exhibit D].  I had the distinct honor of chairing the interim \ncommittee, ably assisted by Assemblywoman Monroe-Moreno who was vice chair, with a \ntremendous  Legislative  Counsel  Bureau  staff  helping  us,  including  Patrick  Guinan  and \nJulianne King from the Research Division and Eileen O'Grady and Karly O'Krent from the \nLegal Division.  We were able to have two in-person meetings before the pandemic hit and \nfour additional virtual meetings and come up with recommendations.  One recommendation \nwas  Senate  Bill  398.    Senate  Bill  398  recognizes  how  closely  the  interim  Legislative \nCommittee on Child Welfare and Juvenile Justice needs to work with the statewide Juvenile \nJustice  Oversight  Commission  (JJOC).    The  statewide  Juvenile  Justice  Oversight \nCommission was formed out of Assembly Bill 472 of the 79th Legislative Session.  This was \nlegislation during the 2017 Session, spearheaded by former first lady Kathleen Sandoval and \nformer  Justice  of  the  Nevada  Supreme  Court  Nancy  Saitta,  to  try  to  unify  efforts  at \nimproving the juvenile justice system in Nevada.  \n \nThere are a lot of parallels in the work we can do together in terms of trying to help each \nother and work on legislation to reduce the number of children who end up in the juvenile \njustice system.  We want to try and make sure that if children end up in the juvenile justice \nsystem, they get the treatment and help they need and try to prevent them from getting back \ninto the juvenile justice system or ending up in the adult court system. \n \nAdministrator  Ross  Armstrong  was  a  tremendous  help  during  the  interim  in  terms  of \ninformation he gave the Committee and trying to answer all our questions.  I know he cares \npassionately about the same goals of helping children either not get into the juvenile justice \nsystem or trying to get treatment and therapy that will help them get out and not come back.   \n \nSenate Bill 398 asks for more information from the statewide JJOC and asks them to let us \nknow what their legislative priorities are.  I would like to go now to Administrator Armstrong \nand anyone else who would like to speak in support and defer questions until after that. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWould you like them to be able to testify in support or be a part of your overall presentation? \n \nSenator Ohrenschall: \nWith your permission, I would like them to be part of the overall presentation. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThat is fine.   \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 21, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nRoss Armstrong, Administrator, Division of Child and Family Services, Department of \nHealth and Human Services: \nIn 2017, the Legislature passed a sweeping juvenile justice reform act.  One of the key parts \nof that was the establishment of the Juvenile Justice Oversight Commission.  They had to \ndevelop a five-year strategic plan [Exhibit E].  The current strategic plan focuses on the \nfollowing four main goals:  evidence-based practices and programs used by our service \nproviders and our government entities; allowing a risk and needs assessment and mental \nhealth  screenings  to  help  inform  court  and  other  actor  decisions;  collaboration  across \ndifferent  child-serving  systems  to  meet  its  needs;  and  family  engagement  plans, \nunderstanding that an engaged family is the best way to increase success for a young person. \n \nThe JJOC has made big progress toward those goals.  It has implemented an evidence-based \nrisk assessment which is giving us so much information about our juvenile justice system and \nthe kids we are serving—more so than ever before.  We have adopted and are working \ntoward concrete and uniform data-reporting measures so we can have even more information.  \nThis bill helps us set up the second five-year strategic plan for success.  The first strategic \nplan is set to expire in 2023.  Before we get to the 2023 Session, we would like to know what \nhas gone well in the first five-year strategic plan and what legislative changes we might need \nto be even more successful in those second five years.  It helps smooth out the awkward \ntiming of where the legislative session lands and where the five-year strategic plan runs.   \n \nThis bill requires the JJOC to provide an update on the five-year strategic plan and provide \nany  specific  legislative  recommendations  related  to  improvement  for  the  next  five-year \nstrategic plan.  Addressing the disparities in the juvenile justice system related to race and \nethnicity is a federal requirement that we have now put into state law to help us make sure we \ncontinue to move the needle on that.  Concerning compliance with any federal juvenile \njustice acts, sometimes Congress will pass a bill and we find ourselves out of alignment, so \nare there any legislative changes we need to make to be sure we are in compliance with all \nthose federal requirements?   \n \nWith that, I will hand it back over to the Senator.   \n \nSenator Ohrenschall: \nWhen the JJOC was first formed, I had the honor to serve on the advisory committee.  At one \nof the meetings, we had presentations from children who had finished some of the programs \nat the Caliente Youth Center or at the Nevada Youth Training Center in Elko.  The children \ntold us what they thought was working, what they thought needed improvement, and it was \nvery important in terms of trying to shape some of the legislation that, hopefully, you will be \nseeing in some committees this session.   \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 21, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nRoss Armstrong: \nLeslie Bittleston and Kathryn Roose are here to answer any questions, but I wanted to note \nthat there is a letter of support from the current co-chairs of the JJOC and they are willing, \nready, and excited about the opportunity to participate in the bill if it is passed [Exhibit F]. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any questions regarding S.B. 398?  [There were none.]  We will now go to \ntestimony in support of S.B. 398. \n \nDaShun  Jackson,  Director  of  Children's  Safety  and  Welfare  Policy,  Children's \nAdvocacy Alliance: \nThe Children's Advocacy Alliance is in support of S.B. 398.  We believe it is essential for the \nreform of the juvenile justice system. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any other callers on the line in support?  [There were none.]  Do we have any \ncallers in opposition?  [There were none.]  Do we have any callers in neutral?  [There were \nnone.]  I will turn this over to you, Senator Ohrenschall, for any closing remarks. \n \nSenator Ohrenschall: \nThank you, members of the Committee, for hearing S.B. 398.  The more children we can \ndivert from ending up at either local or state correctional facilities, the better.  It will be a \nsuccess if they can stay at home or stay in the community and receive therapy and treatment.  \nI believe S.B. 398 will go a long way toward achieving that. \n \nI want to thank Judge Egan Walker of the Second Judicial District, who serves as one of the \nco-chairs of the JJOC since its formation, as well as Joey Orduna-Hastings for their tireless \nwork trying to improve outcomes for children caught up in the court system.  I want to thank \nAdministrator Ross Armstrong who has worked so diligently trying to make sure that if \nchildren do end up in a state correctional facility, they try to get them therapy and treatment \nthat will help them land on their feet once they go home and also trying to help find homes \nfor these children because that is often a struggle he and his division face.  Thank you for \nhearing the bill, and I hope you will consider moving it forward. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 21, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you and thank you for your unwavering support for children in our state.  With that, \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 398.  At this time, I will open the line for public comment \nbecause there is no one in the room.  [There were no callers.]  That concludes our meeting for \ntoday.  Our next meeting will be on Friday, April 23, 2021, at the call of the Chair.  We will \nbe hearing some bills that came from the Senate and have been referred to our Committee.  \nThe meeting is adjourned [at 2:21 p.m.].        \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nTerry Horgan \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nAssemblywoman Rochelle T.

Committee rules and protocol were explained.]  Today, we have two bill \nhearings.    At  this  time,  I  will  open  the  bill  hearing  on  Senate  Bill  251  (1st  Reprint).  \nWelcome, Senator Gansert, and please begin when you are ready.  \n \nSenate Bill 251 (1st Reprint):  Revises provisions relating to genetic counseling and \ntesting. (BDR 40-478) \n \nSenator Heidi Seevers Gansert, Senate District No. 15: \nToday I am joined by Dr. Nathan Slotnick and my friend Abbi Whitaker.  Dr. Slotnick is an \nexpert on genetics and will be talking at length about hereditary mutations for the breast \ncancer (BRCA) 1 and breast cancer (BRCA) 2 genes.  Dr. Nathan Slotnick is a medical \ngeneticist and high-risk obstetrician and is board-certified in both disciplines.  He has also \nseen many pediatric and adult obstetric patients for 18 years, and he relocated to Nevada in \n2003.    In  2005,  he  was  asked to start  a  cancer  genetics program  by  a  local  oncology \npractitioner group.  That group has grown dramatically and now has a total of more than \n4,000 cancer patients seen.  He has also been a University of Nevada, Reno School of \nMedicine faculty member and has been widely published on a number of cancer, genetic, and \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 23, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nhigh-risk  obstetric  topics.    In  November  2020,  he  was  named  medical  director  of \nreproductive genetic medicine at Invitae Corporation, a large international genetic testing and \nservices organization.   \n \nI also have Abbi Whitaker, who is a long-time friend of mine, with me on Zoom.  She is a \nwell-respected, award-winning communications specialist and entrepreneur who founded her \nown business, The Abbi Agency, with her husband Ty.  The Abbi Agency's tagline is \"Where \nChutzpah Meets Acumen,\" which perfectly describes my friend.  What people do not know \nabout Abbi is that she is also a cancer survivor.  Since Abbi is with us today, I am going  \nto  have  her  share  her  own  story,  but  I  will  say,  when  Abbi  first  called  me  about  \nsponsoring a bill about BRCA, I said I would do it, of course.  I realized she was one of  \na half-dozen friends who have been affected by the BRCA 1 and 2 genetic mutations.  Each \nof my friends had cancer at an early age or had a family history and possible genetic link but \nit had not been connected.  They were not told, so their diagnoses sometimes were quite late.  \nThe screening, referral, and testing contemplated in Senate Bill 251 (1st Reprint) is very \nimportant for each woman and is also critical for the families of women who have tested \npositive for BRCA mutations.  I will now ask Dr. Nathan Slotnick to give us a brief review of \nBRCA 1 and 2 mutations, and then I will ask Abbi to tell her story.      \n \nRobert  Nathan  Slotnick,  M.D.,  Ph.D.,  Director,  Medical  Genetics  and  Genomics, \nInvitae Corporation:  \nI  am  a  medical  geneticist.    I  have  had  a  long-standing  and  abiding  interest  in  cancer \nhereditary  predisposition,  testing,  molecular  genetics,  and  ways  of  offering  these \nopportunities to both clinicians and patients in the state of Nevada.  I have put together a \nshort presentation that will detail the clinical and scientific background that allows us to \naddress these issues [Exhibit C]. \n \nToday we are going to address the issues of genetics and genomics in cancer, but I will put a \nplug in at the end of my presentation about how the technology that allows us to have this \ndiscussion today is applicable to virtually every other clinical entity in medicine and how we \nshould consider it when we think about future directions that medicine and medical practice \nwill take. \n \nLet us start first talking about the genetics of cancer and about what the etiology, or cause of \ncancer, really is [page 2].  Cancer is due to an alteration in the DNA of specific genes within \nspecific cells of the body.  If the alteration occurs within one of the many cellular control \ngenes, normal cellular control can be lost.  That damaged cell reproduces into more control-\nless cells, and a tumor can develop.  Further loss of control results in spread away from the \noriginal  cell's  location.    That  is  called  \"metastatic  disease.\"    Therefore,  all  cancers  are \ngenetic, meaning that they have a DNA etiology, but not all cancers are hereditary.  In every \nsense, then, cancer is a genetic disease. \n \nLet us talk about what that means [page 3].  Every geneticist I have known all the years \nI have been in practice has the habit of, whenever we come across something unusual, we \nhave a file cabinet and when we have a chance to look back at it or as technology advances, \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 23, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nwe are able to make some statements in that regard.  Starting in the 1950s, genetics doctors \nhave put into their file cabinets very interesting family trees having to do with cancer.  What \nthey found was something called \"hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome\" or HBOC.  \nEach of the family trees have specific predictions they manifest.  Hereditary HBOC family \ntrees generally show breast cancer before the age of 50, ovarian cancer frequently at any age, \nmale breast cancer—which is really rare otherwise—frequently multifocal or bilateral breast \ncancer, and frequently associated with certain ethnic backgrounds as well.  These can be \ncontrasted with non-hereditary types of cancers, which do not have these characteristics.  As \nwe have learned more about HBOC, it has evolved into a direct association with BRCA 1 \nand 2 genes. \n \nLooking at what this means in a clinical context [page 4, Exhibit C], by age 40, 1 in 200 \nwomen in the population will have developed breast cancer.  But if you have a mutation in \nBRCA 1 or BRCA 2, it is more like a 10 to 20 percent risk that breast cancer will occur.  By \nage 50, 2 percent of the population of women will have breast cancer; a BRCA mutation will \nincrease that dramatically to 33 to 50 percent.  Over a woman's lifetime, 12 percent of the \npopulation of women in this country will develop breast cancer.  With a BRCA 1 or 2 \nmutation, that risk goes to 56 percent up to 87 percent.  These ranges occur because different \nstudies make different predictions; but one way or the other, this is a huge increase in the risk \nof developing breast cancer. \n \nIt also affects the development of ovarian cancer [page 5].  Approximately 1 percent of the \nfemale population in this country will develop ovarian cancer during her lifetime, but with \nBRCA 1 or 2 gene mutations, those risks go up dramatically.  I am sure all of you know that \novarian cancer is frequently not diagnosed until it has disseminated throughout the body and \nthen it is very difficult, if not impossible, to treat. \n \nIf you look at all the HBOC patients [page 6], you will find that approximately 80 to \n85 percent will have either a BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 mutation.  However, it has become \nobvious that there are many other genes involved in this hereditary predisposition as well.  It \nis more than just the development of cancer; it includes considerations of the development of \na second, independent cancer [page 7].  Five percent of all women who will develop breast \ncancer within five years of the original diagnosis will develop a second breast cancer, but if \nyou have a mutation in either BRCA 1 or BRCA 2, that number goes to 12 to 20 percent.  \nOver a woman's lifetime, if she develops breast cancer, the risk of a second primary breast \ncancer is about 11 percent, but with a mutation in either BRCA 1 or BRCA 2, it goes up to 40 \nto 60 percent.  So knowing a patient's BRCA status is crucial in knowing how to treat her \nwell, how to treat her medically. \n \nIt  is  more  than  just  recurrent  disease  [page  8].    A  patient  with  male  breast  cancer  is \nremarkably rare, but if you have a mutation in BRCA 1 or 2, especially BRCA 2, that risk \ngoes up to 7 percent of the male population will develop breast cancer.  Prostate cancer risks \ngo up dramatically.  We are currently recommending BRCA 1 or 2 testing for every prostate \ncancer patient.  Melanoma risks go up dramatically and pancreatic cancer risks go up as well, \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 23, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nand  we  are  currently  recommending  BRCA  1  or  2  testing  for  patients  diagnosed  with \npancreatic cancer. \n \nWhy are we doing this?  Obviously, knowing in advance makes it easier to identify patients \nat risk and surveil them differently, but it is more than that.  We know that if you have a \nmutation on BRCA 1 or 2, something as simple as administering tamoxifen, which is a \nmedication, will reduce that patient's risk of breast cancer by 50 percent [page 9].  Ovarian \ncancer risk can be modified as well.  Something as simple as a patient taking birth control \npills can reduce the risk of that patient developing ovarian cancer—even if she has a BRCA 1 \nor 2 mutation—by up to 60 percent.  You can do more.   \n \nWe are currently recommending patients with BRCA 1 or 2 mutations consider bilateral \nmastectomies  [page  10,  Exhibit  C]  as  a  risk-reducing  prophylactic  measure.    Usually, \ndiscussion with a breast specialist is recommended and can be done in the 40- to 60-year-old \nage range.  That can reduce risks dramatically.  We know we can further reduce a woman's \nrisk of breast cancer by removing her ovaries and fallopian tubes, usually recommended at \nage 35 to 40; and we know we can reduce the risk of an ovarian cancer developing by \nremoving  a  patient's  ovaries  and  fallopian  tubes.  Usually  this  is  discussed  with  35-  to  \n40-year-olds. \n \nLet me try to present the concept of more than one genus involved here.  Every human adult \nhas approximately 30 trillion cells in their body.  Those 30 trillion cells are the result of many \ncell  divisions  from  a  single  fertilized  egg.    Every  time  a  cell  divides  and  there  are  \ntwo products, we assume that those two products should be genetically identical, but they are \nnot.  Every time a cell divides, the 3 billion base pairs of DNA that are in the mother cell \nneed to be reproduced, and we know mistakes happen.  The fidelity of replication of DNA is \nimperfect.  Every time a cell divides, instead of having two genetically identical daughter \ncells, you have two daughter cells that are not genetically identical.  Every time those errors \noccur, one type of error, as you can see on the left side of the screen [page 11], is something \ncalled the DNA double-strand break.  Every time that occurs, all the genes that are listed here \nin pink, blue, and gray are called to attention.  They work together to attempt to repair the \nmistake that happens during cell replication—that DNA double-stranded break.  If everything \nworks well, the repair works fine, and we are back to a normal state.  Any time there is a \nmutation in any one of the genes you see here, mistakes are not corrected as easily; they can \naccumulate, and cancers can occur.  When we talk about genetic testing, although we are \nfocusing today on BRCA 1 and BRCA 2, we need to also consider all these other genes that \nare potentially related to the inability of DNA repair and the development of cancer. \n \nAgain, what is the process here?  We use a sequencing tool.  Remember, of the 3 billion base \npairs  of  DNA,  when  we  look  at  the  DNA  and  judge  whether  there  are  mutations,  we \nsequence that DNA [page 12].  The cost of sequencing the whole human genome 20 years \nago was $100 million up to $300 million, and those numbers come out of the Human \nGenome Project.  I am anticipating that within the next two years, we will be able to DNA \nsequence a whole human genome, clinically use that information for less than $500.  It is \ngoing to create some rather dramatic changes in our ability to identify patients at risk—not \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 23, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \njust for cancer, but for cardiovascular disease, developmental delay in children, birth defects, \nand many other conditions as well.  It is all because these sequencing tools have become \nmuch more powerful and much less expensive.     \n \nChair Nguyen: \nSenator Gansert, do you have any other presenters? \n \nSenator Seevers Gansert: \nI wanted to thank Dr. Slotnick for going over that with us.  There are two numbers I want \nyou to remember from that presentation:  87 and 44.  As a woman, if you test positive for \nBRCA 1 or 2 during your lifetime, the odds of your getting breast cancer are as high as \n87 percent and 44 percent for ovarian cancer.  Now my friend Abbi Whitaker will tell you \nher story. \n \nAbbi Whitaker, Private Citizen, Reno, Nevada: \nI am a cancer survivor.  I had cancer ten years ago.  It was not breast cancer; it was an HPV-\nrelated cancer, but it leads into this story.  I have been getting mammograms for five years, \nand this year I switched to Reno Diagnostic Center for my mammogram.  For the first time, \nthey gave me a screening that asked some questions about my family history and flagged me \nfor genetic testing.  It was free, they gave me the genetic test, and it came back positive for \nBRCA 2.  I had already been through chemo and radiation with another cancer, and those of \nyou who have been through that experience know that the chemo and radiation are part of the \ncrappiness, but the five-year waiting period to make sure you do not come out of remission is \nalso a tough situation.  When I found out I was BRCA 2, I decided I wanted to have a double \nmastectomy.  I had a double mastectomy last Thursday.  I am eight days out and I am \ndefinitely  still  not  myself,  but  I  am  really  glad,  especially  after  hearing  Dr.  Slotnick's \npresentation, that I had the chance to do that.   \n \nEven being a cancer survivor, I would never have known—if Reno Diagnostic Center had \nnot asked me those questions and flagged me for genetic testing—I would never have known \nI was BRCA 2, and I would have never been able to make that decision to have a double \nmastectomy and take my health care into my own hands.  Senate Bill 251 (1st Reprint) is \ngoing to give every woman that chance through different types of screening.  As moms, as \nsisters, as grandmothers, as legislators, we have so much on our plates, and we do not always \nknow what is wrong with us.  This bill gives women a chance to know that and to make a \ndecision, as I did, to have a double mastectomy or, as Dr. Slotnick said, some of the other \noptions.  I thank you for listening, and I thank Senator Seevers Gansert for all the work you \nput into this and all the cosponsors from all sides of the aisle.  Women in Nevada are going to \nbe healthier and better off because of this.  Thank you very much. \n \nSenator Seevers Gansert: \nThis bill raises awareness around the BRCA 1 and 2 mutations in a couple of ways.  It also \nmakes sure that if a woman has a high probability of having the BRCA 1 or 2 gene—which is \na personal history or family history—she gets referred for counseling and testing.  Under the \nACA  [Patient  Protection  and  Affordable  Care  Act]  with  the  United  States  Preventive \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 23, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nServices Task Force, that is covered.  This does not expand or require any more insurance \ncoverage or any more payments.  These services are covered.  The way the awareness should \ngo up is that when you get a mammogram, you will receive a notice.  Right now, you receive \na notice if you have high-density breast tissue.  This adds another notice to make you aware \nthat certain types of cancers are indicators and that you should talk to your physician or \nprimary health care provider about potentially getting screened or getting tested.  It also \nrequires that your primary health care physician does that type of assessment—which they \nshould already be doing—but we are putting it in statute.  These types of services are already \ncovered under federal law.  We are putting this in Nevada statute to make sure they continue \nto be covered. \n \nAgain, I want to thank Abbi Whitaker for her story and also want to tell you a brief one.  \nI had a friend whom I knew for 25 years.  I never knew her without cancer.  I met her when \nour daughters were in first grade.  She died last year of breast cancer.  More recently she was \ntested, so this connecting the dots—that you could be BRCA 1 or 2—is not always being \nconnected, to make sure they get testing.  Well, she tested within the last five years and she \ntested positive for BRCA.  While she ended up dying, what was so significant about her \ntesting and getting tested was that her daughters needed to be tested.  Also, one time when \nshe was fighting breast cancer, her sister was also fighting breast cancer.  In the end, there are \nsix cousins between the two mothers, and all of them are positive for BRCA.  One who is  \n32 years old has already had a bilateral mastectomy because that was the choice she made \nwhen she conferred with her physician. \n \nWomen need to get tested so they know their risk, and then their daughters and potentially \ntheir sons need to get tested.  The male breast cancer risk is lower—about 7 percent—but that \nis significant as well.  Women who test positive for this gene and connecting those dots is so \nimportant.  The test is really easy and inexpensive and sometimes it is free.  Thank you for \nyour attention today. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you, Senator, and thank you, Ms. Whitaker, for sharing your story and being here. \nI forget how accessible we are this session under these protocols that allow someone to come \nhere,  share their  story, and  make  a  real impact,  considering  your  circumstances.    I  do \nappreciate that.  We have a couple of questions from Committee members. \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nThank you, Senator Gansert, for bringing this bill.  I very much like it.  One of the reasons \nyou are proposing this is because it is a recommended screening by the United States \nPreventive Services Task Force, which makes me wonder:  should we be thinking about \nbroadening this?  Are there other recommendations by the Task Force that we should be \nmaking sure doctors follow when they see patients? \n \nSenator Seevers Gansert: \nRight now, we are focused on BRCA 1 and 2 because there are probably other ones out there.  \nWhat is helpful for these is that they are covered by insurance.  We wanted to make sure we \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 23, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nat least addressed these two mutations because of the research that has been done and the \nobvious numbers.  When Dr. Slotnick and I first talked, he was interested in a lot of different \nmutations that could potentially be evaluated, but since these are the ones before us, we are \nfocusing on these.  There may be legislation brought forward in the future that would cover \nmore. \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nIn section 1, subsection 3, on page 3, lines 24 to 26, you talk about sanctions for failure to \ncomply.  There are no criminal penalties, which makes sense, and no professional discipline, \nso I assume you are leaving open the possibility of a malpractice lawsuit for failure to \ncomply.  Is that correct?  It seems odd that you could be sued for malpractice and held \naccountable but no follow-up for professional discipline. \n \nSenator Seevers Gansert: \nNevada Revised Statutes Chapter 457 is the Nevada chapter on cancer.  In that chapter, if you \ndo not follow everything in there—and there are a variety of things including child support \npayments—you can have a misdemeanor or felony.  What I was trying to do was make sure \nthat physicians or primary care providers were providing these assessments, but not penalize \nthem with a misdemeanor or felony.  They are already doing some family history, but this is \nmore because you have to ask about grandparents, aunts, uncles, and so forth.  I did not \ncontemplate  anything  about  malpractice  insurance.    This  is  about  trying  to  get  women \nassessed and taking the first step to see if they need to get genetic testing. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI appreciate the conversation about this.  During the past decade, it has been so interesting to \nwatch how our legislation has responded to advances in medical care—starting off with \nrequiring mammograms and talking a couple of years later about dense breast tissue.  We \nhave had hearty debates in this Committee about how we respond to the new sciences \ncoming out and then being here with the BRCA testing.  That is just an observation about the \nevolution of our statutes to respond in medicine.  Sometimes we cannot keep up with all the \ngood things that are out there. \n \nFor the record, so we can flesh out the continuing education piece, typically, and what \nI imagine you would want, is that once enacted, the licensing boards would set the number of \nhours of continuing medical education required.  That is typically how it works if the class \nyou attend is three hours long, it would be worth three hours of credits.  The typical model.   \nI do not see any hours prescribed in here, so I assume the intent is for the licensing boards to \npromulgate regulations as they ordinarily would in regard to the amount of credits for the \nhours spent in that educational activity. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 23, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nSenator Seevers Gansert: \nI  wanted  to  make  sure,  if  you  take  courses  on  genetics,  that  they  qualified  and  were \nacceptable to whichever organization was your licensing agency.  I was not requiring a \ncertain number of hours in genetics.  We wanted to make sure that if you took classes in \ngenetics that had been qualified—usually by a national organization—that they would be \nacceptable toward the CMEs [continuing medical education].   \n \nResponding to your first comment, you and I know what a heavy lift some of those were—\nmaking sure mammograms were covered and prostate screens, and so forth.  As a result, I am \nreally happy to bring this forward, especially because it is already covered at the federal \nlevel.  It used to be very difficult to have some of these things that really save money in the \nlong term.  Preventive health services are truly important, so thank you. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any other questions?  [There were none.]  At this time, we will begin testimony in \nsupport, opposition, and neutral.  There is no one in person, so we will go to the lines for \ncallers in support of S.B. 251 (R1). \n \nConnor Cain, representing Comprehensive Cancer Centers of Nevada: \nWe encourage your support of this important bill. \n \nTess Opferman, representing Nevada Women's Lobby: \nWe want to thank Senator Seevers Gansert for her hard work on this bill.  Here are some \nnumbers  to  do  with  the  BRCA  mutation:    About  13  percent  of  women  in  the  general \npopulation will develop breast cancer sometime in their life.  By contrast, 55 to 72 percent of \nwomen who inherit the harmful BRCA 1 variant and 45 to 69 percent of women who inherit \nthe harmful BRCA 2 variant will develop breast cancer.  For ovarian cancer, it is also \nsignificantly higher for those who have the BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 gene mutations.  These \nnumbers are significant.  Ensuring that women are screened and those who are at risk have \nthe ability to get genetic testing is critical to preventive care.  This bill will, quite literally, \nsave lives.  We urge your support and thank you for your time today. \n \nWesley Falconer, Chief Operating Officer, Cancer Care Specialists, Reno, Nevada: \nWe  would  like  to  express  the  utmost  support  for  this  bill,  and  we  believe  preventive \nscreening is the way to go with all cancer treatments going forward. \n \n[The following testimony in support was taken later in the meeting and reclassified here as \nrequested by Chair Nguyen.] \n \nSowjanya Reganti, M.D., Private Citizen, Reno, Nevada: \nI am a medical oncologist at Cancer Care Specialists.  I would like to totally support this bill \nand say \"thank you\" to Senator Gansert for bringing it up because it is very important for \nprevention when there is a family history.   \n \n[Exhibit D in support was submitted but not discussed and will become part of the record.] \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 23, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAt this time, I will ask if there are any callers in opposition to S.B. 251 (R1).  [There were \nnone.] \n \n[Exhibit E in opposition was submitted but not discussed and will become part of the record.] \n \nIs there anyone who would like to testify in neutral to S.B. 251 (R1)? \n \nErin Lynch, Chief, Medical Programs Unit, Division of Health Care Financing and \nPolicy, Department of Health and Human Services:    \nThe Division is testifying in neutral on S.B. 251 (R1).  Within Nevada Medicaid, we already \ncover BRCA 1 and 2 screening, testing, and genetic counseling for women who meet the \ncriteria of the bill in the United States Preventive Services Task Force.  Therefore, we have a \nzero-dollar fiscal note on this bill. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nMadam secretary, please reclassify the testimony from Dr. Reganti into support testimony.  \nIs there anyone else on the line?  [There was no one.]  Senator, I will turn this over to you for \nany closing remarks. \n \nSenator Seevers Gansert: \nThank you, Madam Chair, and members of the Committee.  I also want to thank Dr. Reganti.  \nShe was seeing patients and was texting me that she was delayed.  I also want to thank  \nErin  Lynch  who  testified  that  there  was  a  zero-dollar  fiscal  note.    This  will  increase \nawareness and help connect the dots so women who have the indications that they need to get \ncounseling and testing will get it.  The numbers are astronomical as far as your odds of \ngetting breast and ovarian cancer and other cancers, and that is why it is so important for a \nwoman and her family.  I appreciate the time today, and I would appreciate your support for \nthe bill. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAt this time, I will close the hearing on Senate Bill 251 (1st Reprint) and open the hearing on \nSenate Bill 156 (1st Reprint).   \n \nSenate Bill 156 (1st Reprint):  Revises provisions relating to crisis stabilization centers. \n(BDR 40-488) \n \nSenator Julia Ratti, Senate District No. 13: \nSenate Bill 156 (1st Reprint) is one component of several I will bring forward to you over \nthe course of the remaining portion of the session that seek to address basically rebuilding \nthe way we respond to a person who is experiencing a behavioral health crisis.  I have a \nfour-minute video I would like to show you which is an overview of how we could look at \nbehavioral health crises [page 1, Exhibit F].  I was fortunate enough to be part of a group \nworking  during  the  interim  through  the  Legislative  Committee  on  Health  Care  that \nparticipated with a group of folks who made a field trip to Maricopa County to check out the \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 23, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nwork being done in Arizona to change the system.  Arizona was one of the earliest adopters \ntrying to look at how we respond to crisis differently.  Since then, several other states have \nadopted this approach to crisis intervention. \n \nI was astounded at the difference they have been able to make there in terms of outcomes for \npeople who are experiencing behavioral health crises.  Certainly, in the year this nation has \nexperienced, and with the results of the George Floyd trial we are all grappling with this \nweek, I think there has been a growing understanding in our nation that law enforcement is \nnot the appropriate tool for crisis response.  For too long, we have not built an appropriate \ncrisis response system based more on using behavioral health professionals and peers with \nlived experience.  Instead, whenever we have a person who is in crisis, someone calls 911.  \nThat operator on the other end says, \"Police, fire, or health emergency?\"  If it is interpreted as \nbeing police or health, we are going to roll a law enforcement officer and an ambulance, \nneither of which is actually the appropriate tool in most behavioral health crises. \n \nThis model is continuing to evolve into how we roll the right resource in the very beginning.  \nToday's bill deals with the third part of the model, which is the crisis stabilization centers.  \nThat is a critical part of the model in terms of when someone is in a crisis and being able to \ndivert them either from the jail system or emergency rooms (ERs).  I will be bringing a \ncouple of other bills forward to you that will deal with the crisis call point of care, which is \nreally the triage that will make sure the right resources are getting out, and another bill that \nwill talk about licensing of the peer professionals—those people with lived experiences who \nwould be part of that response in many cases, instead of law enforcement. \n \nNow I will focus more on the system of care so you understand where this fits in, and then \nI will talk about the specifics of this bill.  Based on the Crisis Now model, the first step is that \nhigh-tech  crisis  call  center.    In  Nevada,  we  have  Crisis  Support  Services  of  Nevada, \na statewide, national suicide hotline.  That is a huge asset for us as a starting point.   \n \nThese are the four components:  the call center; the 24/7 mobile crisis teams; the crisis \nstabilization centers; and the underlying set of essential principles and practices that are \ncritically important [page 2, Exhibit F].   \n \nIf we look at the high-tech crisis call centers, these crisis call centers have behavioral health \nspecialists who can do both the de-escalation of a crisis on a phone line as well as some \nfollow-up case management and care [page 3].  So we have helped the person de-escalate and \nthen we are making sure they are connected to whatever follow-up resources they may need.  \nThat is the first important step.  In research from where this model is operational in other \ncommunities, 90 percent of calls concerning someone in a crisis can be stabilized over the \nphone and can be responsibly triaged for follow-up care.  What is important for this model is \nthat the crisis call center is high-tech.  Because of that, there is a system in the background \nwhere they communicate with all the care facilities.  They know where there are outpatient \nappointments, where medication can be accessed, and where there are beds that can be \naccessed.  If that person does need care, they can be immediately placed into that system of \ncare. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 23, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \n \nThe next part is 24/7 mobile crisis teams [page 4].  We have done some work in the state to \nset up mobile crisis teams.  In the 2019 Session, we created CCBHCs, which are certified \ncommunity-based behavioral health centers.  One requirement of those is to have a mobile \ncrisis team.  So we have taken some steps forward, and there is additional work happening \nnow concerning how we make sure there is a good Medicaid model to reimburse these crisis \nteams.  There is some work coming on the national level on more support for mobile crisis \nteams. \n \nWe have taken care of the 90 percent, but now there is the 10 percent who cannot be \nstabilized over the phone.  That high-tech, high-touch call center can dispatch a mobile crisis \nteam.  That mobile crisis team is a behavioral health professional—a licensed social worker, \npsychologist, psychiatrist, APRN [advanced practice registered nurse] with a psychiatrist \nendorsement—and  a  peer  with  lived  experience—someone  who  is  in  recovery  from  a \nbehavioral health disorder or substance use disorder and can relate to that person in a very \ndifferent way sometimes than a differently situated behavioral health professional can.  In \nthis case, this is where you start to see the alleviation of rolling law enforcement at all or \nrolling an ambulance at all.  If there is not a medical emergency and there is not a safety \nissue, but you have an individual in crisis, this is the appropriate team to deal with that crisis. \n \nThat brings us to the point of this bill—the crisis stabilization centers [page 5, Exhibit F].  \nThere is a small portion—about 1 to 2 percent—who cannot be stabilized by either the phone \nor the crisis team, and they need to go to a facility.   As the video indicated, in our current \nmodel they end up in one of two places.  They either end up in the jail because the behavior \nassociated with their mental health crisis is perceived to be violent or they are harming \nsomeone, or they end up in the emergency room so they do not harm themselves.  In either \ncase, they typically end up in some sort of isolation where there is a great period of time \nduring which they are getting no contact from anybody except for being checked for vitals \nand making sure they stay alive.  In this model, they go to something known more as a \n\"living room model.\"  These are short-term, subacute care for these individuals.  In this living \nroom model, there are recliners and chairs and tables set up for conversation.  The staffing is \nbehavioral health professionals and peers with lived experience.  So the exact opposite \nhappens because there is as much engagement as can possibly be done in 23 hours and \n59 minutes.  That 23 hours and 59 minutes is important because once you get past one day, it \nflips the patient into \"other licensed facilities,\" so if someone needs more than 23 hours and \n59 minutes of care, that person can be leveled up to an actual inpatient center.  At that point, \nit is appropriate for them to go into an inpatient setting.  If they can be stabilized and leveled \ndown,  they  can  be  discharged  with  an  appropriate  case  management  plan  so  they  are \nconnected to ongoing outpatient services and medication—whatever their needs are for them \nto stay stable.  In the 2019 Session we passed legislation to create these crisis stabilization \ncenters, but we did not get it quite right.  Senate Bill 156 (1st Reprint) seeks to get crisis \nstabilization right, and that is why I am here with you today.   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 23, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nI want to touch on essential crisis care principles [page 6].  Whether you are talking about the \ncall line, the mobile outreach team, or the crisis stabilization, these principles are very \nimportant:   \n \n•  That it has a recovery orientation.  The idea going in is that people have the ability to \nrecover.   \n \n•  That it is trauma-informed.  For many folks experiencing a behavioral health crisis or \nsubstance use disorder, part of the reason is that they have experienced some sort of \ntrauma in the past. \n   \n•  That it has a significant use of peer staff—people with lived experience who look \nlike, talk like, and have something in common with the folks they are helping. \n \n•  A  commitment  to  zero  suicide  and  suicide  safer  care  principles—something  the \nHealth and Human Services Committees have talked about a lot. \n \n•  Strong commitments to safety, of course. \n \n•  Collaboration with law enforcement, so when that call comes in—it might come in to \n911, it might come in to a new phone number we are developing, but if those  \ntwo systems are not talking with each other, and law enforcement on the street is not \naware of and collaborating closely with this parallel system, then it does not work. \n \nWe are very fortunate in the state of Nevada that we have created something called MOST \n[mobile  outreach  safety  team]  teams  which  is  a  social  worker  riding  along  with  law \nenforcement.  They will be the critical connection between these two systems, along with the \ntriage that has to happen at the phone-call level to make sure folks get into the right place. \n \nThat is the system.  So again, S.B. 156 (R1) focuses on the third aspect of the system, the \ncrisis stabilization centers and making sure we get the licensing correct.  The reason it is \nimportant that we get the licensing correct is, if we get the licensing correct, then these \nfacilities will be more eligible for Medicaid billing, and Medicaid dollars will be able to flow \nthrough to create the business model that allows these to be successful.  As these crisis \nstabilization centers were originally set up, we imagined them to be psychiatric hospitals, but \nthat was a very narrow group of facilities that could actually step up and serve in that role, so \nthe whole purpose of this bill is to broaden the number of facilities.  As long as they meet the \nlicensing criteria, they could step up and fill the role of crisis stabilization centers. \n \nI very much appreciate the indulgence of the Committee to allow me to take you through the \nentire crisis care model because I am hoping I will be coming back before you with the other \npieces of it; but today, it is a relatively simple bill on the licensing of the stabilization centers. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you for your presentation.  Do we have any questions from Committee members? \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 23, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nThis issue is of utmost concern.  My district includes many of the community groups that \nserve people who are homeless, and many who have mental illness come to our community \nfor assistance.  Do you see these mobile response units replacing the MOST teams?  Mobile \noutreach safety teams almost always include a police officer.  I have not asked for any data, \nbut I am not sure how that is being received or their success rates.  If you have any \ninformation about that, I would love to know. \n \nSenator Ratti: \nThe MOST teams were funded by the state, but then pushed out to the local level, so to get \ndata about effectiveness or impact, we would need to have the folks from Clark County and \nWashoe County talk about that.  In Washoe County in my role—I work with and am familiar \nwith the MOST teams there—and the answer is no.  I do not see the mobile outreach teams \nreplacing the MOST teams, and here is why.  For some people who are experiencing a \nbehavioral health crisis, there is a true public safety issue.  It would be inappropriate to roll a \npeer and a behavioral health professional into that situation.  You can imagine issues around \ndomestic  violence;  you  can  imagine  issues  where  someone  is  further  along  the  suicide \nideation process and is getting close to actually using a weapon to fulfill their own suicide.  \nI am sure, if I had a MOST team social worker here, they could talk to you about the wide \nvariety of reasons why there are certain calls they would not want to roll on without law \nenforcement. \n \nThe way it would need to work is at that first level when the calls are coming in, that triage is \ncritically important and that the right questions get answered.  Nine-one-one systems are \nalready pretty brilliant at this.  They have very detailed \"if this, then what\" processes and \nsystems to figure out what is the right resource to roll and to give the folks who are rolling \nthe most information possible.  As they are going through that triage system, if this appears \nto be a behavioral health case that does not have a public safety issue, then it should go over \nto a different system and the suicide hotline system.  If it still has a public safety issue, we \nshould still be rolling law enforcement.  In the best-case scenario, that is a MOST team that \nincludes a social worker.  Then you have the benefit of a social worker and law enforcement \nin those public safety scenarios. \n \nThe other piece that has happened in Washoe County that I think is incredibly important is \nthat, for these officers who are rolling with social workers, it is an on-the-job training that is \nirreplaceable and priceless because they get to see how the social worker is interacting with \nthe person they have come upon in this crisis, as opposed to how law enforcement would \ninteract.    While  I  think  it  would  be  very  difficult  to  quantify,  I  think  we  have  seen \ntremendous  benefit  in  Washoe  County  in  terms  of  how  law  enforcement  is  starting  to \napproach behavioral health crises when they are paired with a social worker and what they \nare learning from that.  So for the public health reason and for the training—because law \nenforcement is going to be the response for some of these calls—I think we want to have \nMOST and we would want to have triage and know when we have to roll MOST and when \nwe have to roll behavioral health crisis teams. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 23, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any other questions from Committee members?  Seeing none, we will begin \ntestimony in support, opposition, and neutral on S.B. 156 (R1). \n \nJoan Hall, President, Nevada Rural Hospital Partners: \nWe are here today and very supportive of S.B. 156 (R1).  We are very appreciative of \nSenator  Ratti  for  working  on  language  to  allow  rural  hospitals  to  be  involved  in  this \nimportant process.  These crisis stabilization centers are important in the Crisis Now system \nof care.  I was very fortunate to have actually seen them in practice in Colorado.  The \npositive  impact  on  patients  in  crisis,  law  enforcement,  and  EMS  [emergency  medical \nservices] was phenomenal.  I am very excited to see the impact this will have in Nevada, and \nI urge your support.  \n \nMary Walker, representing Carson City and Carson Tahoe Health: \nWe rise in support of S.B. 156 (R1) regarding crisis stabilization centers.  There is also \na letter of support [Exhibit G] from Alan Garrett, CEO and President of Carson Tahoe \nHealth, on NELIS [Nevada Electronic Legislative Information System].  Senate Bill 156 \n(1st Reprint) is an important bill for expanding access to care for mental health services in \nNevada.  Senate Bill 156 (1st Reprint) allows hospitals, not just psychiatric hospitals, the \nability to provide crisis stabilization services with the proper Medicaid reimbursement rates. \n \nSeveral years ago, Carson Tahoe Health opened the Mallory Behavioral Health Crisis Center \nto treat the most critical mental health needs in our area.  The Mallory Center has helped \nalleviate overcrowding in our ERs and jails; and the best thing of all is that these patients \nactually get the appropriate treatment they need through the Mallory Center rather than \nlanguishing in ER beds or the jails without treatment.  Over the last several years, hospital \nrepresentatives from Clark and Washoe Counties have talked to Carson Tahoe's behavioral \nhealth department regarding whether their own hospitals could open a similar crisis center.  \nHowever, when it became known that Medicaid only paid observation or office visit rates for \nthese  crisis  services,  the  other  hospitals  lost  interest.    We  believe  S.B.  156  (R1)  will \nincentivize other hospitals to open their own crisis stabilization centers.  It is a critical piece \nof access to care that is missing in today's health care marketplace.  We would like to thank \nSenator Ratti very much for bringing this bill forward and thank you for your time today. \n \nTrey Delap, representing Nevada Chapter, National Alliance on Mental Illness: \n[Trey Delap submitted his prepared testimony and additional information, Exhibit H.]  I am \nspeaking in support of S.B. 156 (R1).  The National Alliance on Mental Illness is a grassroots \nmental health organization dedicated to building better lives for the more than 400,000 \nNevadans affected by mental health concerns.  The National Alliance on Mental Illness \nbelieves that public policies and practices should promote access to care for people with \nmental health conditions.  We support the development and expansion of mental health crisis \nresponse systems in every community.  As noted by Senator Ratti, S.B. 156 (R1) addresses \nthe third core element of national guidelines for crisis care. Crisis stabilization programs \nshould provide a no-wrong-door access to mental health and substance use care, including \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 23, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \naccepting all walk-ins and ambulance, fire, and police drop-offs.  Data suggest that a high \nproportion of people in crisis who are evaluated for hospitalization, LOCUS [Level of Care \nUtilization System] levels V and VI, can be safely cared for in a crisis facility, and that the \noutcomes for these individuals are at least as good as hospital care, while the cost of crisis \ncare  is  substantially  less  than  the  cost  of  inpatient  care  and  accompanying  emergency \ndepartment medical clearance charges, and reduces law enforcement as the primary role as \nfirst responder to behavioral health emergencies. \n \nA well-designed crisis response system can be the difference between life and death for \npeople experiencing a psychiatric emergency.  Senate Bill 156 (1st Reprint) advances an \nessential piece of an effective community-based response so all people have access to the \nright treatment at the right time.  Thank you for hearing this bill, and we urge your support. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any other callers in support?   \n \nDan Musgrove, Chair, Clark County Children's Mental Health Consortium; Member, \nClark County Regional Behavioral Health Policy Board: \nToday, I am also representing a number of clients in the Las Vegas Valley Health System, \nthe hospitals, and WestCare Nevada, Inc.  This idea that the Legislature has been working on \nfor the last two sessions—the Crisis Now model—is so very important to the system of care \nwe have in Nevada, especially in Clark County where hospital emergency rooms are always \n[unintelligible]  those  who  need  care  in  a  much  better  location  than  the  hospital  EDs \n[emergency departments] can provide.  I want to compliment Senator Ratti for her leadership \non this subject as well as the Legislature.  We are absolutely in support of moving in this \ndirection. \n \n[Exhibit I in support was submitted but not discussed and will become part of the record.] \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any other callers in support?  [There were none.]  Do we have any callers in \nopposition?  [There were none.]  Do we have any callers in neutral? \n \nDuAne Young, Deputy Administrator, Division of Health Care Financing and Policy, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services: \nI want to thank you and Senator Ratti.  We are here to answer questions, but, of course, this \nis good policy and there is no fiscal note.  The changes in the bill will help a lot of providers, \nparticularly  those  servicing  the  rural  areas,  be  able  to  utilize  this  model  and  receive \nreimbursement from Medicaid. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI will turn this over to you, Senator Ratti, for any closing remarks. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 23, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nSenator Ratti: \nFirst, I need to correct myself.  I am using the term \"social worker\" too loosely.  The MOST \nteam members who are the behavioral health specialists are licensed clinicians.  Some of \nthem could be licensed clinical social workers, but they are licensed clinicians and not \nnecessarily all social workers.  While there is no fiscal note on this bill, a critical piece is that \nthe billing of Medicaid is.  You are just shifting it from putting a more expensive service to a \nless expensive service.  Over time, I believe there will be savings, but we are still standing up \nthe model and all its components.  In Phoenix, from the time they started working on it until \nthe time they had it fully in place was about a 13-year time frame.  We are about three years \ninto the process here in Nevada.  I think we can accelerate that significantly by being focused \nin our work and because so many folks have gone before us.  I am sincerely grateful to you \nfor making the time today for me to present this bill, and I hope you will support it. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWith that, I will close the hearing on S.B. 156 (R1).  At this time, we will go to the lines and \nask if there are any callers in public comment.  [There were none.]  That concludes our \nmeeting for today.  Meeting is adjourned [at 1:09 p.m.].           \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nTerry Horgan \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nAssemblywoman Rochelle T.

(BDR 38-743) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN CLARA THOMAS (Assembly District No. 17): \nI  am  presenting  A.B.  344  which  aims  to  improve  care,  coordination  and \ncontinuity of care for elderly Nevadans and individuals with disabilities following \ndischarge from the hospital. I have submitted my written remarks (Exhibit B). \n \nJEFFREY KLEIN (President and CEO, Nevada Senior Services): \nOften, through personal experiences, we appreciate the impact of the healthcare \ndelivery  system  and  challenges  it  presents  to  some  of  our  most  vulnerable \nsenior citizens and individuals with disabilities. I have submitted my supporting \ntestimony and presentation for A.B. 344 (Exhibit C). \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIt sounds like this was an amazing project with good work and results. If we \nwere able to do the pilot project, what is missing that requires a change to \nNevada Revised Statutes (NRS)? \n \nJEFFREY DUNCAN (Social Services Chief, Aging and Disability Services Division, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nFormalizing this service in statute shows Nevada's commitment to a partnership \nbetween  health  care  and  social  services.  This  step  could  help  us  be  more \ncompetitive in discretionary grant opportunities. It also gives us the flexibility to \nsee if there are other resources of funding to grow services such as third-party \npayers. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nSection 1, subsection 2, paragraph (c) states \"use other options available to \nfund  the  program,  including,  without  limitation,  billing  third  parties  for  the \nservices  provided  by  the  program  to  persons  currently  covered  by  the \nthird parties.\" Section 1, subsection 3, paragraph (c), subparagraph (2) states \n\"'Third party' means: A health benefit plan, as defined in NRS 687B.470, for \nemployees which provides coverage for services and care at a hospital.\" Could \ninsurance companies be billed for this without limitation, or is this something \nalready covered in the insurance plan a patient would have? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 27, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nMR. KLEIN: \nA number of insurances do pay for different types of care transitions. Some of \nthe components of the care transitions programs are individually billable. For \ninstance, a respite coach may be billable as a person-care service. The social \nwork or counseling components could also be billed. There are insurances that \npay for care transitions. Self-insured insurance companies frequently pay for \ncare transitions and approve those payments. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThis would not be adding a burden to insurance companies already covering this \nservice? \n \nMR. KLEIN: \nCorrect. It would, however, potentially encourage changes making the process \nmuch  less  difficult  and  challenging  because  of  some  of  the  impediments \nsometimes seen in regulations. \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nIn the pilot, you are talking about hospital to home. Is there going to be any \ncollaboration  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA)  and  the \nservices in terms of transportation? \n \nMR. KLEIN: \nWe  have  been  working  in  both  pilot  programs  to  coordinate  transportation \nthrough  the  Aging  and  Disability  Services  Division.  In  some  instances,  we \ncoordinate with family caregivers for private transportation. In all cases, we \nprovide  a  mechanism  for  coordinated  transportation  resources  by  the  case \nmanagers to make sure people have access to everything they need, including \nfood, medications, doctor appointments and any other follow-up care. \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nIf there is any opportunity for collaboration, it will stretch the dollars further. I \nknow the VA has individual rides and bus-providing services. There may be \nthings during this pilot the VA is doing or knows about which civilians are \nunaware. Some of the hospitals have been strained due to Covid-19. There is an \nopportunity for collaboration. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 27, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nI read there is a 25 percent, under 30-day readmission. At one time, the Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services would not pay if the readmission was under \n30 days. How are you getting around that? \n \nMR. KLEIN: \nWe have had welcome arms from the hospitals. They have been partners on this \nfrom Day 1. The original hurdle you refer to about readmissions has changed \ndramatically. This is a development for the hospitals, which is why we have \nstrong support from them. We are actively working with ten hospitals in the \nState, including Clark County. It has been a welcome change, especially toward \nthis population which is considered high risk. These frail people are likely to \nconsume  resources  if  they  get  back  into  the  hospital.  They  start  bouncing \nbetween postacute and acute and going back and forth.  \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nYou mentioned dementia and Alzheimer's diseases. In this pilot program, will \nAlzheimer's, dementia and other rare forms of dementia such as early Lewy \nbody dementia be included? \n \nMR. KLEIN: \nWhen we started this pilot program, we tried to limit it to people who had a \ndefined dementia diagnosis or were self-identified. As the program progressed, \nit  widened  out  to  cognitive  impairment.  The  program  is  quite  broad.  It \nencompasses not only Lewy body dementia and frontal lobe dementia but also \nvascular dementias.  People forget those who have had strokes do not fully \nrecover and end up with an expressive or receptive aphasia. While not having \ndementia in the classical sense, they have the effect of a cognitive impairment. \nThe impact of case management is the same. The program has widened out \ndiagnostically, making it easier for hospitals to manage instead of figuring out if \nthis person fits into the grant slot. We went from narrow in the beginning to \nwide these days. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN THOMAS: \nWe ask the Committee to consider this viable program for our elder community \nand people with disabilities who are asking for our assistance by voting this out \nof Committee to a Floor Session. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 27, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nBARRY GOLD (AARP): \nWe support A.B. 344. In 2015, the Nevada Legislature passed S.B. No. 177 of \nthe  78th  Session,  known  as  the  Care  Act,  to  assist  and  support  family \ncaregivers. It was the first step in providing information and notification to a \ncaregiver that a patient was to be discharged from the hospital and what to do \nwhen he or she got home. It did not involve any wraparound services to help \nthe patient once home or to help that person stay home. This bill is a next and \nnecessary step. We need to get this done to prevent people from going back to \nthe hospital where they do not want to be or to spend more money. \n \nMARY LIVERATTI (AARP): \nI  support  A.B.  344.  I  am  a  volunteer  with  AARP  and  the  Alzheimer's \nAssociation. People are being discharged from hospitals with complicated and \ncomplex health conditions. My sister and I took care our aunt and father after \nmany hospital discharges. My sister has been a nurse over 35 years, and I was \na social worker for 40 years. We were a great team. On one occasion, my \nfather  was  discharged  with  a  complicated  wound  care,  and  it  took  several \nweeks  for  us  to  get  it  under  control.  Even  with  our  knowledge  of  health \nsystems, we saw how hard it was to care for and keep on top of their health \nafter discharge. I cannot imagine what families do who do not have access to \nthis kind of expertise. I urge you to pass A.B. 344. \n \nGILLIAN BLOCK (Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers): \nWe support A.B. 344. We encourage increasing opportunities for cooperation \nbetween hospitals and caregivers to coordinate health care and social services \nfor older persons and persons with disabilities. Care coordination programs can \nhelp  improve  continuity  of  care,  improve  outcomes  and  provide  a  smooth \ntransition for those who are in need of ongoing support. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will now close the hearing on A.B. 344. I will open the hearing on A.B. 138. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 138 (1st Reprint): Revises provisions governing the eligibility of \ncertain convicted persons for public assistance. (BDR 38-760) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN SUSIE MARTINEZ (Assembly District No. 12): \nI am presenting A.B. 138 which revises provisions governing the eligibility of \ncertain convicted persons for public assistance. I have submitted my written \nremarks (Exhibit D). \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 27, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nSHANE PICCININI (Food Bank of Northern Nevada): \nI  will  present  A.B.  138  and  have  submitted  written  testimony  (Exhibit  E). \nDiscussion will include the historical background of the Temporary Assistance \nfor Needy Families (TANF) program and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance \nProgram (SNAP). I will discuss what A.B. 138 intends to accomplish (Exhibit F). \nAlso submitted is information about the SNAP (Exhibit G).  \n \nThis bill removes the prohibition in Nevada law to allow individuals impacted by \nsubstance abuse felonies to get access to SNAP and TANF, which is one of the \nlast barriers facing people in need of food assistance. Recovery does not happen \nin a vacuum, it happens in a community. This bill is designed to bring people \nback into the community. \n \nANNETTE MAGNUS (Executive Director, Battle Born Progress): \nWe support A.B. 138. The ban this legislation will remedy negatively impacts \npublic  health.  The  ban  promotes  food  insecurity  and  malnutrition  for \nex-offenders  and  their  families.  It  poses  a  barrier  for  reintegration  into  the \ncommunity  and  has  a  disparate  impact  on  African  Americans,  women  and \nsurvivors of domestic violence. From July 2019 through December 2020, over \n3,800  individuals  in  Nevada  have  been  disqualified  from  SNAP  due  to  this.  \nThousands of families going hungry is unacceptable. The ban is a cruel policy, \nand we need to change this. \n \nNICK SHEPACK (American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada):  \nWe support A.B. 138. The policy, as it stands, is one of the most illogical \npolicies we know of in this State. For people to succeed and get off drugs, they \nneed their hierarchy of needs met, as Maslow would say, and the first need is \nfood and shelter. The chance for people to get to higher levels and self-actualize \nto become meaningful members of society is significantly more difficult. The \ncurrent policy talks about one felony. It is not felonies related to drugs, it has to \nbe a drug felony, which can even be for possession. It can be for a person who \nis not addicted to drugs but, nonetheless, has to complete a 30-day substance \nabuse program. There are not many drug addiction programs available. We had \nan average of less than one bed available in northern Nevada. Existing law does \nnot  make  sense  and  criminalizes  people  beyond  paying  their  dues  and \ndisproportionately affects people of color, especially Black single mothers who \nhave a difficult time supporting their children and often lose their children. This \nis a commonsense bill, and we urge you to support it. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 27, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nBEN INESS (Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada): \nWe support A.B. 138. Food insecurity and malnutrition for a person with a \nfelony drug conviction pose a barrier to reintegration into the community. It also \nhas a disproportionate impact on people of color who are unjustly targeted in \nthe war on drugs. Nearly 80 percent of people in federal prison and 60 percent \nof people in State prison for drug offenses are Black or Latino. Limiting access \nto food for someone in their family is a cruel way to encourage treatment. \n \nASHANTI LEWIS (Three Square Food Bank): \nWe support A.B. 138. Federal nutrition programs such as SNAP should be made \navailable  to  all  eligible  applicants,  especially  applicants  from  vulnerable \npopulations who are essentially shut out of housing options and have extremely \nlimited  employment  opportunities.  Removing  this  barrier  will  reduce  food \ninsecurity while helping people recover and successfully reintegrate back into \nsociety. \n \nSERENA EVANS (Nevada Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual Violence): \nWe support A.B. 138. Access to social services such as SNAP and TANF has a \npositive effect on victim survivors of violence and can be the key for them to \nleave and end an abusive relationship. Without these social service programs \nwhich allow victim survivors to care for their children, victims are more likely to \nstay in an abusive relationship and endure violence. Having access to social \nservices is an effective tool in reducing risk factors for future violence. Within \nany  community,  victim  survivors  of  violence  can  have  convictions  of  drug \nabuse, and they are just as deserving of social support. We appreciate this bill \nwill reduce barriers and enable access to SNAP and TANF benefits. Everyone \ndeserves access to food and to these life-saving programs. \n \nMS. BLOCK:  \nNevada  Coalition  of  Legal  Service  Providers  supports  A.B.  138.  I  echo  the \nremarks of previous speakers. \n \nKENDRA BERTSCHY (Deputy Public Defender, Washoe County Public Defender's \nOffice): \nWe support A.B. 138. I am testifying on behalf of the Public Defender Offices in \nWashoe and Clark Counties. This bill will help reduce recidivism and allow our \nclients to have access to services and resources to assist in their recovery. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 27, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe hearing on A.B. 138 is now closed. I will open the hearing on A.B. 430. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 430: Revises provisions relating to disabilities. (BDR 39-1048) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN TRACY BROWN-MAY (Assembly District No. 42): \nI am presenting A.B. 430. This bill is necessary and easy to move forward. \nNevada  Revised  Statutes  has  some  negative  terminology,  which  can  be \neliminated.  Chapter  435  of  NRS  relates  to  individuals  with  intellectual  or \ndevelopmental  disabilities.  The  focus  of  the  bill  is  to  remove  outdated  and \noffensive  language.  Specifically,  this  bill  removes  a  reference  to  a  State \nAssociation for Retarded Citizens which no longer exists in Nevada. \n \nJESSICA ADAMS (Deputy Administrator, Aging and Disability Services Division, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nAssembly Bill 430 revises certain terms and removes related obsolete terms \nexisting within NRS 435. Section 1 replaces obsolete language with \"reside in \nan  appropriate  community-based  setting  that  is  not  a  facility.\"  Section  2 \nremoves the obsolete references to the State Association for Retarded Citizens \nand its board as this organization no longer exists in Nevada. Fee schedules \nestablished by the Administrator of the Aging and Disability Services Division \nare subject to the approval of the Department of Health and Human Services \nDirector.  Section  3  updates  the  legislative  intent  for  jobs  in  day-training \nservices. This will change the purpose of jobs in day-training services for people \nwith intellectual and developmental disabilities by changing the phrase \"help \nthem become useful citizens\" to \"increase independence.\" This bill has no fiscal \nnote. These changes align with the terms and phrases used daily and represent \nterminology used in the field, as well as respectful language deserved by the \npeople we serve. \n \nPATRICIA  (ACE  PATRICK)  UNRUH  (Chair,  Nevada  Statewide  Independent  Living \nCouncil): \nSince the late 1960s, there has been an evolving movement toward person-first \nlanguage. It originated in Sweden and began to be incorporated in the U.S. with \nhistorical acts within our Constitution. Now it is the accepted terminology of the \nAmerican Psychological Association and further translates into most government \nacts  such  as  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  and  the  Individuals  with \nDisabilities Education Act. It only makes sense Nevada ensures our language in \nstatutes follow suit. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 27, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nThe  purpose  behind  person-first  language  is  to  emphasize  the  individuality, \nequality  and  dignity  of  people  with  disabilities  and  maintain  individuals  are \npeople first and foremost. People's traits and medical conditions do not define \nwho  they  are  but  rather  are  a  trait  or  medical  condition.  Using  person-first \nlanguage reduces social stigmas and provides a reference that places all people \nin the same category before introducing any other aspects to be considered. \nAlthough  not  every  person  agrees  with  person-first  language,  it  generally \ninvolves  mutual  respect  and  is  appreciated  by  the  majority  of  the  disability \ncommunity. This bill supports person-first and respectful language options for \npeople  with  disabilities.  The  most  important  thing  to  remember  when \nconsidering  person-first  language  is  it  replaces  antiquated  and  offensive \nterminology that has no business in Nevada language. Words do matter. \n \nIn my experience, I can testify that for years I felt like a farm animal being \nherded by doctors, psychiatrists and institutions. They used my diagnosis as \nlabels to push me through to the next provider. These professionals did not start \nto see me as a person until the paradigm changed. Suddenly, I became a person \nwith autism, a person with hearing loss, a person with blindness, a person with \na neurological disorder. My life changed dramatically when professionals began \nto  address  me  about  my  diagnosis  and  not  talk  to  each  other  about  my \ndiagnosis as if I did not exist. It may not seem like it matters to people who \nhave never had to remind others we are in the room, but I can tell you it has \nmade  an  enormous  impact  on  the  quality  of  my  life.  I  am  a  person  with \ndisabilities. \n \nLISA FOSTER (State of Nevada Association of Providers): \nWe support A.B. 430. We partner with the State to provide supportive living \narrangements, jobs and day-training services, and related supportive programs \nthroughout Nevada. This bill moves statute language into the modern vernacular \nfor  individuals  with  intellectual  disabilities  and  brings  Nevada  into  better \nalignment with federal terminology. In section 1, the term used to describe the \ntransition of persons residing in such a facility is being revised to \"appropriate \ncommunity-based setting.\" This is what we now have and what our providers \nand  SNAP  offer  in  partnership  with  the  State;  SNAP  also  appreciates  the \nremoval of obsolete language in section 2 of the bill. Lastly, we support the \nchange in section 3 as it pertains to the goal of the services offered by the \nState  and  its  direct  providers  to  the  term  \"increase  independence.\"  Current \nlanguage is antiquated and not respectful. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 27, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nEDWARD ABLESER (Opportunity Village): \nWe support A.B. 430. The proposed language is moving forward and advancing \nthe causes for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. It also \narticulates  the  demanding  need  for  those  individuals  to  find  and  reside  in \nappropriate community-based settings. We have seen detrimental effects over \nmany  years  that  facilities  are  not  the  place  for  individuals  to  find  a \nperson-centered, meaningful day experience within their day-to-day lives. \n \nDORALEE MARTINEZ (Nevada Action Coalition): \nWe support A.B. 430. We ditto the remarks of the previous callers. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 430 and open the hearing on A.B. 197. \n \nASSEMBLY  BILL  197  (1st  Reprint):  Revises  provisions  relating  to  persons \nexperiencing homelessness. (BDR 11-682) \n \nASSEMBLYMAN HOWARD WATTS (Assembly District No. 15): \nYouth homelessness is a crisis in Nevada. With me today to present this bill are \nArash Ghafoori and Tayvon Jenkins with the Nevada Partnership for Homeless \nYouth (NPHY). I will provide a brief overview of the bill and have submitted my \nwritten remarks (Exhibit H). \n \nARASH GHAFOORI (Executive Director, Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth): \nNevada has one of the highest rates of unaccompanied youth homelessness in \nthe  Country.  Consequently,  increasing  access  to  health  care  for  minors \nexperiencing  homelessness  is  paramount  to  the  health  of  vulnerable  young \npeople  and  the  wellness  of  our  entire  State.  I  have  submitted  my  written \ntestimony (Exhibit I). \n \nTAYVON JENKINS (Youth Ambassador, Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth): \nI was born in Compton, California, and am the eldest of six children. I am a \ngraduate  of  NPHY's  Independent  Living  Program  and  an  official  Youth \nAmbassador. When I was 12 years old, I experienced homelessness for the \nfirst time with my family. After that, my homelessness was off and on due to \nconflict  within  my  family  and  my  mother's  health  problems.  My  written \ntestimony (Exhibit J) has been submitted. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 27, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWhat is the definition of a custodian? \n \nASSEMBLYMAN WATTS: \nThis language came about in conversations with Clark County. When youth \nenter the State and local government systems, these entities are technically not \nguardians  for  the  youth  but  custodians.  This  is  the  definition  referenced  in \nstatute and in the amendment we incorporated in the Assembly. The goal was \nto  include  every  type  of  relationship  between  youth  and  the  caretaker.  It \nincludes parents, guardians and now custodians in those referenced sections. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nOverall, I noticed the bill does everything to protect the caregiver and child. \nSection  1,  paragraph  5  states  \"a  minor  may  not  consent  to  his  or  her \nsterilization.\" It does not address the obviously technical issue of abortion. The \nhomeless child is able to consent to her own abortion, is this correct? \n \nASSEMBLYMAN WATTS: \nLegal opinion was requested about this in the Assembly. I can send the analysis \nto all of you since I do not have it in front of me. Our parental notification laws \non the books are unconstitutional. There is currently no consent requirement. \nThis bill does nothing to move that backward or forward in any way. The bill is \nsilent on this issue partly because other statutes are on the books. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nPlease distribute the legal analysis to the Committee as it will be helpful. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nIf there were a requirement for the NPHY child to get permission from the \nparents, how easy or difficult might it be? I am thinking about the testimony \ngiven by Mr. Jenkins. I am asking if it is feasible. \n \nASSEMBLYMAN WATTS: \nI will turn it over to Mr. Ghafoori to speak to some of the logistical hurdles and \nissues  homeless  youth  experience.  All  we  have  is  a  requirement  stating \nunaccompanied youth must be homeless for four months to access care. We do \nnot provide any guidance on how a provider would make the determination \nbefore rendering care. The whole point of this bill is to take away that time \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 27, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nbarrier and to lay out a clear process to assist both service providers as well as \nhealthcare providers to ensure minors get access to the care they need. \n \nMR. GHAFOORI: \nThere are definitely barriers for youth experiencing homelessness and accessing \nmedical care. With this law, we are introducing a third-party verification we \nhave  used  since  allowed  in  2008,  as  well  as  public  schools  and  other \norganizations in our State, allowing us to easily verify two medical providers. \nThe issue occurs when unaccompanied youth experience medical situations—it \nis difficult for medical providers to honor and accept the law and treat these \nyouth.  Often,  medical  providers  are  afraid  to  do  so  for  fear  of  liability. \nTherefore, this bill cleans this up by adding a third-party verification because \nthat is usually where the issue lies. \n \nYouth accessing care when they are unaccompanied and homeless is a huge \nproblem. We constantly work with the community doing outreach to get youth \nconnected to social workers and case managers. We can advocate and get them \npsychosocial well-being, complete holistic health overview and assessment. We \nalso  help  youth  connect  to  those  resources.  Assembly  Bill 197  will  help \norganizations like ours do this more easily, while also allowing medical providers \nto have a very black-and-white way of verification. This is why the Nevada \nHospital Association is excited and supports A.B. 197. \n \nASSEMBLYMAN WATTS: \nMany situations lead youth to become homeless and unaccompanied. Many, but \nnot all, have left a home environment that was dangerous or unstable. Some \nhave been kicked out of their homes. In either of those situations, even for the \nmost basic medical care, getting in contact with a parent to sign off on health \ncare can be incredibly difficult. We need to have a clear statutory framework \nallowing youth to access medical services without obtaining parental consent \nfirst. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nWhen children leave domestic violence situations, many times they are being \nmolested by parents. In recalling a case in Kentucky, an uncle was molesting a \nyoung  lady  and  she  was  trying  to  get  away  and  wanted  to  tell  someone. \nFour months later they found her in a barn. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 27, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nMS. MAGNUS: \nBattle Born Progress supports A.B. 197. Youth homelessness is a crisis we have \nto  deal  with  in  Nevada,  and  this  bill  is  a  good  step.  Making  it  easier  for \nunaccompanied homeless youth to access health care is crucial in ensuring their \nhealth and safety, especially during a global pandemic when people need health \nservices the most. Ensuring these young people's safety, health and privacy will \nallow our homeless youth to focus on their self-sufficiency and ensure they are \nstaying healthy. As someone who worked in reproductive health care for years, \nI must state it is not the business of the State or any politician to tell anyone \nwith a uterus what they can and cannot do with their health care. When young \npeople are homeless, there are usually serious reasons why, and it can put \nyoung people in danger if they interface with their parent or guardian. For all of \nthese  reasons  and  what  others  have  stated  today,  we  ask  you  to  support \nA.B. 197. \n \nMR. SHEPACK: \nAmerican  Civil  Liberties  Union  of  Nevada  supports  A.B.  197.  Mr.  Jenkins \nsummed it up well. This is an important bill. We need to do everything we can \nto  ensure  our  homeless  youth  have  access  to  all  the  things  they  need  to \nsucceed,  and  health  care  is  at  the  top.  This  bill  is  another  commonsense \nmeasure codifying a solid practice in the law to ensure youth who have faced \ntraumas, which many of us cannot imagine, have access to the health care they \nneed. \n \nPAMELA GIRGIS, APRN, PNP: \nI support A.B. 197. I am a pediatric nurse practitioner and medical provider for \nthe Children's Health Fund and Nevada Health mobile medical van. There are \nmany homeless, sex-trafficked and refugee children in Las Vegas. Since 2018, \nour team has been providing free health care to homeless youth, and we have \npartnered with NPHY. Many of the homeless youth we see on a weekly basis \nare unable to access healthcare services, including behavioral and mental health \nservices, due to restrictions. Many homeless youth have depression and have \nsurvived multiple traumas. They are at a 7.2 times higher risk for committing \nsuicide. Restricting access to care increases the risk of suicide and potential \nharm to these youth. The current restrictions often make youth unable to access \nspecialty  healthcare  services.  Our  team  has  repeatedly  seen  how  this  has \nnegatively  impacted  many  youth  in  need  of  medical  services.  There  are \ncountless stories of the need to treat depression, asthma, diabetes and other \nconditions. This bill will provide youth with hope and a new lease on life. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 27, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nDASHUN JACKSON (Children's Advocacy Alliance): \nWe  support  A.B.  197.  This  bill  is  essential  to  ensure  that  homeless  youth \nreceive the services they so desperately need. \n \nKATIE RYAN (Dignity Health-St. Rose Dominican): \nWe  support  A.B.  197.  We  are  glad  the  oversight  will  be  remedied  by  the \npassage of this bill. \n \nLEANN  MCALLISTER  (Executive  Director,  Nevada  Chapter  of  the  American \nAcademy of Pediatrics): \nWe support A.B. 197. I have submitted our supporting testimony (Exhibit K). \n \nJOANNA JACOB (Clark County): \nWe support A.B. 197. \n \nPATRICIA JULIANELLE (SchoolHouse Connection): \nWe support A.B. 197. I have submitted our supporting testimony (Exhibit L). \n \nMELISSA CLEMENT (Executive Director, Nevada Right to Life): \nI support A.B. 197. I am testifying today as a parent. A parent's heart is broken \nevery time a child is in need. Our homeless youth need to have access to \nmedical procedures as quickly as they can. I encourage this Committee to keep \nparental rights in mind. Will the parent be impacted? Will the child who has a \nloving parent or guardian at home still have that loving adult involved? This is \nmy only concern with this measure. \n \nMARY FECHNER: \nI oppose A.B. 197. I am concerned about minor children who do not have a \nparent or faith relationship and go to a hospital pregnant, wanting to request an \nabortion. My concern for these young girls is that something be available to \nthem for counseling should this situation come up, rather than an immediate \nsituation where they send a young girl to an operating room because she has \nrequested it. I would hope the young children seeking help get counseling for \ntheir mental and physical situation prior to surgery. \n \nALEXIS  TUCEY  (Deputy  Administrator,  Division  of  Child  and  Family  Services, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nWe are testifying in neutral on A.B. 197. We appreciate everyone's support and \nworking through the amendments. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 27, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nASSEMBLYMAN WATTS: \nI distributed to the Committee members and staff the legal opinion related to the \nquestions  brought  up  previously.  In  response  to  the  opposition,  this  bill  is \nnarrowly tailored. The concept youth would somehow use this as a workaround \nwhen  they  have  loving,  supportive  parents  at  home  is  not  acceptable.  The \nstatutory language we have is more broad and vague than this bill about proving \nsomeone has been unaccompanied for four months. I direct all the opposition to \nread section 1, subsection 2 of A.B. 197. It is clear and precise in laying out \nhow youth would demonstrate they have been unaccompanied for four months. \nThe service providers and school staff assigned to homeless youth would help \nthem access this care without consent. This is not a bill about abortion. If there \nis a bill wanting to make a broad parental consent law constitutional, then we \ncan have that debate separately. This bill is about ensuring homeless youth who \nare unaccompanied in this State can get access they need.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI am closing the hearing on A.B. 197. I will now open the hearing on A.B. 399. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 399 (1st Reprint): Revises provisions governing the production \nand sale of eggs and egg products. (BDR 51-559) \n \nASSEMBLYMAN HOWARD WATTS (Assembly District No. 15): \nAssembly  Bill  399  seeks  to  ensure  eggs  produced  or  sold  in  Nevada  meet \ncertain standards of humane treatment for laying hens, often referred to as \ncage-free housing. I have submitted my written presentation (Exhibit M). \n \nWARREN HARDY (Humane Society of the United States): \nThis a happy occasion  when  we get the animal  welfare advocates and the \nindustry  together  to  move  forward  in  a  positive  direction.  This  bill  is  a \ncollaborative effort between the Humane Society of the United States and those \nwho provide egg production for the State. Since the Assembly hearing, we had \nconcerns raised from the Retail Association of Nevada, Chamber of Commerce \nand Nevada Restaurant Association regarding the need for a phased-in approach \nas adopted in the amendment. We addressed their concerns and gained the \nsupport of those organizations. We also had conversations with the Nevada \nCattlemen's  Association  and  Nevada  Farm  Bureau  relating  to  the  small  hen \nfarms and what we define as free-range chickens. We amended the bill with \nprovisions that do not apply to any farms with less than 3,000 hens. This \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 27, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nshould take care of all our small producers in Nevada who provide eggs at \ncounty fairs, farmers markets and those sort of venues. \n \nJEFF DIXON (Nevada State Director, Humane Society of the United States): \nI have submitted my written remarks (Exhibit N) and the proposed amendment \n(Exhibit O). \n \nJIM VAN GORKOM (Senior Vice President, NuCal Foods): \nI have submitted my written remarks (Exhibit P). \n \nJERRY WILKINS (Sales and Marketing Director, Morning Fresh Farms): \nI have submitted my written remarks (Exhibit Q). \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nNo fiscal note implies no significant increase in the need for inspections. Once \nwe have put this in place, how do we know how hens are being treated? \n \nASSEMBLYMAN WATTS: \nWe  worked  with  the  State  Department  of  Agriculture  in  crafting  this  bill, \nintegrating  this  into  existing  procedures  to  guarantee  food  safety,  including \neggs. Whether the producer is physically located here in Nevada or is bringing \nproducts into the State, a procedure is in place. Assembly Bill 399 adds a layer \nby adding an endorsement to the certification that the production of those eggs \nis cage-free. As for inspections, there are various options to have inspections \nprovided in reports to the Department of Agriculture as part of the process. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe earlier heard our State does not have in-State producers which explains why \nwe do not have a fiscal note. How does the interstate commerce piece work, \nand how do we know eggs coming from anywhere in the Country meet these \nstandards? \n \nASSEMBLYMAN WATTS: \nWe have to work within the existing process under the State Department of \nAgriculture.  It  can  be  integrated  into  the  workflow  with  a  number  of \ncertifications on an annual basis. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nHow do we know these eggs are humane when we get them here in Nevada? \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 27, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nMR. VAN GORKOM: \nThere  are  multiple  certifying  agencies  across  the  Country  used  by  egg \nproducers.  We  have  customers  who  require  different  types  of  audits.  The \nprocesses are already in place. For example, one organization called Humane \nFarm Animal Care certifies farms. This is just one of many organizations within \nthe  egg  industry  specifically  for  the  purpose  of  an  audit  trail  and  process \nverification. Any farmer in California or Massachusetts could supply his or her \ncertificate  to  the  State  Department  of  Agriculture  as  documentation  of \ncompliance. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nA lot of work has been done for labeling and public education. Are those the \nsame third-party certification bodies that enable egg producers to put a logo on \ntheir boxes stating the product is pasture-raised, organic or cage-free? Does this \nbill align with those labeling standards? \n \nMR. VAN GORKOM: \nYes.  There  are  many  egg  cartons  or  boxes  in  commerce  with  one  logo  or \nanother. In some cases, it would be the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) \ncertifying a product meets its national organic program requirements. There are \nUSDA definitions for most of these egg types, except for the word \"natural\" \nwhich is vague. These certifying companies and applicable logos, which are \noptional except for the USDA organic circle, could be a way for a consumer or \nbusiness to verify on the package that it meets these standards. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nIn A.B. 399, section 22 states \"Any person who violates any of the provisions \nof sections 1.3 to 22, inclusive, of this act is subject to a civil penalty pursuant \nto NRS 583.700.\" What is the civil penalty, and is it enough to be a deterrent? \n \nASSEMBLYMAN WATTS: \nI  need  to  ask  the  Legal  Division  to  advise  what  the  penalties  are  in  the \nreferenced section. In Chapter 583 of NRS, they are the same penalties for \nviolating  other  parts  of  our  agricultural  statutes,  so  it  is  in  line  with  those \npenalties. We wanted to make sure it was a civil penalty in line with many of \nour criminal justice reform efforts. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 27, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nERIC ROBBINS (Counsel): \nAccording to NRS 583.700, the first violation penalty would be $250, second \nviolation  penalty  would  be  $500,  and  each  subsequent  violation  would  be \n$1,000. \n \nMR. SHEPACK: \nThe  American  Civil  Liberties  Union  of  America  does  not  take  a  position  on \nA.B. 399. However, my big boss, my partner at home, and I both support this \nbill. As egg lovers and members of this fine State, knowing our eggs will always \nbe cage-free is something we look forward to with the passing of this bill. \n \nDOUG BUSSELMAN (Executive Vice President, Nevada Farm Bureau): \nWe oppose A.B. 399. We have been in conversations with Mr. Hardy and the \nHumane  Society  of  the  United  States,  and  they  have  shared  a  conceptual \namendment  with  us  to  provide  an  exemption  for  small  egg  producers.  The \nconversation  has  been  to  remove  the  requirements  from  the  bill  of  an  egg \nproducer who has 3,000 or fewer hens laying eggs. Our opposition has been \nbased on the impacts of Nevada's small backyard and small egg producers. As \nfar as we know, there are no commercial-sized egg producers in Nevada, and \nwe are not aware of any egg producers in the State that use laying cages. This \nlevel  of  3,000  hens  would  fit  the  needs  of  backyard  and  small  farmers  in \nNevada, and they would not be subject to what we view as a burdensome \nrequirement  for  certification.  The  addition  of  the  conceptual  amendment  to \nexempt Nevada egg producers that have 3,000 hens or less would cause us to \nno longer be in opposition to the bill. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIn the Senate and in this Committee, you may testify however you feel most \nauthentically regarding your position on this bill. Given the amendment, would \nyou like to be listed under opposition or support? \n \nMR. BUSSELMAN: \nWith the amendment, we would be in neutral. \n \nALEXANDRIA DAZLICH (Nevada Restaurant Association): \nWe are neutral on A.B. 399. We appreciate the intent of the bill; however, we \nhave concerns. It sets a precedent in mandating consumer choice as well as \nincreasing the price of a staple food. As you are aware, the restaurant industry \nhas been greatly devastated by the pandemic and will need time to recover as \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 27, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nwe continue to operate at limited capacity. Therefore, instituting this level of \nchange in the distribution and supply chain of a staple food will likely have \nnegative effects on our members. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWhat is an omega-3 egg? Is it a real thing, and does it have any higher nutrient \nvalue? \n \nMR. VAN GORKOM: \nYes, it is a real thing. Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown in studies to yield \nhealth benefits. These fatty acids can be added to chicken feed; the hen's body \nabsorbs it and passes along a certain amount into the egg itself. When you see \neggs listed with an omega-3 enhancement, it should also tell you a numerical \nvalue. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDoes this make an omega-3 egg and a pasture-raised egg mutually exclusive \nbecause it has to be done through feed? \n \nMR. VAN GORKOM: \nThey are not exclusive because even a pasture-raised egg is still given regular \nchicken feed to supplement its natural grass diet. Whether the egg is cage-free, \norganic or pasture-raised, theoretically the omega additive could be added to the \nfeed for any of those. \n \nASSEMBLYMAN WATTS: \nThank you, Chair Ratti, for your eggscellent questions! Many major restaurant \nchains  are  moving  in  this  direction,  and  major  gaming  companies  based  in \nNevada have already made this commitment. In listening to the stakeholders, \nwe did create a longer phase in the timeline allowing both the producers and \nthose who are obtaining eggs, especially in commercial enterprises, to do this in \na way that works and does not create any pain. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 399.

In \naddition, I will review the “Nevada County Age, Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin \nEstimates and Projections 2000 to 2038 Estimates from 2000 to 2017 and \nProjections from 2018 to 2038” (Exhibit F) and “The 2020 Census in Nevada \nSnapshot #7” (Exhibit G). \n \nExhibit G, available on the legislative website, shows the percentages of the \npopulations who speak English less than very well. The link on Exhibit G will \ntake you to the information. \n \nWe also have a conceptual amendment (Exhibit H). Nevada Revised Statutes \n(NRS) 639.2801  is  the  requirement  for  labeling  containers  for  prescription \ndrugs. This law has nine different components that comprise the label that is \nrequired to be on a prescription drug bottle. \n \nWe  are  asking  that  subsection  6  of  NRS  639.280,  which  is  the  “specific \ndirections  for  use  given  by  the  prescribing  practitioner,”  be  translated  into \nlanguages other than English, and this is what section 1, subsection 1 of the bill \ndoes. The amendment clarifies we are requesting specifically subsection 6. \n \nSection 1, subsection (2), paragraphs (a) and (b) ask for a sign to be posted in a \nconspicuous place in a pharmacy stating the patient has the right to request the \ninformation on the label be printed in a language they speak. A list of languages \nwill be available for them to choose from. \n \nThe State Board of Pharmacy will adopt regulations to carry out the sections of \nthe bill. I referenced the demographers and the U.S. Census Bureau information \nin  my  written  remarks  to  promote  a  good  conversation  among  the  Board \nmembers to say what languages will be translated and what makes the most \nsense for our State. It makes sense to do it county by county, otherwise every \ncounty will have to translate to the Clark County standard. If you are a national \npharmacy doing a lot of programing, it may make sense to set yourself to that \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nhigher standard. If you are only operating in one county, the Board has the \nability to look at each county’s demographics and decide the languages that are \nappropriate for translation. \n \nItem 1 of the conceptual amendment will restore section 1, subsection 5 from \nA.B. 177 as introduced. This is the language regarding liability protections for \npharmacies that use third-party translation services. \n \nWe are asking for additional time for implementation from January 1, 2022, to \nJuly 1, 2022. This will give the time necessary to get the pharmacies ready to \nprovide the translation services. \n \nI have worked in the healthcare sector for a decade and know the difference of \nbeing  in  a  clinical  setting  where  you  have  access  to  translation  services \n24 hours a day. On the back of your badge, you have the number for your \ntranslation  service  when  you  need  to  communicate  with  someone  in  the \nhospital. You would call the number on your badge and have your conversations \ntranslated; this has become a good practice. \n \nWhen you go to a home-based environment, that support goes away. When \npeople  go  to  pick  up  their  medications  and  take  them  into  the  home \nenvironment, they are left without the ability to know what is in the bottle and \nhow to take it. This is why I am asking for this bill to be considered by the \nCommittee. \n \nI have left many homes nervous about a family’s ability to understand what is in \nthose  bottles.  There  are  oftentimes  opioids,  strong  drugs,  fentanyl  patches, \nlorazepam  and  morphine  that  are  prescribed,  and  you  hope  the  family  is \ncommunicating about what is in those bottles and how to take the medication. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThere was an amendment submitted earlier that had only one section and we \nreceived a second amendment, Exhibit H. Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson \nreviewed the additional amendment with us, and this is the correct amendment \nto the bill. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nAre you suggesting the insertion of subsection 6 of NRS 639.2801 so the only \npiece of information required to be translated is the instructions on the label on \nhow to take the medication? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN BENITEZ-THOMPSON: \nThat is correct. We had conversations about the relevant pieces of the label to \nbe translated which would be the instructions on how to take the medication. \nFor  instance,  take  twice  a  day,  three  times  a  day,  morning  and  evening. \nInformation  such  as  the  prescription  serial  number  would  not  need  to  be \ntranslated because they are not as relevant to the patient. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThere are pharmacies who are now providing translation services. Will this be \nenough, or are you requiring any and all languages translated on prescription \nlabels? As a physician, we are required to have a translation service which does \nnot  include  a  family  member.  Are  there  any  other  boards  that  require  this \ninformation in writing? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN BENITEZ-THOMPSON: \nIn the pharmacy setting, pharmacists are required to have verbal translation \nservices for communication purposes. This bill takes over once a person leaves \na pharmacy. The label will have the instructions on how to take the medication \nin  English  and  translated  into  the  language  of  the  person  for  whom  the \nmedication was prescribed. \n \nSenator Hardy, were you asking if there are other licensing boards in the State \nor other pharmacy boards in the Nation requiring translation services? \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nLicensing boards, please. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN BENITEZ-THOMPSON: \nThere  are  no  other  licensing  boards  in  the  State  that  require  the  ability  to \ntranslate. There are other boards nationwide that have the requirement; one is \nOregon.  We  learned  a  lot  from  the  bill  in  Oregon,  but  our  bill  has  taken  a \ndifferent path. California has done it differently, placing the responsibility on \ntheir board. It  has  been a less successful model having the board  translate \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nversus  the  pharmacy.  There  may  be  one  or  two  on  the  municipal  level  in \nNew York that have required the translation of the label. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI have not heard of a physician’s office requiring translated conversations with \npatients. Would this be different in that it would be printed information, not only \ntranslated verbally? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN BENITEZ-THOMPSON: \nThe prescription label only will be required for a written translation. Section 1, \nsubsection (1) of the bill states “upon the request” of the person who can \nrequest the translation from the pharmacy. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWill pharmacies that have a translation service posted have to figure out how to \nprint a label in a different language? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN BENITEZ-THOMPSON: \nThe  translation  services  the  pharmacy  has  are  specific  to  the  employees \ntranslating  to  a  patient  when  they  pick  up  their  medications.  There  is \none pharmacy that has a customer service number you can call, but you need to \nhave an intermediary. When you have someone who is not English proficient \ncalling a number that is English-based, you do not have the intermediary for that \ntranslation to happen. That would not be considered meeting the intent of the \nbill. The intent is the written piece on the label. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nDemographics are important. We have 25 percent to 35 percent of the world \nspeaking more than one language. It is unique to this Country that we require \none language throughout elementary, middle and high school. I can see the \nmerits in this bill. \n \nKATE BALLARD: \nI am a registered nurse in Oregon. I was one of the primary advocates for a \nsimilar Oregon bill, Senate Bill 698 of the Oregon 2019 Regular Session which \npassed and went into effect January 2021. \n \nThe Oregon law came about after nursing students working with patients with \nlimited English proficiency (LEP) noticed a high rate of medication error among \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nthis population. There was a highly educated mother from the Middle East who \nspoke multiple languages: English was not one of them. She could not read the \nlabels on her child’s inhalers and was unintentionally giving him the incorrect \ninhaler  during  an  acute  asthma  attack.  This  child  was  hospitalized  for \nlife-threatening asthma attacks that were unknowingly going untreated. \n \nAfter  this  bill  was  introduced  to  the  Oregon  Legislature,  there  was  an \noutpouring of support. This commonsense legislation resonated with health care \nprofessionals, community organizations and private citizens. The bill was passed \nout of the Senate and House Committees with unanimous bipartisan support. \n \nIn one physician’s testimony, he said “the only difference between a medicine \nand poison is understanding how to use it.” \n \nCurrent  practices  are  not  enough.  Language  services  among  pharmacies  are \nvariable and most do not provide any translated written materials. It is important \nto note that verbal interpretation alone is not enough. It is not realistic to expect \na patient to memorize the instructions for multiple medications after a single \nreview session at a pharmacy counter. \n \nPeer  reviewed  studies  and  legislative  testimony  document  the  danger  of \nproviding patients with English only prescription labels. Patients with LEP are \ntwice as likely to experience medication errors than English speaking patients. In \na study that tested the use of optimized translated prescription labels, patients \nwith LEP taking multiple drugs per day were significantly more likely to take the \ncorrect dosages when provided with these labels. \n \nCase  studies  have  also  documented  medication  errors.  An  infant  was \nhospitalized after her parents, who could not read the English instructions, gave \nher  12  times  the  intended  dose  of  liquid  iron.  A  survey  of  120  Wisconsin \npharmacies published by the American Academy of Pediatrics show more than \nhalf  reported  never,  or  sometimes,  providing  translated  prescription  labels. \nApproximately  two-thirds  of  the  pharmacies  reported  never,  or  sometimes, \ncommunicating verbally with patients with LEP. \n \nWhat do we need to understand about the cost of compliance? A large portion \nof the cost projected by chain pharmacies are front-loaded costs to integrate the \ntranslation  software  into  their  complex  systems.  Since  the  passage  of \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nNew York’s law in 2012, followed by California and Oregon, chain pharmacies \nhave had the time and legal imperative to integrate their translation software. \n \nCost to pharmacies will vary depending on their size and the software they \nhave.  It  cost  one  large  hospital  system  in  Oregon  $25,000  to  translate \n1,000 instructions into 14 languages. \n \nIn analyzing the financial impacts of A.B. 177, it is important to consider the \nsignificant  cost  savings  this  bill  would  bring.  The  average  cost  of  a  single \nhospitalization for a medication error is $15,000, which totals in the billions of \ndollars nationally each year. We do not know what percentage of those billions \nof  dollars  are  related  to  language  barriers  because  those  numbers  are  not \ntracked.  However,  experts  on  healthcare  economics  agree  that  costs  from \nlanguage-related medication errors will continue to increase over time unless \nhealthcare providers meet demands for improved translation services. \n \nHow do we know translated prescription labels are safe? Certified translation \ncompanies  use  a  rigorous  multi-step  vetting  process  in  their  translation  of \nprescription labels. The risk of a medication error is far lower than sending an \nLEP patient home with a bottle in English they cannot read or understand. \n \nWhy is it important to have both English and the translated language on the \nlabel?  Dual  language  labels  ensure  both  patients  with  LEP  and  their  English \nspeaking pharmacist, caregivers and providers know what the prescription label \nsays.  An  example  of  the  label  would  have  the  instructional  phrase  “take \none tablet by mouth daily” and would be translated. Both the English and the \ntranslation would be on the label. \n \nWill there be enough space on the bottle for both languages? In most situations, \nyes. However, there are several options to address uncommon instances where \nextra room is needed, including pull-out tabs or folding a second label in half and \nplacing  it  on  the  bottle.  This  is  a  common  practice  pharmacies  use  called \n“flagging.” \n \nWhy is it not sufficient to give a patient the translation on a separate piece of \npaper, rather than on the label? The reality is that many patients have upwards \nof  five  medications,  plus  children  with  medications  of  their  own.  It  is  not \nrealistic to expect a patient to keep track of five plus instruction packets and \nthen match the correct packet with the correct medication. If the translated \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \ninstructions are not on the bottle, the safety of Nevadans will continue to be at \nrisk. \n \nWhat  has  Oregon  learned  since  the  passage  of  its  law?  The  effective  date \nwritten in the law was January 2, 2021. The pandemic hit and everything froze. \nPharmacies  are  in  an  informal  grace  period  to  account  for  pandemic-related \ndelays. Until the Board of Pharmacy can safely resume inspections, we do not \nhave data on overall compliance; however, we do know that many pharmacies \nare having early success with this law. \n \nPharmacists have a code of ethics that requires them to communicate with \npatients in terms that are understandable and to respect personal and cultural \ndifferences among patients. Assembly Bill 177 enables pharmacists to meet \ntheir ethical requirements. \n \nBARRY GOLD (AARP): \nLifesaving prescription drugs do not work if you cannot afford them. Equally, \nyou can say lifesaving prescription drugs do not work if you do not know how \nto take them. People and their families need to understand how to take the \nmedicine they are prescribed to have positive health outcomes. For example, are \nyou supposed to take one of these once a day or two of these four times a day? \nThis is a big difference that would change the outcome. For these reasons, and \nthe fact that this is a simple solution to a big problem, AARP supports A.B. 177. \n \nERIC JENG (Asian Community Development Council): \nI will read from the written testimony provided by Carlo Miciano (Exhibit I) in \nsupport of A.B. 177. \n \nJOY AVENDANO (Asian Community Development Council): \nThere  are  68,000  LEP  households  across  the  State.  The  Asian  Community \nDevelopment Council is a partner of Nevada Health Link, and we have bilingual \nstaff in Tagalog, Vietnamese, Chinese, Spanish and Korean. Members of the \nFilipino  community  prefer  reaching  out  to  Filipino  doctors.  It  is  difficult  to \nunderstand some grammar in medical terms. Having English and Filipino printed \non  the  label  of  the  bottle  would  be  beneficial  since  many  Filipinos  have \nhouseholds with English and mixed language proficiency. The availability of both \nlanguages would mean Filipinos could easily double-check instructions and will \nnot need to keep booklets provided with the medication which can get lost. \nTheir confidence when navigating medical terms will increase. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nMAYA HOLMES (Culinary Health Fund): \nThe Culinary Health Fund is a nonprofit labor management trust that provides \nhealth  benefits  for  60,000  culinary  union  workers  and  their  dependents; \napproximately 125,000 lives. We operate two free pharmacies for our members \nand their dependents. One is located across from the Stratosphere Hotel, and \nthe other is at the intersection of Nellis and Lamb in Las Vegas. Our culinary \nhealth  center  is  within  a  five-mile  radius  of  approximately  40,000  of  our \nmembers. The membership of the culinary union is diverse and members hail \nfrom all corners of the globe. \n \nOur priority is ensuring access to high-quality affordable care in Nevada. Over \nthe years, we have worked on many pieces of legislation to address the high \ncost of prescription drugs and access to those drugs. Our pharmacies are part of \nthat  effort.  We  call  them  free  pharmacies  because  at  our  pharmacies  our \nmembers  have no copays for their prescriptions. Our nonprofit pharmacy at \nNellis is one of the busiest in the State having sold over 30,000 prescriptions in \nMarch. \n \nWe  support  A.B.  177  and  appreciate  Assemblywoman  Benitez-Thompson’s \nwork with us to address our concerns on the bill. We need to review the revised \nconceptual  amendment,  Exhibit  H,  regarding  the  focus  on  subsection  6  of \nNRS 639.2801 but believe this is an important piece of legislation that will \nensure patients have access to language translation for their prescriptions. \n \nELIZABETH MACMENAMIN (Retail Association of Nevada): \nThe Retail Association of Nevada supports A.B. 177. Because Nevada has such \na diverse population, this bill as amended, will create an added layer of safe \nmedication for LEP individuals and/or any patients in Nevada. Pharmacies and \npublic health officials have a strong history of reaching mutual public health \ngoals  together,  as  we  saw  during  the  recent  pandemic.  We  appreciate  the \nsponsor adding back the third-party liability to the language and protecting our \npharmacists going forward. We also appreciate limiting the translation of the \ndirections to use the medication, as this is the most important part on the \nprescription label. This will increase medication adherence. \n \nGILLIAN BLOCK (Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers): \nThe Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers supports A.B. 177 because we \nsupport  efforts  to  make  prescription  drug  labeling  more  accessible  to  the \ncommunity members we serve who oftentimes primarily speak a language other \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nthan  English.  This  bill  aligns  with  our  consumer  protection  goals  to  ensure \npeople have meaningful access to the important information needed to make \ncritical decisions and protect their health. \n \nCHRISTINE SAUNDERS (Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada): \nThe Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada supports Assembly Bill 177 as a \nsimple  solution  that  will  address  a  discriminatory  practice  leaving  many \nNevadans unprotected at a time when they are most vulnerable. It will provide \nvital steps to safeguard patients, reduce long-term costs and provide language \njustice for Nevadans. \n \nJOELLE GUTMAN DODSON (Washoe County Health District): \nThe Washoe County Health District supports A.B. 177. Prescription directions \nwritten in the proficient language for the prescribed patient is a patient-centered \nand public safety commonsense practice. Taking a prescription incorrectly due \nto LEP is dangerous and could be fatal. Additionally, medication administration \nmistakes can be an unnecessary cost to our healthcare system. \n \nLALO MONTOYA (Make the Road Nevada): \nMake the Road Nevada supports A.B. 177. We are a nonprofit organization that \ngives voices to immigrants and working-class Nevadans committed to organizing \ntomorrow’s  leaders  to  become  advocates  for  their  families.  We  feel  this  a \ncritical step to ensure healthcare parity for all Nevadans and brings the equity \nneeded for Nevadans with LEP. \n \nNevada has the highest per capita immigration population, which has nearly \ndoubled in the last 20 years. We have seen first-hand the diverse population of \nthe immigrant community hailing from Latin America, Asia, Europe and Africa. \nAccording to a new American economy of Nevada report, immigrants make up \n30  percent  of  entrepreneurs  in  Nevada,  with  immigrant  owned  businesses \ngenerating nearly $800 million in business, employing over 60,000 people. It is \nsafe to say that immigrants are an essential piece of the fabric of our State. \nAbout 250,000 LEP Nevadans speak Spanish as their first language and cannot \nread the directions for their prescription medication. \n \nAssembly  Bill  177  will  support  the  Latino  and  immigrant  communities  by \ntranslating their prescriptions into Spanish. As a young boy, I had to translate \nevery piece of documentation for my parents. As I got older, I realized no child \nshould have to bear that responsibility. No child should have to wing it, or \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nattempt  to  translate  a  critical  piece  of  information  like  medical  bills  or \nprescription  medications.  This  is  an  important  opportunity  to  advocate  for \nlanguage justice in Nevada. \n \nJAMIE COGBURN (Nevada Justice Association): \nIn principal, this bill is a good idea, but the Nevada Justice Association opposes \nA.B. 177.  We  have  a  concern  with  the  conceptual  amendment,  Exhibit H, \npresented this afternoon. It provides immunity to the pharmacy if the translation \nby the third party is not done correctly and may lead to medication errors. Our \nbiggest concern is who the translation company is. If it is a company out of \nChina, or India or another foreign country, or they are not insured; there is no \nramification or responsibility for anyone who has made an error. A pharmacy \ncan hire another company and have immunity, leaving the person who is hurt by \nthe negligence of the translation with no repercussions. \n \nMARIA-TERESA LIEBERMANN-PARRAGA (Battle Born Progress): \nBattle Born Progress supports A.B. 177. I grew up in a non-English speaking \nhousehold. This will help people like my mother, who is not as proficient in \nEnglish as I am. I found myself in situations when after surgery, I could not \nclearly understand what my prescriptions were. I needed to have a friend with \nme in case my mother did not understand. Not everyone has someone outside \nthe family who speaks English well enough to help out in situations such as \nthis. This will help everyone in a family who is not English proficient or has \nmixed proficiency. \n \nMELANIE KELLY (Safeway Pharmacy): \nI am a Nevada licensed pharmacist working in Sparks. I work for Albertsons \nCompanies  which  operate  36  pharmacies  in  Nevada  under  the  Albertsons, \nSafeway and Vons banner. Assembly Bill 177 addresses the needs of patients \nwith LEP; however, in its current state, it overlooks the needs of a pharmacist \nto be protected in the event errors occur in translation. Third-party companies, \nwith  the  translation  technology  and  expertise,  will  be  vital  in  ensuring  the \ndirections can be translated into the necessary language for the patient. As a \npharmacist, I will not be able to verify with certainty the translation is accurate, \nand will have to rely on the expertise of a third-party translation company. For \nthis  reason,  it  is  imperative  the  language  which  was  amended  out  of  the \nintroduced bill be added back into law. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nPlease consider adding back the language from subsection 5 to give pharmacists \nprotection  as  they  rely  on  third-party  companies  to  translate  the  directions \nwhich appear on the prescription label. This language reads: \n \nIf a pharmacy enters into a  contract  with a third party for the \ntranslation  of  the  information  that  the  pharmacy  is  required  to \nprovide pursuant to this section, the pharmacy and any employee \nof the pharmacy are not liable in any civil action for any injury \nresulting from the translation by the third party which is not the \nresult of negligence, recklessness or deliberate misconduct of the \npharmacy or employee. \n \nAdditionally, I would ask that the effective date of this law be changed to \none year after the Board of Pharmacy completes the rulemaking process. This \nwill ensure there is adequate time for necessary testing and implementation \nonce the full set of languages has been established. \n \nDORALEE MARTINEZ (Nevada Action Coalition): \nThe Nevada Action Coalition supports A.B. 177. \n \nPAUL MORADKHAN (Vegas Chamber): \nThe Vegas Chamber was originally opposed to A.B. 177. Based on the latest \nconceptual  amendment,  Exhibit  H,  the  Vegas  Chamber  is  now  neutral  on \nA.B. 177 because of the restoration of section 1, subsection 5, and change to \nthe implementation date. We are neutral now because of concerns about the \ncost to pharmacies. \n \nCYRUS HOJJATY: \nI appreciate the efforts to improve public health and the stability of individuals; \nhowever, I have some concerns. This brings the incentive that people will not \nlearn English. There are many private services, such as Google Translate, that \ncan help with translation. I am also concerned this will increase the cost of \ndoing business. \n \nThe  high  immigrant  population  mentioned  earlier  does  not  take  into \nconsideration that many people are not citizens and are here illegally. Why are \nwe having such population dynamics, and what benefits are we getting out of \nthis? How do we know these trends will continue? Being a minority does not \nmean you have LEP. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nNICK VANDER POEL (Reno + Sparks Chamber of Commerce): \nI echo the remarks made by my colleague from the Vegas Chamber in support \nof A.B. 177. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN BENITEZ-THOMPSON: \nI want to thank the pharmacists from the spectrum of pharmacy who took time \nto talk with me. It has been a long road but a road where there was dialogue \nand purposeful thought by everyone involved. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 177 and open the hearing on A.B. 181. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 181 (1st Reprint): Revises provisions relating to mental health. \n(BDR 40-522) \n \nWe  just  received  a  new  proposed  conceptual  amendment  (Exhibit  J)  from \nAssemblywoman Peters, with the purpose of clarifying the providers that must \nreport, and what data must be reported to the Chief Medical Officer. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN SARAH PETERS (Assembly District No. 24): \nThis bill came to me in two parts from separate parties with different interests. I \nsaw the potential to create what looked like a cornerstone of data collection in \nan underrepresented area of health care. \n \nThe first part of the bill deals with suicide data collection related to mental \nhealthcare  issues.  The  second  part  is  related  to  mental  health  parity.  The \npurpose  of  this  bill  is  to  focus  on  people;  the  patients  in  need  of  services \nprovided by both sides of this healthcare equation. \n \nThere is no one who can say that suicide is not a concern in Nevada. We have \nconsistently  been  identified  as  having  some  of  the  highest  rates  of  suicide \namong most demographics reported, including vulnerable populations such as \nveterans, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer youth and others. Data on \ncompleted suicides show we are too late with providing intervention services. \n \nThe  first  part  of  this  bill  proposes  collecting  data  prior  to  suicide  through \nattempts  at  identifying  people  and  patients  who  need  help  today. \nStephanie Woodard will go over the first part of the bill that was brought to me \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nby the Division of Public and Behavioral Health (DPBH) of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services (DHHS). \n \nSTEPHANIE WOODARD, Psy.D. (Senior Advisor on Behavioral Health, Division of \nPublic and Behavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services): \nWe have worked a long time, primarily on fatality data, recognizing the best \npractices supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \nand other national organizations that prioritize prevention of suicide. We need \nthe  data  to  understand  the  magnitude  of  the  issue  so  we  have  ample \nopportunity  to  intervene.  By  collecting  information  on  suicide  attempts  and \nintentional self-harm, and having that information reported to the DPBH, we will \nbe better armed to develop responsive prevention and intervention strategies \nand expand our postvention support. \n \nThis data supports our efforts to bring zero suicide in Nevada to scale. We \ncannot change what it is that we cannot see. We believe collecting this data \nwill help us shine a light on suicide and ultimately save lives. \n \nAn important part of this bill requires the DPBH to develop regulations specific \nto the reporting of suicide attempts and intentional self-harm. These regulations \nwould be promulgated through the DPBH and approved through the State Board \nof Health. We are seeking to collect a very minimum data set, which would \nallow  us  to  understand  the  frequency  in  which  suicide  attempts  are  being \ntreated in emergency rooms and inpatient settings. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS:  \nThe proposed conceptual amendment, Exhibit J, clarifies the legislative intent of \nsections  6.2,  6.4,  6.6  and  6.8.  We  wanted  to  work  with  stakeholders  on \nclarifying that this data is intended to come from providers of health care in a \nmedical facility or the medical facility itself. This helps to alleviate the pressure \non  our  small  doctor’s  offices  or  general  practitioners  who  may  hear  about \npeople’s feelings but not necessarily become problematic in the intended suicide \ntrack. \n \nThe second part of the bill deals with patient coverage for health insurance. The \nfederal  government  requires  compliance  for  the  Paul  Wellstone  and \nPete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008. This is \nmentioned in our statutes. However, there is a lack of clarity in the health and \ninsurance industry as to what parity metrics are. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nWe are not proposing a prescription to remedy this parity ambiguity today. We \nare requesting the Division of Insurance (DOI) have the authority to proactively \nreview parity metrics from insurance providers in Nevada to determine what the \nbaseline of parity is. The State process for assessing parity starts on the backs \nof our vulnerable populations who have felt their right to parity of services has \nbeen violated. These individuals have to submit a complaint with supporting \nevidence to the DOI for review of their case. This is done when a patient learns \nthe  services  they  seek  are  not  being  covered  and  not  accessible  for  their \nimmediate needs. This bill requests this activity be completed proactively rather \nthan on the backs of patients already in need of support. \n \nThere  is  recent  federal  legislation  that  has  passed  related  to  the  reporting \nrequirements of insurance companies related to this Parity Act. We have been \nworking with the DOI and other stakeholders to ensure the language in this bill \nallows  the  DOI  to  incorporate  those  federal  requirements  while  meeting  the \ndesired parity outcomes proposed through the adoption of this bill. \n \nFinally,  bringing  the  two  pieces  of  this  bill  together,  we  have  included \nrequirements that the data collected by both the DPBH and DOI be prepared in \nreports  and  provided  to  the  Patient  Protection  Commission  for  their \nconsideration in assessing access and coverage for mental and behavioral health \nservices in Nevada. \n \nLEA CASE (Nevada Psychiatric Association): \nI will walk through section 9 of the bill, if necessary, which requires the parity \nreport being submitted to the DOI. I also have background on the federal Parity \nAct if there are any questions. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nAs I understand it, the reporting requirements require a physician to report an \nattempted  suicide.  I  am  not  sure  how  that  works  with  the  concept  of \nconfidentiality. \n \nDR. WOODARD: \nLike all data that is collected through the DPBH, we have some of the highest \nstandards related to confidentiality. We are mirroring the language after the \nlanguage that was developed as part of the overdose reporting requirements \nestablished in A. B. No. 474 of the 79th Session. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nThere is not a lot of detail in the legislation because we intend to provide more \ngranular information related to what will be reported and who will be reporting \nand under what circumstances through the regulatory process. Our intent is to \nnot  be  broad  with  the  implementation  of  this  bill.  We  do  want  to  bring \nstakeholders forward in the development of regulations to ensure we have their \nvoices heard. We will continue to hold confidentiality of patient personal health \ninformation  in  the  highest  regard  and  continue  to  provide  the  necessary \nprotections for that data. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIf a doctor has learned someone has attempted suicide, what does he do? What \nis the burden on the physician? Is the information reported for data collection \nonly to keep a count of the number of attempted suicides? \n \nDR. WOODARD: \nWe  are  able  to  collect  some  of  this  data  through  billing  and  claims  data; \nhowever, the problem we have is the billing and claims data has a lag, and most \nof  that  data  goes  through  a  considerable  process.  Based  on  the  billing  and \nclaims data for 2020, there were just over 866,000 emergency room visits of \nwhich 1,300 were identified as suicide attempts. \n \nWe have other mechanisms we can use to have a sense of what is happening \nthrough  syndrome  surveillance.  Unfortunately,  we  do  not  have  all  hospitals \nreporting through this surveillance. While it is good at helping us to detect, the \naccuracy is not there. \n \nWe  felt  having  this  timely  data  would  assist  us  in  gathering  the  necessary \ninformation as we are starting to see surges in any one geographic area or \nwithin  a  hospital  related  to  the  amount  of  suicide  attempts  being  reported. \nUltimately, this can help us understand what the need is for getting individuals \nthe help they need for postvention and continued efforts for suicide prevention. \nThis  data  can  also  be  helpful  to  the  hospitals  reporting  it,  especially  those \nworking to implement the zero suicide initiative. Being able to package this data \nand provide it back to hospitals so they have their own data to understand how \nfrequently this is occurring will help them in those efforts. We do not intend \nthat outpatient providers would be reporting this information. We are looking for \ninformation provided through hospitals and providers in those hospitals. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nWe have three different methods that the overdose reporting is being provided \nto us depending on what the hospital chooses as a method. The first is via fax \nand the second is through data extract. Hospitals have been able to develop a \nbatch data extract they can transmit to the DPBH or through an electronic form. \nWe have looked into augmenting that electronic form with two data fields that \nwould need to be changed to operationalize it. We have the ability to do this to \nsupport the implementation of this legislation. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nAre only hospitals going to be required to report this information? \n \nDR. WOODARD: \nAt  this  point,  it  would  only  be  hospitals.  As  we  start  to  build  out  crisis \nstabilization centers, there is a possibility we would need to expand, through \nregulation,  the  reach  to  crisis  stabilization  centers  knowing  we  may  have \nindividuals presenting for care in those settings. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nNevada Revised Statutes 441A.220 could include the crisis centers? \n \nDR. WOODARD: \nYes, through the regulatory development process. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe intent of the bill is to capture data upon an initial suicide attempt. A doctor \ncould be treating someone in a hospital and discover they may have attempted \nsuicide a week ago or a month ago. What prevents dual reporting? \n \nDR. WOODARD: \nThrough the regulatory process, we intend to clarify this would be at the point \nof care where someone was receiving care for a suicide attempt or intentional \nself-harm. That would be done through specific ICD-10 codes. A provider would \nhave to determine if the individual met criteria for those diagnoses, and those \ndiagnoses would be reported through this mechanism. \n \nWe would hope the information would come from a point of care where the \npatient is receiving care at the time of the incident so we could alleviate dual \nreporting. Through our data cleansing mechanisms, we can also try to mitigate \nany dual reporting. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nDoes the second half of the bill with regard to parity refer to the parity for \nmental health and addiction? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS: \nThe data collected would be modeled after the federal legislation and those \nrequirements. We would not be requesting that insurance companies duplicate \ntheir  reporting  or  provide  more  information  than  they  are  required  to  report \nfederally. It would include mental, behavioral and addiction metrics. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nAre you looking for data on someone being treated for an appendix removal at \none hospital that could have had this procedure at a different hospital, or is it \nfor mental health and addiction parity? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS: \nThis is specifically related to the types of coverage regulated under the Mental \nHealth Parity and Addiction Equity Act. \n \nJESSICA FERRATO (American College of Emergency Physicians, Nevada Chapter): \nThe  American  College  of  Emergency  Physicians  supports  A.B.  181.  We  are \nseeing an increase of attempted suicides in our emergency rooms, in particular, \nat a frightening rate. This is mostly due to the pandemic and some of the mental \nhealth  challenges  in  homes  with  children,  specifically  in  Washoe  and \nClark Counties. \n \nTREY DELAP (National Alliance on Mental Illness Nevada): \nI will read from written testimony (Exhibit K) in support of A.B. 181. \n \nTOM CLARK (Nevada Association of Health Plans): \nThe Nevada Association of Health Plans is neutral on A.B. 181. We would like \nto thank Assemblywoman Peters for working with us on section 9 of the bill \ndealing with the reporting of information on mental health parity. \n \nBARBARA RICHARDSON (Commissioner of Insurance, Department of Business and \nIndustry): \nThe Department of Business and Industry is neutral on A.B. 181. We echo the \nsupport from others and appreciate a positive vote. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 181 and open the hearing on A.B. 178. \n \nASSEMBLY  BILL  178:  Revises  provisions  relating  to  prescription  drugs. \n(BDR 57-71) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN MELISSA HARDY (Assembly District No. 22): \nI would like to present A.B. 178 which ensures Nevadans have access to their \nprescription medications during a state of emergency or declaration of disaster. \n \nThe Covid-19 pandemic highlights the need to reconsider the rules that limit \naccess to needed prescription drugs for Nevadans such as older adults and \npeople with underlying health conditions during a declared state of emergency \nor disaster. \n \nInsurance  companies  generally  impose  strict  limits  on  the  frequency  of \nmedication refills. Outside of times of crisis, there are valid reasons insurance \ncompanies limit when and how much of certain medications people can obtain \nat  one  time.  They  could  be  misused,  misplaced  or  even  sold  on  the  black \nmarket. Therefore, many people obtain a one-month supply of medicine, which \nworks well for them. \n \nOver a year ago, to facilitate the State’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, \nGovernor Steve Sisolak declared a state of emergency. Nevadans were asked to \nlimit nonessential activities due to the pandemic and were encouraged to limit \ntheir  trips  outside  their  homes  to  gather  essential  items  such  as  food  and \nprescription medications to stay safe and healthy. \n \nDuring this time, the CDC encouraged those at higher risk, particularly older \nadults and those with underlying health conditions, to have at least a 30-day \nsupply  of  prescription  drugs  and  talk  to  a  healthcare  provider,  insurer  or \npharmacist about obtaining an extra supply of their prescriptions, if possible, to \nreduce their trips to a pharmacy. \n \nThis bill came from a personal experience with my mother in a situation early in \nthe shutdown. She needed some of her medications refilled and, at first, was \nunable  to  go  to  the  doctor  as  they  were  not  seeing  patients  during  the \npandemic. Because of the risk with her health, she did not want to go to the \ndoctor or to a lab. She is self-sufficient and takes care of everything herself, but \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nin this case, it took some time and jumping through hoops on my part to help \nher get her medications refilled. From that experience came the desire to bring \nthis legislation forward. \n \nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, people needed easy access to their medications \nwhich was difficult during times of social distancing and their inability to meet \nwith healthcare practitioners. States throughout the Country have addressed \nprescription medication refills in times of natural disasters or a declared state of \nemergency. At least eight states including Arizona, California, Florida, Maryland, \nOklahoma,  South  Carolina,  Texas  and  Washington  allow  pharmacists  to \ndispense early, and/or provide emergency refills of a prescription under certain \ncircumstances. \n \nAssembly Bill 178 requires insurers, including Medicaid, the Public Employees’ \nBenefits Program (PEBP) and local governments that provide coverage for their \nemployees to:  \n \nWaive  any  restrictions  on  the  time  period  within  which  a \nprescription may be refilled for an insured who resides in the area \nto which a state of emergency or declaration of disaster applies if \nthe insured requests the refill within a certain time; and authorize \npayment  for  a  supply  of  a  covered  prescription  drug  for  up  to \n30 days  for  any  insured  who  requests  a  refill  under  those \nconditions. \n \nThe  Commissioner  of  Insurance  may  extend  the  time  periods  as  he  or  she \ndetermines necessary. \n \nTo  respond  effectively  to  urgent  demands  during  a  state  of  emergency  or \nnatural  disaster,  the  public  may  need  increased  access  to  therapeutic \npharmaceuticals.  Meeting  this  need  requires  safely  expanding  access  to \npharmacy  services  and  providing  temporary  and  limited  relief  from  certain \nregulatory restrictions to enhance operational capacity, flexibility and efficiency \noperations. \n \nA pharmacist may refill a prescription only for the number of times authorized, \nor for the number of times authorized by the prescribing practitioner. This bill \ncreates an exception to this rule to allow: \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \n[A] pharmacist to fill or refill a prescription in an amount that is \ngreater than the amount authorized by the prescribing practitioner \nbut does not exceed a 30-day supply of the drug if: the drug is not \na controlled substance listed in schedule II; the patient lives in an \narea where a state of emergency or disaster applies; and the drug \nis  necessary  for  the  patient’s  maintenance  of  life  or  the \ncontinuation of therapy for a chronic condition and interruption of \ntherapy using the drug may be detrimental to the person’s health or \nproduce physical or mental discomfort. \n \nA pharmacist who dispenses drugs under these conditions is required to issue \nand maintain a written order for dispensing the drug and notify the prescribing \npractitioner. \n \nThe fiscal notes from the Department of Business and Industry, DHHS and PEBP \nare on the legislative website, and the State Board of Pharmacy indicates there \nis no fiscal impact. Most of the local governments also note there is no fiscal \nimpact. \n \nAssembly Bill 178 helps people to maintain a continuous supply of medications \nduring a declared state of emergency or disaster. The bill requires an insurer to \nwaive restrictions on medication refills during a declared state of emergency and \nauthorizes payment for a supply of the prescription drug for up to 30 days. \n \nThe measure also authorizes a pharmacist to fill or refill a prescription drug to a \nperson living in an area that is declared a disaster or state of emergency in an \namount greater than is authorized by a prescribing practitioner but does not \nexceed a 30-day supply of the drug under certain circumstances. \n \nI have reached out to and been working with stakeholders to get their input and \ncontinue to make every effort to find solutions to any concerns. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWas there thought given to continuing drugs such as buprenorphine which is \nused to treat someone who has had an addiction to opioids? If we do not, we \nrun the risk of them getting back on opioids. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \nDAVE WUEST (State Board of Pharmacy): \nThe law would allow that as a Schedule III drug. The only restriction would be \nSchedule II drugs. If the pharmacist made the determination that it was in the \nbest interest of the patient, the law would allow that. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN HARDY: \nThis  bill  will  give  peace  of  mind  and  reassurance  to  Nevadans  relying  on \nmedications, knowing they will have access to those medications if we are ever \nin a state of emergency or disaster. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 178 and open the hearing on A.B. 228. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 228 (1st Reprint): Establishes provisions relating to children's \nadvocacy centers. (BDR 38-358) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN BRITTNEY MILLER (Assembly District No. 5): \nI am here today to present A.B. 228. It is traumatic for a child to experience \nabuse and neglect. It can cause lifetime harm to children, their families and \ncommunities.  Many  children  who  experience  maltreatment  are  pulled  into  a \nsystem that requires them to relive the trauma over and over as they have to \nshare their story with law enforcement, child protective services, caseworkers, \nlawyers, investigators and judges. \n \nThis bill provides children who have experienced abuse or neglect a faith and \nchild-focused  environment.  The  bill  requires  State  and  county  child  welfare \nagencies to ensure children who are the victims of abuse or neglect have access \nto a multidisciplinary team (MDT) through a children’s advocacy center (CAC). \nThese  teams  include  professionals  with  backgrounds  in  criminal  justice,  law \nenforcement, child protective services, mental health, and medical and victim \nadvocacy to help children heal from the trauma of abuse or neglect. \n \nCHERYL  COOLEY  (Southern  Nevada  Children’s  Advocacy  Center;  Children’s \nAdvocacy Centers of Nevada): \nThis  bill  legitimizes  and  brings  attention  to  a  multidisciplinary  approach  to \ndealing with child abuse. A lot of our forensic interviews surround children who \nhave been sexually abused. When a child makes an outcry of sexual abuse to \ntheir teacher, for instance, they are letting out the biggest family secret their \nfamily has, and the offenders have tried to keep it quiet. When you have to talk \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \nto a teacher, then a principal, then the police, then child protective services, \nthen  a  doctor,  you  are  losing  traction  with  what  is  happening,  often  in  a \nnegative way. \n \nThe Children’s Advocacy Center brings the child to a CAC where they have a \nforensic interview, a research-based, child-led interview. This is so the children \ncan tell their story of abuse in their own words. We do not want to lead or \ninfluence  the  children  in  any  way.  A  child  can  go  to  a  CAC  and  get  the \nadvocacy and support they need after they disclose such a big secret. \n \nI will now play video testimony from a young college student, Lexi, who has \ngone through that process which can be seen on YouTube on the following link: \n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?tv=rOox5bQkUq>. \n \nJESSE HAW (Children's Advocacy Centers of Nevada): \nLexi is not alone. One out of four girls and one out of six boys nationwide will \nhave something like this happen to them by the time they are 18 years of age. \nMoving towards this legislation, Nevada will join 34 other states who have gone \nto best practices and MDTs like the CAC. We did not create this model; we \nresearched the Country to figure out which was the best. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIf we have four existing CACs in Nevada, why is it important we make it a law \nthat we have CACs? \n \nMR. HAW: \nTwo  of  the  CACs  are  accredited  by  the  National  Children’s  Alliance  (NCA) \nstandards. This bill will set out what the guidance for the CAC is, which will \nchange over time, and the NCA will help guide us on what the most up-to-date \npractices are. \n \nWe have two CACs rising to get that accreditation, which is a long, tough \nprocess. A lot of people will not donate to these types of programs because if it \nis not in statute, they are not sure it is a legitimate program. Having a defined \nlegitimate CAC helps us fundraise and operate them. It determines that best \npractices will be followed; that you will not have someone starting one up that \nis not following what will hopefully be the law. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 27 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI want to ensure you have done extensive research and taken a good look at the \nlanguage set out in NRS to make sure it matches the standard, and that we are \nnot doing anything that will disrupt the work of the current CACs. \n \nMR. HAW: \nWe have had great cooperation with many departments in the north and the \nsouth because it does touch on things from police to district attorneys and is all \nencompassing. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe NCA is a single organization. Are there competing organizations that do the \nsame work? Are we picking one versus another; is it restrictive in any way? \n \nPEG SAMPLES (Washoe County Child Advocacy Center): \nThere  are  other  nonprofit  organizations  that  work  with  CACs  across  the \nCountry. The NCA is the largest and most widely recognized accrediting agency \nin the Country. \n \nJOANNA JACOB (Clark County): \nClark County supports A.B. 228 because it has real-world impacts. It is rare this \nSession that I get to talk about the good things in Clark County child welfare, \nand this is one of them. It is difficult to watch the video of Lexi and not know \nabout the good work that the Clark County Department of Family Services does, \nand our southern Nevada CAC does every day. \n \nNEYDA BECKER (Children’s Advocacy Center Foundation): \nThe  Children’s  Advocacy  Center  Foundation  (CACF)  supports  A.B.  228. \nThrough our public, private partnership with the Clark County Department of \nFamily Services, the CACF serves as the nonprofit and advocacy arm for the \nSouthern  Nevada  Children’s  Advocacy  Center  (SNCAC).  The  CACF  works \ndirectly  with  key  county  personnel  and  SNCAC  team  members  to  provide \nservices to and improve outcomes for child abuse victims and their families. \n \nI have witnessed first-hand the hard work and dedication of Cheryl Cooley, her \nteam and agency partners in serving the needs of at-risk children and their \nfamilies in southern Nevada. I have met and spoken to survivors, and have seen \nthe impact the SNCAC has made in their lives. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 28 \n \nI  was  once  told  the  SNCAC  was  southern  Nevada’s  best  kept  secret.  My \nquestion at that time was to ask why. As the number of suspected child abuse \nand neglect cases in Nevada continue to rise, why keep child advocacy centers \nsecret. They should be acknowledged for the important work they do. \n \nAs you move forward with your deliberations, I urge the Committee to consider \nthe testimony we have heard today, and think of Lexi and the thousands of \nother children and families helped by CACs each year. Please help bring CACs \nout of the shadows and vote in favor of this bill. \n \nMS. BLOCK: \nThe Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers supports A.B. 228. We support \nmultidisciplinary  and  holistic  support  for  youth  to  emphasize  healing  from \ntrauma. We support legislation that aims to help children heal and move on from \ntrauma in a supportive and healing-centered environment. \n \nTESS OPFERMAN (Nevada Women’s Lobby): \nThe  Nevada  Women’s  Lobby  supports  A.B. 228.  Child  abuse  can  be \ncomplicated to address and navigating the process is not easy. It is difficult and \ntraumatic for children to share their story, especially if it requires rehashing their \nstory with one person after another. \n \nCOLE MCBRIDE (Washoe County Child Advocacy Center): \nThe Washoe County Child Advocacy Center supports A.B. 228. \n \nROSS  ARMSTRONG  (Administrator,  Division  of  Child  and  Family  Services, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nI was involved in setting up the CAC in Pahrump and can tell you the amazing \npower this model has in empowering young people who have been abused is \nincredible. \n \nThe Division is neutral on this bill. Part of this bill has the Division setting up an \naccount that can take and distribute donations to qualifying entities. We have \nno concerns about the operational part of the bill. We are happy to do our part \nin terms of supporting this model throughout the State. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 228 and open the hearing on A.B. 345. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 29 \n \nASSEMBLY  BILL  345  (1st  Reprint):  Revises  provisions  relating  to  drug \nparaphernalia. (BDR 40-978) \n \nASSEMBLYMAN DAVID ORENTLICHER (Assembly District No. 20): \nAssembly Bill 345 addresses the problem of opioid overdose deaths in Nevada, \nwhich has been a significant problem for a number of years. There has been a \nrecent increase from the problem of fentanyl-laced heroine and other drugs. \nUsers are buying heroine or methamphetamine and may or may not know that it \nis  laced  with  fentanyl  which  can  cause  an  overdose.  One  way  to  prevent \noverdose deaths is to distribute fentanyl testing strips so users can know what \nthey are buying. Fentanyl is considered illegal drug paraphernalia in Nevada. \n \nThis  bill  excludes  fentanyl  testing  strips  from  the  definition  of  drug \nparaphernalia. There is an information sheet (Exhibit L) on the legislative website \non Fentanyl Testing to Prevent Overdose showing how fentanyl testing strips \nwork. \n \nThere is a conceptual amendment (Exhibit M) to broaden the bill because it is \nfentanyl today; tomorrow, or next year, there may be another adulterant that \ncauses overdose deaths. This way, we do not have to come back for a new bill. \nThe conceptual amendment, Exhibit M, allows other testing products in case \nthere is a different adulterant within the next two years. \n \nThe  bill  now  states  testing  for  adulterants  are  for  use  in  cutting  controlled \nsubstances, and there may be other controlled substances that are adulterated \nthat we may want to also test. \n \nThe existing provision, section 1, subsection 2 has not been amended. That is \nprevious legislation to ensure needles and syringes can be distributed and are \nnot considered contraband. The bill is being interpreted in a restrictive way, so \nwe have been asked to consider expanding some of the items to tourniquets to \nensure people do not get into trouble. \n \nWe are working with law enforcement, and they are comfortable with what we \nhave done so far on the bill and the conceptual amendment, Exhibit M. I have \nnot had occasion to speak with them about further broadness. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 30 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe intent of the bill started with fentanyl testing strips but has been broadened \nin the conceptual amendment, Exhibit M, to test for anything. You will have \nsomething for us by the time we work session the bill that would broaden it \nbeyond narcotics to other controlled substances. Also, to add to the list of \nparaphernalia in subsection 2 that would not be considered criminal. \n \nASSEMBLYMAN ORENTLICHER:  \nIn section 2, subsection 2, paragraph (a) it says, “hypodermic syringe, needle, \ninstrument,  device  or  implement,”  which  should  capture  a  broad  range. \nApparently,  there  have  been  issues  with  this.  The  suggested  language  we \nreceived from people who work in the field would be to add “including sterile \ninjection equipment provided by syringe services programs including mixing or \ncooking devices and tourniquets.” \n \nNICHOLAS SHEPACK (American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada): \nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada supports A.B. 345 and believes \nwe can save lives by decriminalizing certain testing items and items used to \nadminister drugs. I went to high school during the peak of the opioid crisis. I \nburied too many of my friends who fell victim to addiction through prescription \ndrugs  and  heroine.  Once  fentanyl  arrived  on  the  scene,  things  got  uglier. \nFentanyl is found in what is perceived as prescription medication. Exempting \ntest strips from Category E felonies will save lives. \n \nThe war on drugs has criminalized everything from behavioral health issues to \nsimple testing equipment. It is beyond time we start addressing these issues as \nthey are, which are behavioral health issues, and stop criminalizing simple items \nsuch as a syringe or test strip. \n \nLISA RASMUSSEN (Nevada Attorneys for Criminal Justice): \nNevada Attorneys for Criminal Justice supports A.B. 345 as written and with \nthe  conceptual  amendment,  Exhibit  M.  Consistent  with  what  Mr.  Shepack \nstated, we believe this is a productive decriminalization of what is currently \ncategorized  as  paraphernalia  but  should  be  considered  life-saving  tools.  We \nwant people to stop using or possessing illicit drugs that were not prescribed to \nthem. Unfortunately, that is not the reality we live in. \n \nWhat we are seeing on the street today with regard to our clients and cases \ncoming forward, are a lot of high-potency drugs. Even though we would not \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 31 \n \nwant  to  encourage  illicit  drug  use,  having  the  test  strips  available  is \nappropriately  decriminalizing  the  use  of  them  in  a  manner  that  could  allow \npeople to be safe and not end up in an accidental overdose situation. \n \nLISA LEE: \nI support A.B. 345 and its proposed amendment, Exhibit M. As a person in \nlong-term recovery from opioid use disorder, a doctorate student in public health \nand a person who conducts harm reduction outreach and peer support in my \ncommunity, I am terrified the people in my life will all die. I am saddened by the \nfriends I have lost to overdose. In our community, there is fentanyl in pressed \npills,  methamphetamines  and  heroine.  Thanks  to  fentanyl  test  strips  and \nnaloxone, we are able to stay ahead of a steeper trend of fatal drug poisoning. \n \nWhile it is important to test for fentanyl, we know this is the adulterant du jour, \nand we need to keep in mind there will be emerging adulterants threatening \nmore lives. All sterile injection supplies distributed by syringe service programs \nshould be explicitly decriminalized. \n \nDR. WOODARD: \nIn 2020, we had 484 opioid-related overdose deaths, which was more than we \nhad previously when we considered the peak of the opioid crisis in 2011, and \n110 more opioid overdoses than in 2019. This resulted in a 40 percent increase \nStatewide and a 44 percent increase in Clark County. \n \nSynthetic opioid overdose statistics have increased six-fold since 2010, from \n39 to 246 in 2020. These deaths now account for over 50 percent of the \noverdoses in Nevada. Similar to naloxone, fentanyl test strips are an essential \noverdose prevention strategy that must be available within a community. \n \nThe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration announced on \nApril 7, 2021, that states are now able to use federal funds to purchase and \ndistribute fentanyl test strips. These test strips are an essential harm-reduction \nstrategy to reduce opioid-related overdose deaths. The surge in drug overdose \nstatistics nationally, and in Nevada, is driven in large part by fentanyl found in a \nbroad range of substances including methamphetamines. Many people are often \nunaware their drug supply contains fentanyl, resulting in fatal overdose. These \ntest strips allow individuals to test their drugs prior to use to determine if they \ncontain fentanyl. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 32 \n \nThere is a growing body of research that has demonstrated when individuals are \nable to test their drug supply for fentanyl, and fentanyl is identified as being \npresent,  they  change  the  way  they  are  using  those  drugs  to  be  safer  and \nreducing harm. Without explicit exemption of fentanyl test strips and other such \ntesting supplies as drug paraphernalia, distribution by the State and community \norganizations would be significantly hindered, and individuals in possession of \ntesting strips would be at risk for further charges. \n \nJESSICA JOHNSON (Southern Nevada Health District): \nThe Southern Nevada Health District is neutral on S.B. 345. By now, you are \nfamiliar with the opioid epidemic and its impact on drug overdose statistics, \nwhich are now the leading cause of death in the U.S. for people under the age \nof 50. Unfortunately, according to the Southern Nevada Health Districts 2020 \nmortality data, the new wave in the overdose epidemic is fueled by adulterated \nand  counterfeit  opioids,  primarily  fentanyl.  This  preliminary  data  suggests \nfentanyl is being used in counterfeit pills and impacting younger Nevadans when \ncompared to non-fentanyl fatalities. \n \nWhile fentanyl is currently the most recognizable adulterant in the drug supply, \nit is not the only one of concern. Numerous other adulterants exist for which \nthere is much less available data. In the past year alone, approximately 27 novel \npsychoactive substances were identified; that is more than two per month. \n \nResearch  has  demonstrated  that  comprehensive  drug  checking  is  an \nevidence-based strategy and should be part of a broader approach to address \nthe risks associated with the proliferation of fentanyl and emerging adulterants \nin our drug supply. Given this evolution, broadly including adulterant testing \nwould  allow  for  a  more  rapid  response  to  emerging  novel  psychoactive \nsubstances in our communities.   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 29, 2021 \nPage 33 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 345.

(BDR 40-220) \n \nSENATOR DALLAS HARRIS (Senatorial District No. 11): \nIt  is  my  honor  to  present  S.B.  275.  With  me  today  is  former  State \nSenator David Parks,  Andre  Wade  from  Silver  State  Equality  and \nNathan Cisneros  from  the  Williams  Institute.  Senate  Bill  275  will  modernize \nNevada's laws on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by treating HIV as all \nother communicable diseases are treated. In doing so, Nevada will remove from \nstatute  all  discriminatory  laws  unfairly  targeting  people  because  of  their \nHIV status. These laws were not rooted in science but in fear and have had \nsignificant negative public health consequences for Nevada for decades. \n \nSenate Bill 275 is the culmination of many years of thoughtful discussion and \nhard work led by former Senator Dave Parks. I have asked him to join me to \nprovide  you  a  historical  overview  of  how  we  got  to  this  important  hearing \ntoday.  \n \nDAVID PARKS: \nAs a former Nevada Senator, I was successful in getting S.B. No. 284 of the \n80th Session passed, which created the Advisory Task Force on HIV Exposure \nModernization. A report (Exhibit B) the Task Force delivered to the Legislature \ncontained many recommendations now in S.B. 275 to examine statutes related \nto the criminalization of HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) \nand  make  recommendations  for  their  revision.  These  statutes  taken  under \nreview grew out of recommendations from an advisory task force created by \nformer Governor Richard Bryan 35 years ago in 1986. Over the 30 years the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \ntask force was in place, I was a member of that Task Force. During the early \nyears  of  the  HIV  infection  and  AIDS  epidemic,  states  including  Nevada \nimplemented HIV-specific criminal exposure laws. These laws imposed criminal \npenalties on people knowing their condition of living with HIV, who potentially \nexposed  others.  In  1990,  the  Ryan  White  Comprehensive  AIDS  Resources \nEmergency Act provided states with funding for HIV/AIDS treatment and care. It \nrequired every state receiving funds to certify its criminal laws were adequate to \nprosecute any HIV individual who knowingly exposed another person to HIV. In \nour legal system, criminalization of potential HIV exposure is largely a matter of \nstate law and not federal legislation. An analysis by the Centers for Disease \nControl  and  Prevention  (CDC)  and  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  found \n67 laws enacted in 33 states explicitly focused on persons living with HIV. The \nmajority  of  these  laws  were  passed  before  antiretroviral  therapies  were \ndeveloped  that  reduced  HIV  transmission  risk  to  zero.  It  is  possible  to  be \nHIV positive and have no detectable presence of the virus. \n \nAs a person who helped develop Nevada's HIV/AIDS statutes and regulations in \nthe late 1980s and early 1990s, this is an issue I have wrestled with the last \nfour Legislative Sessions. Over the years, we found that criminalization laws do \nnot support evidence-based public health practices reaching those who are at \nhigh risk for HIV and AIDS. Data indicated people who are at high risk for \nHIV exposure  are  deterred  from  testing  which  facilitates  HIV  care  and \nprevention  methods  that  will  stop  the  transmission  of  HIV.  They  are  being \ncharged with life-altering felony charges, prosecuted for living with HIV, not \ndisclosing their status and affecting both testing and care. \n \nWith the passage of S.B. No. 284 of the 80th Session, a coalition of social \nservice and healthcare professionals from across the State and Nation worked \ndiligently to address this issue and develop recommendations for consideration \nby the Legislature. The work accomplished by the Task Force was beyond my \nwildest  expectation.  It  is  long  past  time  for  Nevada  to  modernize  these \nHIV laws. \n \nANDRE WADE (Silver State Equality; Chair, Advisory Task Force on HIV Exposure \nModernization): \nI  am  State  Director  for  Silver  State  Equality,  a  Nevada-based  Statewide \nLGBTQ civil rights organization which brings the voices of LGBTQ people and \nallies  to  the  institutions  of  power  in  Nevada  and  across  the  United  States \nstriving  to  create  a  world  that  is  healthy,  just  and  fully  equal  for  all \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nLGBTQ+ people. I am also the Chair of the Nevada HIV Modernization Coalition \nand speak on behalf of both groups with our support statement (Exhibit C). For \ndecades, we have had laws (Exhibit D) which are ineffective and discriminatory. \nThey do more harm than good. Efforts are underway to end the HIV epidemic, \nin  part  by  developing  Statewide  and  local  plans  to  address  people  getting \ntested, seeking care and staying in care. These plans include modernizing laws \n(Exhibit E) that otherwise criminalize legal behavior or increase penalties for \ncriminal behavior based on a person's HIV status. These laws stigmatize people \nliving with HIV and go against public health efforts to end the HIV epidemic. \nThese laws have been put in place by specifically calling out HIV when other \nclinical diseases are not. \n \nThe issue is to simply treat HIV like any other clinical disease. I have submitted \na statement of support (Exhibit F). This effort is also supported by the CDC, the \nNational Institutes of Health, American Medical Association and the U.S. Office \nof Infectious Disease and HIV/Aids Policy. Human immunodeficiency virus is a \npublic health issue not a criminal one; our laws should reflect that. \n \nNATHAN CISNEROS (HIV Criminalization Analyst, Williams Institute, School of Law, \nUniversity of California, Los Angeles): \nThe Task Force asked us to analyze data on individuals who came into contact \nwith the Nevada criminal justice system through HIV-related crimes. We have \nconducted seminal analysis in other states, and I will present initial findings. We \ncounted 37 people who were arrested for HIV-related crimes in Nevada. We \ncounted  76  individual  HIV-related  charges  across  67  arrest  cycles.  This  is \nbroadly in line with the per capita rate we have seen in other states and is \ndozens more than we observe in either press reports or public court documents. \n \nAbout two-thirds of those individual arrest charges are for sex work-related \ncharges for solicitation or engaging in prostitution after a positive HIV test. The \nother  one-third  is  for  intentional  transmission  of  HIV,  either  intentional \ntransmission  attempted  or  conspiracy.  We  see  no  evidence  that  arrests  are \ndecreasing  over  time.  For  example,  we  observed  20  arrests  for  solicitation \ncharges before 2013. We saw 29 arrests for solicitation charges after 2013 in a \nrising trend for transmission or attempted transmission arrests. \n \nIndividuals  arrested  in  other  states  revealed  HIV  crimes  disproportionately \nimpact people of color. Over half of those arrested for HIV crimes in Nevada are \nBlack;  however,  Black  Nevadans  make  up  just  9  percent  of  the  State's \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \npopulation and 27 percent of Nevada's population of people living with HIV. \nSimilar  to  other  states,  HIV  crimes  disproportionately  impact  women. \nSixteen percent  of  people  living  with  HIV  in  Nevada  are  women.  Almost \none-third of those arrested for HIV crimes are women. \n \nRegarding outcomes, we saw that 30 percent of all charges resulted in a guilty \noutcome either at trial or the individual pled guilty. There is a racial imbalance in \nthese guilty outcomes. The overwhelming majority of those found guilty for sex \nwork-related crimes are Black. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nIn the conceptual amendment (Exhibit G), sections 1, 2 and 5 require orders \nissued by State and local health authorities requiring a person to undergo a \nmedical examination to verify the presence of a communicable disease or order \nisolation, quarantine or treatment. Due to the presence of exposure to such a \ndisease, to also state the reasons the action prescribed by the order are the \nleast  restrictive  course  necessary  to  prevent,  suppress  or  control  the \ncommunicable disease. \n \nSection  4  language  proposed  to  be  added  to  Nevada  Revised  Statutes \n(NRS) 441A.040 in the original bill was stricken by the conceptual amendment. \nSection 3 sets forth legislative findings that the spread of communicable disease \nis best addressed through public health measures, not criminalization. Section 6, \nsubsection 4 provides an exemption for creating an affirmative defense to a \ncharge under NRS 441A.180. Section 6 also states how to determine whether a \nperson acted intentionally. \n \nSection 24 repeals a provision of law making it a Category B felony for a person \nwho has tested positive for HIV to intentionally, knowingly or willfully engage in \nconduct in a manner intended to or likely to transmit the disease. It refers you \nback to section 6 where a person would instead be guilty of a misdemeanor. \nSection 7 revises conditions under which a court may order a person be tested \nfor communicable disease. Section 7 requires a court to determine whether it is \nnecessary to test the other person to determine the appropriate treatment for a \nfirst responder, county coroner or medical examiner. \n \nSection 11 deals with alleged victims or witnesses to a crime that alleged the \ncrime involved sexual penetration of the victim's body. The health authority \nmust  offer  to  test  the  person  for  sexually  transmitted  diseases.  Section 17 \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nrequires the Legislative Counsel to ensure people living with HIV are referred to \nin the Nevada Revised Statutes using language commonly viewed as respectful \nand sentence structure that refers to the person before referring to his or her \ndisorder. Section 18 provides the policy of the State is that such persons are \nreferred to in a similar manner in the Nevada Administrative Code (NAC). \n \nSections  8,  9,  11  through  14,  16  and  19  through  21  revise  terminology \nreferring to HIV, other communicable diseases and related issues. Section 24 \nrepeals laws that require a person arrested for prostitution or solicitation for \nprostitution and each offender in the custody of Department of Corrections be \ntested  for  HIV.  We  have  repealed  the  provision  of  law  which  makes  it  a \nCategory B felony to engage in prostitution after testing positive for HIV. We \nalso  repealed  the  section  that  requires  the  Director  of  the  Department  of \nCorrections to establish an educational program related to HIV for inmates and \nemployees of the Department. Sections 10 and 15 make conforming changes to \nremove  references  to  the  repealed  sections.  Section  22  reestablishes  the \nAdvisory Task Force on HIV Exposure Modernization for the 2021-2022 Interim \nSession which was originally created by S.B. No. 284 of the 80th Legislative \nSession. This bill is comprehensive and seeks to modernize our HIV laws across \nthe board. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIf a person knows he or she is HIV positive and has sex or shares a needle with \nsomeone, is that individual now guilty of a misdemeanor and not a felony? \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nIt would depend. The sharing of a needle is a consensual choice. If the other \nperson knows that person has HIV and chooses that behavior, whether it is sex \nor sharing a needle, then that person would not be guilty of the misdemeanor \neither—HIV is the only communicable disease where a felony would have been \nattached. Hopefully, this will change after passage of this bill. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe person who knows he or she has HIV and has sex with somebody is now \npotentially guilty of a misdemeanor, not a felony? \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nYes.  An  affirmative  defense  is  fairly  important;  if  those  relations  were \nconsensual, the person would not be guilty of the misdemeanor. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWhen you say consensual, do you mean consensual as in not rape, or do you \nmean, \"I am positive for HIV, and is it okay if I have sex with you?\" Is that \nwhat you mean by consensual? \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nYes, the latter. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nDoes  the  CDC  have  any  role  in  describing  this  affirmative  transmission \nfrequency or the science? Has the CDC weighed in on this? \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nAs far as the affirmative defense, the CDC does not play a role in that. We \npulled the affirmative defense from NRS. It already was in place for the felony \nwe are repealing, so we are moving that same language underneath this new \nsection. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nHas the CDC weighed in on the transmissibility risks of those interactions? \n \nMR. WADE: \nThe CDC has weighed in on active transmission, and recent research shows the \nrisk of HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is low, even if people are \nnot using condoms or taking medications that reduce risk. The CDC estimates \nthat the per act risk of transmission varies from close to zero percent to a \nmaximum average of 1.38 percent, depending on the type of intercourse. The \nactual rate of transmission is low.  \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nRegarding  the  definition  of  communicable  disease,  is  the  coronavirus  a \ncommunicable disease? \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nYes. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nChanges in section 2 include requiring people to isolate or quarantine for an \nexposure when they have been in an infectious state to prevent, suppress or \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \ncontrol  the  contagious  or  infectious  disease.  That  seems  counterintuitive  to \neverything we have done for the past year in terms of social distancing and \nisolation. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nCertainly all these laws predate coronavirus and were applied to coronavirus, \nbut these are more along tuberculosis and any other number of conditions. This \nbill actually does change the definition for all communicable diseases, not just \nHIV/AIDS. \n \nTORY JOHNSON (HIV/AIDS Program Director, Division of Public and Behavioral \nHealth, Department of Health and Human Services): \nI can only speak to HIV as that is my expert subject matter. Although I do work \nin public health, I am not well versed in Covid-19. I can get information, speak \nto my colleagues and get back to you. \n \nKYRA MORGAN (Chief Biostatistician, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nCovid-19 is a communicable disease. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWe need to explore changes related to the power of local health districts in \ngetting people to isolate under broader global pandemic-type conditions. When it \ncomes to section 7, it relates to testing of first responders and public health \nofficers who believe they have been exposed. This seems to make a significant \nchange that would require them to have had a negative test before. It does not \nsay when or if there was specific knowledge that the person who potentially \nexposed someone was infected. Can you explain that section, and what are we \ntrying to accomplish? \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nCertainly. This section was developed in consultation with the Clark County Fire \nDepartment. You are looking at compromise language we put together with \nfirst responders.  We  do  not  want  to  subject  people  to  unnecessary  testing, \nalthough we want to ensure our first responders are kept safe when they have \nbeen potentially exposed. This language accomplishes those dual goals. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nUnder this language, what is the process if police officers are in a confrontation \nand  have  bodily  fluids  exposed  to  them?  Under  what  conditions  are  they \nallowed to test? What is the incubation period for contracting communicable \ndiseases and how long after exposure would an individual start testing positive? \nCan medical interventions be used in that interim time to suppress or prevent \ninfection? \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nThe only test is to determine an appropriate treatment for the first responder, \nthen the testing could happen in conjunction with coming into contact with \nhuman blood or bodily fluids. \n \nMR. WADE: \nFor the record and to dispel some myths, there is no documented evidence of \ntransmission of HIV through biting, spitting, scratching or bodily fluids. This is \nsomething  the  Association  of  Prosecuting  Attorneys  has  researched  and \nendorsed in general HIV policy. We have to be clear that a lot of these thoughts \nabout how HIV is transmitted are incorrect. When we craft these laws, we need \nto  ensure  it  does  not  provide  misinformation  out  of  step  with  science  and \nstigmatizing. The way it is described here, it would not transmit HIV. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThis bill is about all communicable diseases, and I have been told for a year that \nI cannot breathe on people. We are trying to eliminate stigma and criminalization \nrelated to HIV, but a communicable disease is a broad term in that implications \ndownstream need to be considered. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nSection 7 has the provision stating you have to come in contact with human \nblood  or  bodily  fluids,  so  this  would  not  address  someone  breathing  on  a \nfirst responder. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWhat was the process for working with the health districts to ensure they are \ncomfortable with this bill? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nThe HIV Modernization Task Force had health district experts at the table from \nthe  beginning  to  develop  this  legislation.  There  was  plenty  of  discussion \nbetween HIV advocates and the health districts to get to the legislation you see \nbefore you. For that reason, the bill is a bit broader than just the sections that \nonly call out HIV. Both Washoe County Health District and Southern Nevada \nHealth District were important partners in getting to the bill we have today. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWe heard earlier from Mr. Cisneros about the arrest statistics related to the \ncriminalization provisions we are trying to eliminate. Are there any documented \ncases  of  infection  related  to  those  arrests  or  transmission  related  to  those \narrests? \n \nMR. CISNEROS: \nThe data we have from the Department of Public Safety is arrest information; \nwe do not have any public health data. \n \nQUENTIN SAVWOIR (Deputy Director, Make It Work Nevada; Member, Advisory \nTask Force on HIV Exposure Modernization): \nWe support S.B. 275. We are long past due for modernizing our State laws on \nHIV. Such laws are rooted in stigma and uncertainties around the virus that are \nno  longer  uncertain.  Furthermore,  laws  disproportionately  impact  Black \ncommunities and communities of color that are more likely living with HIV. This \nbody passed S.C.R. No. 1 of the 32nd Special Session declaring racism a public \nhealth crisis. This measure had bipartisan support in both chambers and is in \nalignment with the intentions of this Senate concurrent resolution. We can begin \nto curb the criminalization of Black and Latino communities living with HIV by \npassing S.B. 275. \n \nRO GIL: \nI  support  S.B.  275.  I  am  a  social  work  student  and  former  housing  case \nmanager  for  people  living  with  HIV.  This  bill  would  modernize  Nevada's \nHIV-related laws that perpetuate stigma against people living with HIV. I have \nseen the impact of stigma and discrimination on people living with HIV or AIDS. \nTo name a few, clients have endured loss of hope, feelings of worthlessness, \naddiction, isolation, depression and loss of income or livelihood. People exposed \nto societal stigma often undertake internalized stigma. Internal life stigma is the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nprocess in which people believe the negative messaging or stereotypes about \nthemselves, which can possibly harm them or others. \n \nSome outcomes and its effects include not getting tested for HIV because of \nthe  negative  consequences  with  knowing  one  has  HIV.  Modernization  is \nnecessary because these laws are failing to stop the spread of HIV, as Nevada \nis ranked eighteenth in the Nation for the number of diagnosed cases. These \nlaws continue to negatively impact Nevada residents and families. \n \nDAWN CHRISTENSEN (Nevada Resort Association): \nWe support S.B. 275. Nevada's resort industry has a long-standing commitment \nto  corporate  social  responsibility  (CSR)  programs  and  initiatives  and  has  a \nhistory of leadership in this space. The key pillars of most CSR programs are \nphilanthropy, environmental sustainability, diversity, equity and inclusion, which \nwork in tandem to strengthen our community and create better outcomes for \npeople and the planet. \n \nMore  than  two  years  ago,  the  Nevada  Resort  Association  created  its \nCSR coalition aimed at harnessing our members' individual CSR efforts through \na  collective  impact  model  of  collaboration  and  shared  goals  to  address  our \ncommunities'  challenges  and  make  a  greater  impact.  Diversity,  equity  and \ninclusion have become a priority for the coalition as we worked on increasing \naccess,  opportunity  and  equity  for  all.  Nevada  law  unfairly  targets  people \nbecause of their HIV status and disproportionately impacts certain communities \nmore likely living with HIV. Senate Bill 275 seeks to change that by modernizing \nour outdated laws that treat HIV differently from every other communicable \ndisease. \n \nKIMI COLE: \nI  support  S.B.  275.  This  is  an  opportunity  to  accurately  and  effectively \nrecognize scientific understanding of HIV and pass legislation to improve public \nhealth, while sparing taxpayers the unnecessary burden of paying for onerous \nand  ineffective  prosecutions.  Laws  have  done  nothing  to  mitigate  issues \noriginally  and  erroneously  intended  to  protect  society  that  accomplished  the \nopposite.  Outdated  laws  criminalize  an  affliction,  not  actions  that  cause \nintentional  harm  to  others.  Understanding  of  HIV  long  ago  passed  original, \narchaic and inaccurate perceptions of an affliction effectively monitored and \ntreated for long-term quality of life. It is time to correct this situation and move \non. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nJASMIN MARGARITA TOBON: \nI support S.B. 275. I am an organizer with Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada. \nNevada laws treat the HIV epidemic as a criminal offense rather than a public \nhealth crisis. With science and knowledge, we know better, and this is our \nopportunity to do better. Criminalization is not the answer and never was, but      \nscience  is.  Despite  advances  in  HIV  care  and  science,  Nevada's \nHIV criminalization laws are still based on decades-old science. Criminalization \ndiscourages  testing,  treatment  and  disclosure  resulting  in  stigma  and \npreventable deaths. Whether it is the horribly mismanaged AIDS epidemic in the \n1990s  or  the  coronavirus  pandemic,  Black,  Indigenous  and  People  of  Color \n(BIPOC) and LGBTQ individuals suffer the most and have led the movement for \njustice for their communities. This bill is an act of long-overdue justice and \naligns with the needs of Nevadans. \n \nJOHN PIRO (Deputy Public Defender, Clark County Public Defender's Office): \nWe support S.B. 275. This bill modernizes our laws to remove some of the \noutdated and discriminatory laws passed during a time when we as a society \nused HIV to stigmatize and discriminate against our LGBTQ community. Instead \nof dealing with HIV, which is a public health issue, Nevada's criminal code has \nbeen used as an ineffective hammer to solve problems the criminal code was \nnever designed to solve. As Maya Angelou instructed us \"do the best you can \nuntil you know better, and then when you know better, do better.\" We now \nknow better, and it is time to do better and modernize our laws. \n \nJADA HICKS (Supervising Attorney, The Center for HIV Law and Policy): \nWe support S.B. 275. There are 32 states that have HIV-specific laws that \nimpose  criminal  liabilities.  These  laws  impose  either  misdemeanor  or  felony \npunishment and explicitly target HIV. Results are found in criminal codes or \npublic  health  codes,  and  some  of  these  laws  define  criminal  offenses  for \nexposing others to HIV. Others outline harsher penalties for people living with \nHIV for acts already considered criminal. \n \nCriminalization of HIV is fueled primarily by the inaccurate belief that HIV is \neasily transmitted and fatal, neither of which is true. These laws conflict with \npublic health goals that laws have no impact on risky behavior or on the number \nof new HIV diagnoses. Learning about one's HIV status discourages individuals \nbecause they must know about their HIV status to face prosecution. It drags \nlaw enforcement into what is essentially a public health issue without training \non how these diseases are transmitted, prevented and treated. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nResearch shows most prosecutions target Black men and women, sex workers \nfor solicitation and those who suffer from mental illness. Government policies \nand outdated understanding of disease transmission also enshrined stigma at \nodds with public health campaigns and campaigns to end the epidemic. Many in \nlaw enforcement are not only supporting but leading the charge to approach \nHIV from a public health perspective instead of through the criminal justice legal \nsystem. \n \nALEX CAMBEROS (Battle Born Progress): \nWe support S.B. 275. We are a nonpartisan organization in Nevada to ensure \nfairness  and  equal  opportunity  to  succeed  for  all  Nevadans.  Nevada  laws \nregarding  criminalization  are  outdated,  ineffective  and  discriminatory.  I  have \nsubmitted my written testimony (Exhibit H). \n \nWESLEY JUHL (American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada): \nWe support S.B. 275. We support the work to take harmful stigma out of our \nState  laws.  I  say  ditto  to  the  other  policy  remarks.  As  a  queer  man,  my \nexperience has been that discussions about HIV and AIDS are far too often \ntangled up in homophobia and transphobia, and my sense is the same is true \nwith  Nevada's  criminalization  scheme.  When  looking  at  the  groups  most \nvulnerable to contracting HIV, it is clear this epidemic is also tangled up with \nracial and economic issues. Some of the first volunteer work I did in my early \n20s was HIV prevention outreach with the Center for HIV Law and Policy, and \nwe  always  said  get  tested  and  know  your  status.  The  sad  truth  is  that \ncriminalization  of  HIV  serves  as  a  major  obstacle  to  these  important  public \nhealth messages. \n \nKENDRA BERTSCHY (Deputy Public Defender, Washoe County Public Defender's \nOffice): \nWe support S.B. 275. I agree with the callers before me. This bill will allow \nindividuals with medical issues to be outside of the criminal justice system. I \nhave  had  a  handful  of  clients  who  indicated  they  became  involved  in  the \ncriminal justice system because of the stigma associated with their disease that \nled them to use alcohol and substances. This bill will help all Nevadans. \n \nCAITLIN GWIN (Sex Worker Alliance of Nevada): \nWe support S.B. 275. This bill will improve the health and safety of those who \nengage in sex work. The pattern of criminalization only makes it more likely that \nindividuals will continue in this work and make it harder for them to leave the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nindustry if they so desire. Criminal records make it harder to get traditional \nemployment. Expenses incurred throughout arrest and incarceration make these \npeople more financially vulnerable and more likely to engage in sex work. \n \nEMILY DRISCOLL (National Lawyers Guild, Las Vegas Chapter): \nWe support S.B. 275. Human immunodeficiency virus is the only disease that \ncriminalizes people just for having the disease. Nevada law does not protect \npeople but puts Nevadans at risk for transmission. It creates a disincentive to \npeople from getting HIV tests because knowing their status means they are \nmore likely to receive felony charges. Nevada laws governing HIV have put \nvulnerable Nevadans at risk for criminalization and unnecessary disease spread. \nThese  laws  disproportionately  affect  members  of  the  gay  community, \ntransgender  people  and  street-based  sex  workers,  all  of  whom  are \ndisproportionately impacted. \n \nIf this bill gets passed, Nevadans could safely seek treatment and testing for \nHIV and remain  nontransmittable without having to worry about the stigma \nsurrounding the virus. Existing laws come from fear and homophobic campaigns \nthat aim to harm people who did not fit the framework of an acceptable citizen. \nThese laws mainly affect BIPOC, gay, transgender and poor people. \n \nCONNIE SHEARER (The Nevada HIV Modernization Coalition): \nWe support S.B. 275. I am a 25-year survivor of HIV and one of the founding \ncochairs for the Nevada HIV Modernization Coalition. We should all care about \nreforming the outdated HIV criminalization laws in Nevada. Significant advances \nhave been made in our scientific understanding of HIV and medical interventions \navailable to treat it. Our laws should reflect this progress and not criminalize \nbehavior that poses no risk of transmission. The laws are preventing people \nfrom getting tested out of fear of being criminalized and getting into treatment \nthat we now know prevents the spread of HIV. \n \nThe daily treatment I receive is called antiretroviral therapy. I am what is known \nas virally suppressed which means the virus inside my body is unable to be \ntransmitted to someone with whom I am having a sexual relationship. There are \ncountless more like me who were exposed and acquired HIV but have not found \nout their status. That means they are untested, not in treatment, too afraid to \nget tested and possibly told by a doctor their symptoms are not HIV because \nthey are not in a high-risk group or because they do not have equitable access \nto treatment. We are not going to criminalize a public health issue away. Many \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \npeople who are not living with HIV do not understand it is not just the charges \nthat ruin people's lives. The stigmatizing language used by the media, public and \nthis  legislative  body  continues  to  perpetuate  outdated  myths  and  opinions. \nLanguage in this bill commits to modernizing outdated laws. \n \nJOANNA JACOB (Clark County): \nWe  are  neutral  on  S.B.  275.  I  have  been  working  with  Clark  County  Fire \nDepartment on this bill, specifically section 7. We are in support of the rest of \nthe bill, the stated testimony today and the goals of the Task Force. On behalf \nof the Clark County Firefighters and the unions who are testifying, the concerns \nwith section 7 are that it would pose a barrier, and we consider that a public \nhealth issue when we have first responders responding to an emergency and \ncome in contact with the public. If they are exposed to a communicable disease, \nwe must err on the side of safety for our employees and get them tested as \nsoon as possible to find out if they were exposed. We are continuing to work on \nthe language. However, we have concerns it is shifting the burden of proof in a \npublic health statute, and this is not a criminal statute. This is our concern \nbecause it applies to all communicable diseases. \n \nBRADLEY MAYER (Southern Nevada Health District): \nWe  are  neutral  on  S.B.  275.  We  will  continue  to  work  on  amendments \nespecially  related  to  the  communicable  disease  discussion  in  addition  to \nsections 7 and 11. \n \nALISA HOWARD (Owner, Minority Health Consultants): \nWe support S.B. 275. As a former HIV Ryan White Program Director and now \nthe  owner  of  Minority  Health  Consultants,  I  am  saddened  that  outdated, \nineffective and discriminatory Nevada laws that criminalize HIV are still here. \nThe CDC and State data show us HIV is the most dangerous, infectious disease \naside from Covid-19 which threatens the lives of minorities to include African \nAmericans, Latinx and LGBTQ communities that have the highest amounts of \nmorbidity and mortality. \n \nTODD INGALSBEE (Professional Fire Fighters of Nevada): \nWe  are  neutral  on  S.B.  275.  I  would  like  to  ditto  the  comments  made  by \nClark County regarding section 7. We support the bill and everything it does. \nWe just want to make sure our members are protected, tested—whether an \nintentional or accidental exposure—promptly for any communicable disease so \nwe are not spreading the disease and medicated to prevent us from getting the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \ndisease. We are neutral for now; however, we look forward to working together \nso we can all agree and get this bill passed. \n \nJENNIFER HOWELL (Sexual Health Program Coordinator, Washoe County Health \nDistrict): \nWe are neutral on S.B. 275. I also serve on the Governor's Advisory Task Force \non HIV Exposure Modernization and cochair the Northern Nevada HIV Prevention \nPlanning  Group.  Washoe  County  supports  the  modernization  of  HIV-related \nstatutes to match the extraordinary advances in HIV care and prevention. These \nefforts are needed to end the HIV epidemic, which is within our grasp. \n \nWashoe County Health District suggested amendments reflecting the collective \nfeedback of our public health partners, Southern Nevada Health District and \nongoing community discussion. Moving HIV into the public health realm and \naddressing it the same as other communicable diseases assists public health \nwith intervening in proven ways by expanding access, building trust within the \ncommunity  and  using  evidence-based  interventions  in  achieving  healthier \noutcomes. Yet, we have legislation allowing us to address and intervene in an \nexpeditious  manner  given  the  diverse  communicable  diseases  covered  in \nNRS 441A and NAC Chapter 441A. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nI am committed to working with Clark County Firefighters as well as our health \ndistrict partners to make sure we get this right. This has been a labor of love, \nand we are almost there. Although my name is on the bill, what you see is a \nproduct of decades of work by former Senator Parks. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe will now close the hearing on S.B. 275 and open the hearing on S.B. 379. \n \nSENATE  BILL  379:  Provides  for  the  collection  of  certain  data  concerning \nproviders of health care. (BDR 40-457) \n \nSENATOR JOSEPH P. HARDY (Senatorial District No. 12): \nI am presenting S.B. 379 on behalf of the Legislative Committee on Health Care. \nA group of stakeholders who came to the Interim Committee and heard its \nreport said we should do something. This resulted in the health workforce data \ncollection through the licensure renewal process. This bill talks about having a \nway to find who is doing what, where, when and how in the field of health \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \ncare. Upon the renewal of a license, certificate or registration as a provider of \nhealth  care,  we  are  asking  to  have  a  short,  confidential  survey  completed \nvoluntarily.  This  bill  will  probably  have  some  friendly  amendments. \nDr. John Packham will walk us through the process by which we would identify \npeople. The key in the bill is using language to attract more persons, including \nmembers of unrepresented groups, and improve health outcomes.   \n \nJOHN PACKHAM, M.D. (Associate Dean, Office of Statewide Initiatives, University \nof Nevada, Reno, School of Medicine): \nThe heart of this bill is to utilize licensure renewal for health providers in Nevada \nto capture better, more accurate and complete data on where they practice, the \nextent to which they represent or reflect the populations they serve and to \ninform public policy in Nevada. As a State, we are leaving money on the table \nwhen we do not accurately establish and maintain health professional shortage \narea  designations,  which  funnel  into  State  and  federal  reimbursement  for \nprofessionals serving in medically underserved areas. Licensure renewal provides \nthat mechanism to collect data better than we do now. This bill is not simply \nabout data collection. It will improve access to care, attract and keep health \nprofessionals in our State. I have submitted a written report (Exhibit I). \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThis bill is positive going forward to attract health professionals to come to \nNevada and stay here, looking and sounding like the people they serve. We have \nspecial groups of people who need care, and we have not been good at doing \nthis.  Many  times  in  the  bipolar  community,  we  need  to  get  people \nimmunizations, screenings and care, and develop a trust factor. This survey can \nhelp us determine who we need to recruit and how to keep them in our State. \nOne of the issues that comes up deals with confidentiality. We are working on \nlanguage,  along  with  our  stakeholders,  to  ensure  people  are  not  identified \nindividually by the survey results. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIs the data collection voluntary on the part of the providers and done through a \nweb portal directed straight to the Department of Health and Human Services \n(DHHS) and not the actual licensing boards via the amendment? \n \nDR. PACKHAM: \nThe idea is to use the licensure renewal. If physicians or nurses are renewing \ntheir licenses online, a link would take them to the DHHS website where they \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nwould complete the survey, return to their licensure renewal and submit it. The \nquestions would be voluntary. I would never want to do anything to stand in the \nway of an individual getting relicensed. We do not want to be a barrier. The idea \nwould  be  to  ask  questions  eight  to  ten  minutes  long  every  two years.  The \nquestions asked would tell us where the individuals practice, if they work in a \nhealth professional shortage area and so forth. There are ways to streamline \nquestions  to  make  the  survey  less  of  a  burden.  There  are  also  ways  to \nstreamline  the  survey  to  avoid  answering  the  same  questions  in  two  or \nfour years from now. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nI was concerned about the survey asking how many hours per week a doctor \nworks and whether he or she is planning to retire anytime in the next five years. \nWould these questions discourage individuals from filling out the survey? \n \nDR. PACKHAM: \nI am wary of questions compelling someone to not complete the survey, be it on \nretirement plans, race, ethnicity or the like. Respondents would be given the \noption to not reply with the hope they would complete the other questions. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe  are  referring  to  an  amendment,  and  it  would  be  helpful  to  have  clarity \nbecause multiple amendments were submitted, including from the Chiropractic \nPhysicians' Board of Nevada (Exhibit J), State Board of Osteopathic Medicine \n(Exhibit K) and the Board of Medical Examiners (Exhibit L). \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI anticipate they are all interested in the same things, and we will come to \ncommon language. \n \nJARON HILDEBRAND (Nevada State Medical Association): \nWe support S.B. 379. We believe in having more robust workforce data that will \nprovide us a solid roadmap to solve our provider shortage issue in this State. \n \nMR. MAYER:  \nSouthern Nevada Health District supports S.B. 379. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nNANCY BOWEN (Nevada Primary Care Association): \nWe support S.B. 379. I represent the State's community health centers which \nserve geographically isolated and traditionally underserved communities. In rural \nareas, they are often the only health care available, in urban areas, they serve \nMedicaid patients and uninsured who have no other access to services. I have \nsubmitted my written testimony (Exhibit M).  \n \nJOELLE GUTMAN DODSON (Washoe County Health District): \nWe  are  in  support  of  S.B.  379.  This  bill  is  good  for  public  health  and  for \nNevada. \n \nCODY  PHINNEY  (Deputy  Administrator,  Division  of  Health  Care  Financing  and \nPolicy, Department of Health and Human Services): \nWe are neutral on S.B. 379. The Department of Health and Human Services is \nconvinced this bill would allow the availability of this data to be beneficial to the \nprimary  care  office  and  its  efforts  toward  those  designations  for  health \nprofessional shortage areas. We are certain this data and the ability to analyze it \nwould allow us to get health professional services from people who look and \nsound like residents in those areas in a much better way than we can at this \ntime. We have the Office of Analytics on board to help with any concerns about \ndata privacy and on standby to help with any amendment. \n \nDAN MUSGROVE (Chiropractic Physicians' Board of Nevada): \nWe are neutral on S.B. 379. Everyone is interested in the confidentiality of this \ninformation which should not flow through the individual professional boards. \nOur amendment, Exhibit J, states the data should go directly to the Director of \nDHHS. Whatever portal the Director creates, we could easily figure out a way to \nverify that applicants or members of our boards have registered. It takes the \nboards out of the middle and provides further protection for confidential data. \n \nJOAN HALL (Nevada Rural Hospital Partners Foundation): \nWe support S.B. 379. This bill supports workforces we have been working on \nfor many years. This data will help underserved areas and have more accurate \ninformation about practice locations impacting service to people. \n \nSUSAN FISHER (State Board of Osteopathic Medicine): \nWe are neutral on S.B. 379. Our Board has not met in an open meeting to take \na formal position on this bill. We proposed an amendment, Exhibit K, as did the \nBoard  of  Medical  Examiners  whom  you  will  hear  from.  We  do  not  want \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nconfidential  information  given  to  us  because  it  could  cause  a  question  if  a \nprovider is denied a license because of something in his or her background or \ncriminal behavior. The proposed amendment would have the data go directly to \nDHHS, whether through a link on our website directly to DHHS or otherwise. \nWe would be agnostic on the language, whether you use our language or a \ncombination  thereof  from  the  Chiropractic  Board  and  Board  of  Medical \nExaminers. We did submit a fiscal note on this but do not know what it will cost \nto have information technology provide a link for us to the website. If there are \ncosts for additional staff time, we will have to estimate the fiscal note. \n \nKEITH LEE (Board of Medical Examiners): \nWe  are  neutral  on  S.B.  379.  We  have  submitted  a  proposed  amendment, \nExhibit L, and statement in neutral (Exhibit N). As my colleagues have testified, \nwe are close to the same language on a proposed amendment. We have a \nnewly installed state-of-the-art licensing and relicensing system. We can put a \nhyperlink  in  the  licensed  application  taking  the  applicant  directly  to  the \nDHHS survey. We will work with everyone to ensure this bill is passed and gets \nthe requested information to DHHS from our licensees while removing us from \nbeing the middle recipient, which could expose us to lawsuits based upon the \nknowledge of the information we have received. \n \nANTONINA CAPURRO, DMD (State Dental Health Officer, Division of Public and \nBehavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services): \nWe are neutral on S.B. 379. The Nevada Oral Health Program is committed to \nimproving the oral and overall health and well-being of Nevadans. To meet this \ngoal,  the  Program  puts  priority  on  the  present  and  future  needs  of  the \npopulation  and  dental  profession.  Reliable  data  is  limited  to  provider-patient \nratios identifying a lack of service after the fact. This does not provide real-time \ndata for long-term planning that accounts for changes in the dental workforce \nsuch as retirement needs, shifts in practice types and long-term retention in the \nState.  Intentions  to  accurately  monitor  and  gather  data  on  the  supply  of \ncompetent  oral  health  professionals  that  inform  the  Oral  Health  Program's \ndecisions are critical to ensure access to care for vulnerable and underserved \npopulations. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will now close the hearing on S.B. 379 and open the hearing on S.B. 376. \n \nSENATE BILL 376: Revises provisions relating to child welfare. (BDR 38-503) \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nSENATOR JAMES OHRENSCHALL (Senatorial District No. 21): \nI was lucky to chair the Legislative Committee on Child Welfare and Juvenile \nJustice. We came up with recommendations for ten bill draft requests (BDRs) as \nwell as letters on important issues affecting Nevada's children in our report \n(Exhibit  O).  Almost  all  of  our  recommendations  came  back  with  unanimous \nvotes with bipartisan support. One of the recommendations is S.B. 376. \n \nA concern was brought forth to the Committee when an allegation of abuse and \nneglect of a child occurs. Under law, the allegation is either substantiated or \nunsubstantiated. Many of the men and women who are tasked with protecting \nour children in Nevada felt this did not tell the whole story in terms of looking at \nwhat might have happened to a child in the past. The person evaluating the \nchild needs to know about other factors and the child's circumstances. That is \nthe genesis of this bill. Clark County has worked hard with other jurisdictions \nand written an amendment (Exhibit P) to this bill. \n \nMS. JACOB: \nWe will go through a quick presentation and Timothy Burch will go through the \ncategories  Clark  County  is  proposing  to  add  to  Nevada  law  through  the \namendment, Exhibit P. The amendment is a product of working with our other \nwelfare agency partners, and the language is a consensus of all. \n \nTIMOTHY BURCH (Administrator, Human Services, Clark County): \nI  will  go  through  the  presentation  (Exhibit  Q)  and  the  importance  of  the \nproposed  changes.  The  purpose  of  child  welfare  is  to  promote  the  safety, \npermanency and well-being of children and help make sure families can take \ncare  of  those  children  properly.  When  they  cannot,  child  welfare  finds \npermanency options with family or through adoption. \n \nOne  of  the  most  important  functions  we  can  serve  ensures  the  safety  of \nchildren is done properly through the investigation and disposition of reports of \nchild abuse and neglect. These case dispositions help in many ways. They help \nframe the interventions performed with these families and children, and they \ninform future investigations, both for child welfare and law enforcement, about \nthe outcome or disposition of these cases if their substantiations go into the \nCentral  Repository  for  Nevada  Records  of  Criminal  History.  These  Central \nRepository  records  help  to  conduct  investigations,  provide  appropriate \ntreatments  and,  most  importantly,  screen  people's  backgrounds  who  are \nentrusted with the care of children and the elderly according to NRS 432B.100. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nSubstantiated  dispositions  determine  reasonable  cause  to  believe  abuse  or \nneglect occurred and the alleged perpetrator is responsible for said abuse or \nneglect. Unsubstantiated dispositions mean a determination was unable to be \nmade through insufficient evidence or the inability to determine whether the \nalleged perpetrator was responsible for the abuse or neglect. \n \nThe proposal to amend NRS 432B.300, subsection 6 adds two case dispositions \nin addition to the categories of substantiated and unsubstantiated—\"unable to \ncomplete\"  and  \"administrative  closure\"—and  changes  the  standard  of  proof \nfrom \"reasonable cause to believe\" to \"preponderance.\" This is in alignment \nwith State regulations and policies. \n \nMS. JACOB: \nIn the Clark County amendment, Exhibit P, we are proposing to change a report \ndisposition from \"unable to complete\" to \"unable to locate or contact.\" The \ndefinition of unable to locate or contact is what Mr. Burch said; however, we \nneed to clear this with the child welfare agencies.  \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIn the language being struck, is there a reason why we are not seeing the \ncategory \"unable to determine?\" \n \nSENATOR OHRENSCHALL: \nThat  language  is  in  the  Texas  statutory  scheme  and,  although  part  of  the \noriginal amendment, it did not reach consensus in the proposed amendment. \n \nAMBER HOWELL (Director of Human Services, Washoe County): \nWe support S.B. 376.  \n \nALEXIS  TUCEY  (Deputy  Administrator,  Division  of  Child  and  Family  Services, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nWe are neutral on S.B. 376. We appreciate the changes regarding improvements \nfor  the  child  welfare  agencies,  serving  the  populations  in  Nevada  for  this \nparticular group and utilizing the information for needed changes and seeing the \ntrue picture of what is happening with our youth. \n \nMS. BERTSCHY:  \nThe Washoe County Public Defender's Office is in neutral on S.B. 376. My \noffice represents parents who are involved in neglect and abuse actions. Our \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \nonly concern left is to ensure the new designations for disposition categories are \nnot  reported  to  the  Central  Repository.  We  want  to  ensure  only  the \nsubstantiated  designations  are  reported  because  these  do  have  significant \nconsequences in terms of obtaining employment, housing and social services. It \nis our understanding the intent of this bill is that the unsubstantiated, unable to \nlocate  or  contact,  or  administrative  closure  categories  will  not  have  a  legal \nimpact on parents. \n \nMS. JACOB: \nIt  is  our  understanding  only  substantiated  dispositions  are  reported  to  the \nCentral  Repository.  However,  if  it  will  alleviate  concerns  from  the \nWashoe County Public Defender's Office, we are amenable to adding language \nto the amendment. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will now close the hearing on S.B. 376. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nI will open the hearing on S.B. 391. \n \nSENATE BILL 391: Revises provisions relating to dentistry. (BDR 40-455) \n \nSENATOR JULIA RATTI (Senatorial District No. 13): \nI  am  presenting  a  bill  that  was  one  of  the  ten  BDRs  recommended  by  the \nLegislative Committee on Health Care. This bill is about oral health in Nevada \nand its status, which is not good. Dr. Antonina Capurro, State Dental Health \nOfficer, did a lot of work to find best practices, look at what other states are \ndoing and come forward with a number of ideas on how to improve the status \nof oral health in Nevada. Some of those ideas cost money; by the time we \npresented at the Interim Committee, we were in a pandemic, and the impact of \nthe pandemic on the budget became clear. \n \nDr. Capurro and I discussed ways to help strengthen oral health in Nevada. We \nlooked at three significant concepts. First was an insurance concept, dental loss \nratio and how to ensure we have a good balanced approach while patients get \nthe  most  from  their  insurance.  Second,  we  looked  to  see  if  we  were  well \nsituated to use oral health providers to the highest and best of their ability in an \nemergency capacity and the infrastructure built around emergencies. Third was \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \nteledentistry  and  State  laws  regarding  teledentistry.  The  Interim  Committee \nasked we move forward with those three things. \n \nThe insurance piece became quite complicated. In the amendment (Exhibit R), all \nsections of the bill related to the dental loss ratio were removed. There are no \ninsurance components in this bill. However, the teledentistry and the emergency \nresponder pieces are strong. We also looked at the licensing requirements for \nthe  two  professional  positions  in  DHHS,  which  are  the  State  Dental  Health \nOfficer  and  State  Public  Health  Dental  Hygienist,  and  changed  some  of  the \nlicensing requirements in an effort to give the State better capacity for recruiting \nefforts. \n \nThe bill includes teledentistry, emergency providers and changes to the licensing \nrequirements for the top oral health professionals in our State. Dr. Capurro will \nwalk you through what the bill accomplishes. \n \nDR. CAPURRO: \nI am joined by Jessica Woods, Interim State Public Health Dental Hygienist. The \nobjective  of  the  bill  is  to  adapt  to  the  landscape  of  oral  health  which  has \nchanged  as  a  result  of  the  pandemic  and  to  create  infrastructure  ensuring \naccess to dental care for all Nevadans. Many of the lessons learned during the \npandemic include the expansion of teledentistry which has been used without a \nframework,  as  well  as  the  inclusion  of  dental  professionals  as  emergency \nresponders. We can and should use these lessons learned to frame the future. \nThis  bill  will  establish  the  framework  for  teledentistry  to  reduce  traditional \nbarriers to care, foster equality, adapt an innovative service model and define \nthe education and training required for an oral health professional to respond to \na public health disaster or state of emergency. It will also create a Committee \non Dental Emergency Management.  \n \nThe three key goals are to sustain the teledentistry services that have become a \nnew  delivery  method  to  increase  access  to  care.  We  want  to  expand  the \nhealthcare  workforce  available  as  a  search  support  for  major  disasters, \npandemics,  forensic  identification  and  administrative  readiness  planning.  We \nalso want to prepare for any future public health emergencies or disasters by \ncreating the Committee on Dental Emergency Management. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nA late-coming amendment submitted by Jesse Wadhams of the Nevada Hospital \nAssociation (Exhibit S) is a minor friendly amendment to how information is \ndisseminated to patients. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nDoes this bill have a fiscal note? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nWe have not received the fiscal note on this bill yet; however, based upon \ncontent remaining in the bill, there could be a modest fiscal note. \n \nDR. CAPURRO: \nThe  Oral  Health  Program  would  absorb  any  costs  associated  with  the \nCommittee on Dental Emergency Management. There would be no fiscal note. \n \nMATTHEW ROBINSON (Liberty Dental Plan): \nWe  support  S.B.  391.  Liberty  Dental  Plan  is  the  State  dental  benefits \nadministrator for children on Medicaid in Clark and Washoe Counties. We are \nproud to employ over 200 people in Clark County as we work to ensure Nevada \nhas access to the best possible dental care. \n \nWe have made efforts to mitigate some of the worst impacts of the pandemic \nover  the  last  year,  which  include  providing  6,000  dental  kits  to  children  in \nWashoe and Clark Counties and building out teledentistry services to ensure our \nkids did not fall behind on their oral health. We chose providers over profit and \ndid  not  retroactively  bill  them  for  the  6  percent  rate  cut  mandated  by  the \nLegislative Special Session. \n \nIn an effort to alleviate emergency rooms (ER), we developed a program so \npatients  with  oral  pain  did  not  tie  up  ER  staff  with  issues  which  might  be \naddressed in other ways. Liberty Dental Plan teamed up with the University of \nNevada,  Las  Vegas  (UNLV),  School  of  Dental  Medicine  to  launch  the \nUNLV Children's Dental Prevention Clinic in January. This is a small part of \nwhat we do, and we are proud of the work we have done in Nevada to provide \nthe best dental care in the market. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 27 \n \nHELEN FOLEY (Delta Dental): \nWe support S.B. 391. Delta Dental is the largest dental insurance company in \nthe Country, serving 36 million patients. During Covid-19, we were quick to \nembrace and support teledentistry. This has been through encouraging the use \nof teledentistry by our dentists in all states where it is legal and supporting \nefforts in other states like Nevada to clear any obstacles. This is in addition to \nthe measures we have taken during the pandemic to support our providers, \ncustomers, enrollees and communities through substantial financial assistance.  \n \nANNETTE LINCICOME (Nevada Dental Hygienists Association): \nWe support S.B. 391. I am an actively licensed, registered dental hygienist in \nNevada speaking on behalf of the Nevada Dental Hygienists Association. We \nhave submitted supporting testimony (Exhibit T). \n \nVILAS SASTRY, DMD (Chief Executive Officer, Teledentistry.com): \nWe  support  S.B.  391.  Over  the  last  several  years,  we  have  worked  with \npartners  to  create  and  deploy  a  solution  helping  countless  Nevadans  and \nincreasing access to care. \n \nEDDIE ABLESER (Nevada Dental Association): \nWe support S.B. 391.  \n \nJESSE WADHAMS (Nevada Hospital Association): \nWe are neutral on S.B. 391. The hospital emergency department is an incredibly \nbusy  place  and  focused  on  emergent  care.  The  amendment  would  help  us \noperationalize  the  goals  of  the  legislation.  We  have  submitted  a  conceptual \namendment, Exhibit S. \n \n \n \nRemainder of page intentionally left blank; signature page to follow. \n   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 1, 2021 \nPage 28 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe will close the hearing on S.B. 391.

(Director,  Policy  and  Programs/Oregon \nPrescription Drug Program, Oregon Health Authority): \nI  will  provide  background  on  the  Northwest  Prescription  Drug \nConsortium (Exhibit  P),  where  the  consortium  came  from  and  what  our \nexperience has been in Oregon and Washington. The most important thing is the \nannual market check on the rates, fees and guarantees. We are transparent. It is \nour goal to get the lowest-cost prescriptions for our program and participants. \n \nSpread  elimination  is  a  critical  element  in  cost  management.  Spread  occurs \nwhen pharmacy benefit management can hold a contract with a pharmacy by \nestablishing  a  rate  of  payment  for  drugs  and  holds  a  second  contract  with \ninsurers for a rate paid for those medications. \n \nThe consortium is designed to meet the needs of the public sector. We serve \nsome private entities but have multiple programs which can offer solutions to \nanyone. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nBETH  SLAMOWITZ,  Pharm.D.  (Senior  Policy  Advisor  on  Pharmacy,  Nevada \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nI will read from my written remarks (Exhibit Q). This bill authorizes nonprofits \nand  for-profit  private  entities  to  join  interstate  and  intrastate  purchasing \ncoalitions. \n \nSENATOR DONATE: \nThere is a conceptual amendment (Exhibit R) to the bill. \n \nOur  Public  Employees'  Benefits  Program  can  enter  into  an  agreement  if  it \nchooses. This bill goes beyond Medicaid, Public Employees' or current State or \nlocal government entities. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThis bill came from the Committee to Conduct an Interim Study Concerning the \nCosts of Prescription Drugs. The amendment essentially says please disregard \nthe bill. Our intent is to add the groups referenced in the amendment. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIs there a point at which the number of lives makes the program feasible? What \nis the point for tipping the economies of scale? \n \nDR. DOUGLASS: \nWe started small and grew to afford and avail ourselves of discounts. We have \nbuilt  considerations  into  contracting  for  economies  of  scale.  As  we  grow, \nadministrative fees will be reduced. At certain group sizes, there will be more \naggressive pricing and our position will improve.  \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nTo summarize, as you grow, are you finding the value and savings, forcing all \nrebates  to  come  to  the  consumer?  Rebates  are  not  being  captured  by  the \nmiddleman and not benefiting the user of those medications. Is that a big area \nwhere you are finding savings? \n \nDR. DOUGLASS: \nIt is a considerable one. Are you suggesting the rebates go back to consumers? \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nNo, not directly to the consumer, but its value goes into administering the plan. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nDR. DOUGLASS: \nThat is correct. The rebate revenue will be passed through to the insurer. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIs the product data management (PDM) a fixed administrative rate? \n \nDR. DOUGLASS: \nThat is correct. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWhat other categories are you able to find savings for the $169 million you \nidentified? Is it efficient purchasing power? \n \nDR. DOUGLASS: \nOther areas of capturing savings are on the administrative fee side. As we \ngrow, we are able to reduce those per claim on a per-member per-month basis, \ndepending  on  what  the  plan  chooses.  We  consistently  require  our  PDM  to \nnegotiate market rates. Our discounts are competitive in the marketplace.  \n \nOur group price online (GPO) savings allow state entities that purchase and take \npossession of medications to benefit from the GPO relationship and lower costs. \nThe individual prescription discount card benefit can save on prescriptions. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIs the amendment to delete the existing provision of S.B. 396 and authorize \nnonprofit and for-profit private entities to join interstate and intrastate coalitions \nfor prescription drugs? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe  can  do  that  for  governmental  agencies  but  not  agencies  listed  in  the \namendment. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nUnder the proposed amendment, would the nonprofits and for-profits have to be \nin partnership with a Nevada State agency to join an out-of-state coalition, or \ncould they do that independently? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nDR. SLAMOWITZ: \nThey could join independently. The intent is to allow groups to cross state lines \nand coordinate. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWhat is to prevent a private entity from crossing state lines? \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nA private entity can enter into an agreement with another private entity across \nstate lines. This bill would allow those agreements across state lines to include \ngovernmental and private entities inside and outside Nevada. \n \nMedicare and Medicaid can enter into agreements with other governmental and \nprivate entities, but other private entities inside Nevada could not enter into \nthose agreements. This bill would allow a Nevada private entity to join those \nagreements with public and private entities in other states and public entities in \nNevada. \n \nBONNIE MACQUARRIE: \nWhen I became sick, my doctor told me about a program that a manufacturer \nhad to help patients. The difference in cost saved my savings. People who need \nexpensive medications before being eligible for Medicare need these plans. \n \nMAYA HOLMES (Culinary Health Fund): \nWe support S.B. 396. It is needed to leverage the State's purchasing power by \nincluding public and private entities to secure prescription drugs at reasonable \ncosts. A purchasing coalition  is more essential as the result of COVID-19's \nfinancial impact on the State's economy and budget. \n \nSTACIE SASSO (Executive Director, Health Services Coalition): \nCreating a purchasing coalition is another step forward in achieving affordable \nhealthcare access. The State needs to make changes to positively impact the \neconomy and budget. \n \nNANCY CLARKE: \nI worked in the insurance industry for more than 20 years and watched as the \ncare costs became a crisis when driven by the cost of prescription drugs. We hit \nthe Medicare donut hole when we pay almost the full cost of prescription drugs \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nfor several months. Too many people are choosing to be sick because the cost \nof medication is too high. \n \nMAXMILLIAN LOWE: \nThis  would  help  Nevadan's  lower  the  cost  of  health  care  in  order  to  help \nthemselves.  \n \nAMY KOO (One APIA Nevada): \nBy lowering drug costs, we encourage Asian Americans to seek medical care \nand affordable health insurance.  \n \nRABBI BENJAMIN ZOBER: \nI support S.B. 396. Increasing access to health care is vital and a community \nobligation.  Sickness  is  not  a  divine  punishment.  As  a  community,  we  can \nprovide access to health care. \n \nBARRY GOLD (AARP Nevada): \nPrescription drugs are one of the main drivers of the increase in healthcare \ncosts. Lifesaving drugs do not work if you cannot afford to purchase them. \nAmerica should not be paying the highest drug costs in the world. This will \nlower the cost of prescription drugs to the consumers. \n \nAMBER FALGOUT (Manager, Northern Nevada Battle Born Progress): \nI have submitted my statement (Exhibit S) in writing. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe will close the hearing on S.B. 396 and open the hearing on S.B. 201. \n \nSENATE BILL 201: Requires licensing of pharmaceutical sales representatives. \n(BDR 54-444) \n \nSENATOR FABIAN DONATE (Senatorial District No. 10): \nI will read from my presentation (Exhibit T) of S.B. 201. \n \nDR. SLAMOWITZ: \nI have written remarks (Exhibit U) to present. \n \n \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nSENATOR DONATE: \nThe conceptual amendment (Exhibit V) provides the fee for licensure and how \nthese fees will be used. \n \nSTEPHANIE  WOODARD,  PSY.D.  (Medical  Epidemiologist  Senior  Advisor  on \nBehavioral Health, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, Department of \nHealth and Human Services): \nOver the past six years, I have had the opportunity to work with communities \nand  families  impacted  by  the  opioid  crisis.  It  has  been  established  that  the \nopioid crisis in Nevada was driven by overprescribing the opioid medication.  \n \nI have been asked to provide additional context to the scope of overprescribing \nin Nevada and the resulting fatalities. In 2011, the national average for states \nfor prescribing opioids was 68 prescriptions for every 100 people. In Nevada, \nthe  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  estimated  there  were \n100 prescriptions  for  100  people.  In  2016,  4  of  Nevada's  counties  had \nprescribing rates greater than 125 prescriptions per 100 people. As Senator \nDonate mentioned, the opioid crisis has resulted in high rates for emergency \nroom and inpatient care. Opioid overdoses have resulted in over 4,500 overdose \ndeaths in Nevada since 2010. \n \nTo address the mounting overdoses and high rates of prescribing, the Nevada \nLegislature passed A.B. No. 474 of the 79th Session which put forth prescribing \nguidelines  for  controlled  substances  including  opioids.  During  our  work  to \ndevelop that bill, we spoke with prescribers across the State and discussed the \ndrivers for the high rates of prescribing. We heard from prescribers who felt \npressured to prescribe by assessing and treating pain as the fifth vital sign. \nAggressive marketing strategies promoted opioid prescribing as not only safe \nbut necessary in managing a patient's pain.  \n \nWe  have  made  progress  in  addressing  overprescribing  since  implementing \nA.B. No. 474 of the 79th Session and have seen rates of prescribing decrease \nby 40 percent. Additional measures to reduce Nevada's risk of being impacted \nby similar marketing strategies in the future are needed to protect our citizens. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIf we want to get rid of the opioid crisis, we need to act on what we have done \nin Nevada with A.B. No. 474 of the 79th Session, by registering those who are \npushing the opioids, not every pharmaceutical technician or representative. We \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nare going up in fentanyl and heroin deaths. We are not doing the right thing by \nregistering every pharmaceutical representative.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWas the opioid crisis the most-documented and best-studied example of the \nimpact of marketing on behavior?  \n \nSENATOR DONATE: \nBased  on  the  information  shared  on  the  opioid  crisis,  we  know  the \nconsequences that could arise in the pharmaceutical industry with marketing \nand its association with prescribing medications. The opioid epidemic was a \nclear example highlighted in the past few years.  \n \nAnother study conducted by JAMA Internal Medicine mentioned physicians who \nreceive email promote the drug interests at higher rates of prescribing certain \ndrugs. Requiring the licensure of pharmaceutical representatives in Nevada will \nallow physicians the necessary tool to double-check and report any potential \nabuse or wrongdoing they observe and to ensure the representatives are being \nheld to the highest standard. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nOne  of  the  reasons  we  have  pharmaceutical  representations  is  to  use \nappropriate medicines correctly. It is not unusual for a new drug to outperform \nan old drug. Physicians are amendable to the educational experience they get \nwith drug representatives. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe pharmaceutical representatives have become a part of the care team, but \nthat part is blind to the public and the State. With every healthcare profession \nwe have a majority who work within the ethics, but some do not. The data from \na transparency standpoint shows members of the team need to be known and \ntrained to be included in the patient mix. \n \nMS. LOWE: \nI support the bill because licensing pharmaceutical representatives will help with \ntransparency  between  doctors,  prescribers  and  patients.  We  should  regulate \nmarketing because a pill does not always make an issue better.  \n \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nRANDI LAMPERT: \nI am a pediatrician in Las Vegas. I support this package of bills. I have seen the \nharm  prescribing  drugs  has  caused  entire  families.  This  bill  creates \naccountability.  My  patients  and  their  families  deserve  to  know  sales \nrepresentatives are held accountable. \n \nJANE HORVATH (Horvath Health Policy): \nLicensed  professionals  met  standards  for  knowledge,  training  and  business \nbehavior. Drug marketing can have significant effect on our health, safety and \nspending.  This  bill  sets  some  basic  standards  for  sales  representatives' \nbehaviors  and  delegate's  development  of  regulations  to  the  Department  of \nHealth and Human Services which can have additional standards for knowledge \nand ethics. \n \nMS. FALGOUT: \nDrug  companies  must  be  held  to  a  higher  level  of  accountability.  This  will \nrequire the registration of all drug representatives and set a higher bar for ethical \nbehavior. We need transparency in Nevada. \n \nMS. SASSO: \nPharmaceutical representatives are one of the main sources of drug marketing \nto  physician  groups.  They  have  a  goal  of  increasing  utilization  of  their \nbrand-named  drugs,  increasing  sales  for  the  drug  company  and  potentially \nsteering  patients  to  higher  out-of-pocket  copayments  because  of  use  of  a \nname-brand  drug  in  place  of  a  generic  product.  Requiring  licensure  of \npharmaceutical representatives in the State will protect patients and physicians. \n \nMS. HOLMES: \nPharmaceutical  representatives  play  a  significant  role  for  drug  company \nmarketing of  brand-named  drugs.  They provide information to  physicians on \ndrugs, but a key piece of their position is increasing drug company sales which \ncan result in steering patients to drugs with higher prices. Physicians are often \nnot aware of healthcare costs. The pharmaceutical industry spends billions on \ndirect marketing to physicians. To protect patients and physicians, it makes \nsense to require licensure, set practice standards and prohibit pharmaceutical \nrepresentatives from engaging in misleading marketing. \n \nASHER LISEC (Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America): \nI have submitted a written statement (Exhibit W) in opposition to this bill. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nTransparency says accountability. Right now, the representatives register. But if \na complaint occurs, is there any process to deal with that complaint? What \npower does DHHS have if there is a complaint? \n \nDR. SLAMOWITZ: \nThe Department is simply a depository of information. This includes who the \nrepresentatives visit and if gifts are greater than $10, what they are and what \ncategory  they  fall  into.  There  is  nothing  in  terms  of  regulatory  authority, \ndisciplinary action and accountability in terms of requirements for education or \nethics standards. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe will close the hearing on S.B. 201 and open the hearing on S.B. 364. \n \nSENATE BILL 364: Revises provisions relating to emergency medical care for a \nvictim of sexual assault or attempted sexual assault. (BDR 40-1004) \n \nSENATOR MELANIE SCHEIBLE (Senatorial District No. 9): \nI am joined by Talia Pellegrino who will go over the details of the bill and explain \nits  value.  This  bill  requires  that  emergency  rooms  provide  emergency \ncontraceptives to victims of sexual assault.  \n \nThis is not in response to anybody who has failed to treat a victim of sexual \nassault with dignity or respect. This is to ensure Nevadans receive the highest \nquality of health care in Nevada hospitals. \n \nTALIA PELLEGRINO (Access to Healthcare Network): \nI will read the written presentation (Exhibit X) for S.B. 364. \n \nKATIE ROBBINS (Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada): \nVictims  of  sexual  assault  should  have  access  to  safe  and  time-sensitive \nemergency  contraceptives  at  emergency  rooms.  Rather  than  having  to  seek \nemergency contraceptives from a separate provider at a later time, S.B. 364 \nwould allow victims to get the care they need quickly and safely. Emergency \ncontraceptives are safe and used to prevent pregnancy, not end one.  \n \n \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nMARLENE LOCKARD (Nevada Women's Lobby): \nThis important bill makes it easier and more accessible for victims of sexual \nassault  to  access  emergency  contraception,  which  is  not  an  abortion.  It \nprevents a pregnancy from taking place and is most effective when taken within \n24  hours  of  the  implant  from  the  sexual  encounter.  Victims  have  faced  an \nintense trauma, and they must do a number of things after the encounter to \nprevent  pregnancy.  We  support  any  measures  taken  to  make  this  process \neasier. This bill will allow a victim of a sexual assault to get necessary medicine \nwithout having to go to a second location.  \n \nMS. LOWE: \nI support S.B. 364, but I would like to know if there is anything in the bill for \npeople with disabilities to explain to them what has happened and what they \nneed to do to report the action. \n \nMS. FALGOUT: \nI  am  submitting  my  written  support  on  behalf  of  Battle  Born  Progress \n(Exhibit Y). \n \nCAROLINE MELLO ROBERSON (NARAL Pro-Choice America): \nMy written testimony in support (Exhibit Z) has been submitted. \n \nSERENA EVANS (Nevada Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual Violence): \nI  want  to  echo  what  Ms.  Roberson  said.  The  Coalition  was  involved  with \nA.B. No. 124 of the 80th Session, which established that the Division of Public \nand Behavioral Health create a pamphlet that all victims and survivors of sexual \nassault receive. The piece of emergency contraception was originally in this bill \nbut was amended out. \n \nThis bill is important because the first point of contact for victims of sexual \nassault  is  usually  an  emergency  room  to  seek  medical  care.  They  are  then \ndirected to an exam facility or told to report to law enforcement to get the \nemergency contraception. It is important that victim survivors are treated with \ncompassion and given access to emergency contraception whether or not they \nchoose to submit themselves to an exam. Victims from rural communities have \nto travel to a nonvictim facility when all they want is emergency contraception. \nAll  hospitals  should  have  the  emergency  contraception  on  hand  and  should \ndispense the medication when requested. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWhat is contraception? Does another definition clarify the use of an IUD? \n \nSENATOR SCHEIBLE: \nThis  bill  addresses  emergency  contraceptives  which  includes  hormonal \ncontraceptives taken within 24 to 72 hours of unprotected sexual contact to \nprevent pregnancy. Other types exist that are not addressed by this bill, and I \nam not sure they would be utilized in an emergency situation. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI think emergency contraception is an oral contraceptive such as Plan B. If it is \nother than that, I would like know. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs there a definition for emergency contraception? \n \nSENATOR SCHEIBLE: \nThe bill does not define an emergency contraceptive.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nDoes it include anything other than the birth control pill? \n \nSENATOR SCHEIBLE: \nThe bill, as drafted, is any emergency contraceptive. In most cases that would \nmean the morning-after pill. If a woman who presents at the emergency room \nhas experienced an assault, is seen by a qualified professional and wants to get \nan IUD that day instead of taking an oral contraceptive, that would also meet \nthe requirements of the bill.  The doctor could insert an IUD in lieu of offering \nher the emergency contraceptive. That would not allow someone who is not \nqualified and authorized to insert an IUD. \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nIn section 2, subsection 5, paragraph (a), \"emergency contraception is defined \nto mean methods of birth control which, when administered within a specified \nperiod after intercourse, may prevent pregnancy from occurring.\" If an IUD fits \nwithin that definition, it would be included in the definition. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWith no amendment to the bill, I will entertain a motion on the bill? \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER MOVED TO DO PASS S.B. 364. \n \n  SENATOR HARRIS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \n  THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe will close the hearing on S.B. 364.  \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nWe will open the hearing on S.B. 380. \n \nSENATE  BILL  380:  Revises  provisions  governing  the  reporting  of  data \nconcerning the prices of prescription drugs. (BDR 40-445) \n \nSENATOR JULIA RATTI (Senatorial District No. 13): \nOne  of  the  conversations  of  the  Committee  to  conduct  an  Interim  Study \nConcerning the Costs of Prescription Drugs was about how we take the next \nstep on transparency. We were hearing from constituents about problems with \ncosts. We know how pharmaceutical representatives interact with providers and \nhow pricing is set.  \n \nTwo things were recommended from the Interim study. First is to expand the \nuniverse of drugs we are looking at and then to narrow down to drugs that cost \na certain amount of money and those that are growing in price. \n \nIn the conceptual amendment of the bill (Exhibit AA), the Department of Health \nand Human Services compiles an annual list of prescription drugs costing more \nthan $40 for a course of treatment, whether for a month or a single shot, \nwherein the wholesale acquisition cost of those drugs increases by 10 percent \nor more. \n \nThe second thing the bill does is include registration and transparency measures \nof the supply chain. The bill asks for reporting from some of the chains on the \ntop 25 drugs within their universe.  \n \nThere are many people involved in getting the drug from the manufacturer to \nthe patient.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nDR. SLAMOWITZ: \nI have written remarks (Exhibit AB) that I will cover. \n  \nSENATOR HARDY: \nA  month's  worth  of  medicine  costing  less  than  $40  would  be  unusual.  Is \neverything over $40 going to be studied or just the top 25? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThere are two parts to the bill. The first is applying transparency laws that \nalready exist for asthma and diabetes to another class of drugs which costs \nover $40 for a month of therapy and has 10 percent or more annual price \ngrowth. We are talking about the wholesale acquisition price. For those drugs \nwe would apply the transparency statutes we have for asthma and diabetes, \nrequiring  pharmaceutical  companies  to  report  the  same  things  we  currently \nrequire for asthma and diabetes. \n \nThe second thing is from third parties, like an insurance company. They spend \nmoney on the 25 top drugs so we can better see the supply chain. We are not \ntalking about information we are asking for from the pharmaceutical companies \nbut from the third parties. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nHow will the $30,000 administrative penalty, usually used for the General Fund, \nbe used? What is the fiscal note on this? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nWe did not put anything into statute for what the money could be used for, so \nit  just  went  into  an  account  and  has  been  sitting  there.  We  have  about \n$1 million in accumulated fines but have not had a use for the money stipulated \nby law. The amendment allows existing money to be used for furthering the \ntransparency efforts as well as any new fines collected. Staff needs to collect \nthe information, and we need the resources to keep the program going. \n \nI do not believe the fiscal note has been published on this bill yet. \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nWe heard S.B. 396 earlier. How does this mesh with that? \n \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThe  goal  of the  Interim Committee was to find  how to cap pharmaceutical \ncosts.  Senate  Bill  396  addresses  the  ability  for  state  governments  with \nMedicaid, nonprofits and private entities to remove the barriers so they can join \na coalition to increase their purchasing power.  \n \nSenate Bill 380 builds the transparency of pharmaceutical companies so the \nreports provide the input to show how they get to the pricing. We only know \nabout  asthma  and  diabetes  drugs.  If  we  expand  this,  we  will  know  about \nanother group of drugs based on their expense and price going up 10 percent or \nmore  a  year,  and  we  will  know  more  about  all  of  the  suppliers,  pharmacy \nbenefits managers, insurance companies and wholesalers. Each has a role to \nplay in adding to the price and can provide the additional information we want \nto learn about. We might see how the coalitions are interacting with all of the \nsupply chains in a more transparent way. \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nI keep hearing the prescription is for 30 days. Some places offer a 90-day \nsupply. Would 30 days be an absolute number, or is there flexibility for how \noften a person gets his or her prescription filled? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThis bill is talking about how to define another class of drugs. We are really \nconcerned with drugs going up in price. The course of therapy being 30 days \nwould  cost  at  least  $40  at  the  wholesale  price.  For  drugs  that  are \n$40 wholesale  and  have  gone  up  10  percent  or  more  in  the  last  year, \nmanufacturers will be subject to the law and have to start reporting on those \ndrugs.  \n \nThis is not about how much supply a patient gets; it is a way to define another \ngroup of drugs, if it costs enough to make a difference and is going up in price. \n \nMR. GOLD: \nAmericans should not pay the highest drug costs in the Nation. What is behind \nthe  cost  for  certain  drugs  or  the  increase  in  price  by  a  certain  amount? \nTypically, research and development are not the most expensive cost of a drug. \n \n \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \nMS. HOLMES: \nThe Culinary Health Fund provides health benefits to members of the Culinary \nWorkers Union and their dependents. A critical priority for us is providing quality \nand  affordable  health  care,  including  prescription  drugs.  By  requiring \ntransparency reporting from critical market participants in the drug supply chain, \npolicy makers will be able to see these participants, roll in drug prices and \nidentify the cost drivers. This reporting will ensure policy makers in the State \nmake data-driven decisions and end finger-pointing of who is to blame for the \nincreases in drug prices. \n \nYITZEL HERRERA: \nI am here in support of this bill. When I lost my job, the pharmacist told me I \nshould get a prescription savings club card. I heard about the cost of drugs \ngoing up, and I would not be able to afford them anymore. \n \nMS. LOCKARD: \nI am representing the Retired Public Employees of Nevada. We support this bill. \nOur seniors are hurting, and any help we can get with the pharmacy and drug \ncosts will help. \n \nPHILIP MALINAS: \nI am a Reno psychiatrist. I see my patients struggle to pay for the medications I \nprescribe for them. My patients see mysterious changes in price which always \nhappen with no warning or advance notice to my patients. \n \nMS. FALGOUT: \nI have submitted testimony (Exhibit AC) on behalf of Battle Born Progress in \nsupport of S.B. 380. \n \nBILL HEAD (Pharmaceutical Care Management Association): \nWe oppose this bill. We are mostly concerned with the terms of what is being \nrequired to report. Having the information posted publically can be hindering. \nStates  have  done  an  excellent  job  managing  the  proprietary  information  for \ndrugs and want to continue that as this expands the reporting requirements. \nThere is a need for public consumption. The Federal Trade Commission has \nwarned that giving out information that allows entities within the supply chain \nto see what others are charging, either directly or through reverse engineering \ndata, can actually result in higher drug costs.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \nMS. LISEC: \nI have submitted PhRMA opposition (Exhibit AD) to S.B. 380. \n \nLEAH LINDAHL (Healthcare Distribution Alliance): \nI have submitted my opposition (Exhibit AE) to S.B. 380. \n \nMS. SASSO: \nThe Health Services Coalition is neutral on S.B. 380. This will provide policy \nmakers  with  the  information  needed  to  make  better  decisions  to  support \npatients  in  the  community  who  struggle  with  the  affordability  of  their \nmedications. \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nWe will close the hearing on S.B. 380. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRemainder of page intentionally left blank; signature page to follow.   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 27 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nHearing nothing further, I will adjourn the meeting at 7:34 p.m. \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nDiane Rea, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 28 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nBegins \nExhibit \nBill   on  Witness / Entity  Description \nLetter \nPage \n  A  1    Agenda \nS.B. 5  B  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 40  C  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 61  D  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 96  E  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 158  F  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 175  G  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 188  H  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 205  I  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 211  J  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 251  K  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 305  L  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 379  M  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nA.B. 62  N  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 396  O  1  Senator Fabian Donate Testimony \nTrevor Douglass / \nS.B. 396  P  1  Prescription Drug  Presentation \nConsortium \nBeth Slamowitz / \nS.B. 396  Q  1  Department of Health  Written Remarks \nand Human Services \nS.B. 396  R  1  Senator Fabian Donate Conceptual Amendment \nAmber Falgout / Battle \nS.B. 396  S  1  Testimony \nBorn Progress \nS.B. 201  T  1  Senator Fabian Donate Testimony \nBeth Slamowitz / \nS.B. 201  U  1  Nevada Department of Written Remarks \nHealth and Human \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 6, 2021 \nPage 29 \n \nServices \nS.B. 201  V  1  Senator Fabian Donate Conceptual Amendment \nAsher Lisec / \nPharmaceutical \nS.B. 201  W  1  Research and  Statement in Opposition \nManufacturers of \nAmerica \nTalia Pellegrino / \nTestimony for Senator \nS.B. 364  X  1  Access to Healthcare \nMelanie Scheible \nNetwork  \nAmber Falgout / Battle \nS.B. 364  Y  1  Statement of Support \nBorn Progress \nCaroline Mello \nS.B. 364  Z  1  Roberson / NARAL  Statement of Support \nPro-Choice Nevada \nS.B. 380  AA  1  Senator Julia Ratti  Conceptual Amendment \nBeth Slamowitz / \nS.B. 380  AB  1  Department of Health  Written Remarks \nand Human Services \nAmber Falgout / Battle \nS.B. 380  AC  1  Statement of Support \nBorn Progress \nAsher Lisec / \nPharmaceutical \nS.B. 380  AD  1  Research and  Statement in Opposition \nManufacturers of \nAmerica \nLeah Lindahl / \nS.B. 380  AE  1  Healthcare Distribution Testimony \nAlliance \n ", "\nMINUTES OF THE \nSENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n \nEighty-first Session \nApril 8, 2021 \n \n \nThe  Senate  Committee  on  Health  and  Human  Services  was  called  to  order  by \nChair Julia Ratti at 3:37 p.m. on Thursday, April 8, 2021, Online.

(BDR 38-705) \n \nMS. COMLOSSY: \nI will read the summary of the bill and the amendments from the work session \ndocument (Exhibit C). \n \nJOANNA JACOB (Clark County): \nWe worked in collaboration with the State and Washoe County on this measure. \nThe biggest amendment deletes the sections in the bill that would have provided \nfor  the  involuntary  commitment  process.  This  is  because  the  receiving  centers \nproposed  in  the  bill  are  permissive.  The  sections  proposed  on  involuntary \ncommitment need some additional work. We are going to continue to work on that \nissue together during the Interim.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nSection 3 proposes moving the “receiving center” definition to Nevada Revised \nStatutes (NRS) 424 from NRS 432A, which is more the foster care section of the \nlaw. \n \nSection 6, subsection 2, paragraph (a) considers alternative placements in addition \nto the receiving center. There is a great deal of work going on by child welfare \nagencies on the issue of handling cases of children experiencing commercial and \nsexual  exploitation.  There  is  green  language  throughout  where  we  have  added \nalternative placements. \n \nThere  are  deletions  to  section  30  of  the  original  bill  as  to  the  involuntary \ncommitment process. The changes to NRS 432C.010 in the newly renumbered \nsection 16 were proposed to work on our screening process for children who are \nvictims of commercial sexual exploitation. The amendments were proposed to give \nus more flexibility. \n \nWe were looking to see if we could leverage any federal dollars or available funding \nto help assist child welfare agencies with the shift away from juvenile justice. \nLanguage in the amendment was designed to align processes allowing us to build, \nwhere available, access to federal Title IV-E of the Social Security Act funding. \n \nThe change at the end of the bill delays the implementation date where we relocate \nthe responsibility from the juvenile justice system to our child welfare agencies. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nFlexibility in creating receiving centers as a concept may be a tool we want to use. \nGreater flexibility to use some of the existing tools and momentum in the child \nwelfare movement will better connect us to Title IV-E funds as a funding source \nalong with Medicaid and local funding. It is about ensuring we get it right on \nTitle IV-E funding because this bill is about taking children out of the juvenile justice \nsystem and getting them into the child welfare system if they have been victims of \nsexual exploitation. \n \nMS. JACOB: \nWe are looking for all available funding sources.  \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nI am curious about the removal of the involuntary commitment provisions starting \nwith section 18. Can you speak to why that has been struck out? \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nBRIGID DUFFY (Clark County Office of the District Attorney): \nI made the determination to support pulling those sections of the bill at this time \nbecause work needs to go into those sections as far as getting a consensus. There \nwas some opposition during the hearing on the bill from community stakeholders \nwith the original language. If we get the date pushed out to 2023, we could come \ntogether during the Interim and create a solid involuntary commitment that protects \nthe child’s due process rights and allows for review hearings. \n \nFor the most part, this was a timing issue. If the bill passes and the date is pushed \nout to 2023, we should get this done during the Interim and make a solid plan. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWhat is the report pursuant to NRS 432C.110 in the newly renumbered section 17, \nsubsection 1, paragraph (c)? This seems like a significant expansion of an agency’s \nresponsibilities. \n \nMS. JACOB: \nThe report under NRS 432C.110 is when we receive outside reports of any time \nany person knows or has reasonable cause to believe a child is possibly the victim \nof commercial sexual exploitation. This is upon referral from outside of our child \nwelfare agency, and the report is given to our child welfare agency. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nI just wanted to make sure this was not a general report of abuse or neglect; that it \nwas more specific, and we were not doing a massive expansion. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nDuring  the  hearing  on  S.B.  274,  I  expressed  my  concerns  around  the  term \n“receiving center” and reiterate those concerns. Language matters, and what is \nimportant is that we take the model, not necessarily having to keep the name. I \nencourage  the  sponsors  to  continue  thinking  about  something  more \nperson-centered. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will entertain a motion on S.B. 274. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN MOVED TO AMEND AND DO PASS AS AMENDED \nS.B. 274. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the work session on S.B. 274 and open the work session on S.B. 275. \n \nSENATE  BILL  275:  Revises  provisions  relating  to  the  human  immunodeficiency \nvirus.

COMLOSSY: \nI will read the summary of the bill and the amendments from the work session \ndocument (Exhibit D). \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nI have concerns about the broad changes we are making to the county health \nauthorities’ ability to isolate and quarantine people as it relates to communicable \ndisease in an infection of AIDs and what that might do to their ability to fight global \npandemics or other crises that may arise. We have not had any discussion about \nthis. \n \nI have continued concerns about the change in burden on testing for our first \nresponders.

(BDR 40-445) \n \nMS. COMLOSSY: \nI will read the summary of the bill and the amendments from the work session \ndocument (Exhibit J). \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThere were significant conversations following the hearing on S.B. 380, and there \nis a lengthy amendment. \n \nBETH SLAMOWITZ (Senior Policy Advisor on Pharmacy, Department of Health and \nHuman Services): \nUnder the general amendment, there is an additional definition for rebate. \n \nSection 5 has been deleted in its entirety. \n \nIn section 6, subsection 2, paragraph (b), the number of units has been redefined \nas volume in wholesale acquisition cost units. Paragraph (f) adds the aggregate \ntotal amount of rebates and deletes the statement of discounts and other price \nconcessions. Paragraph (h) adds the term aggregate and deletes the total amount \nof rebates and discounts, dispensing fees and other fees. \n \nSections 7 and 8 were removed in their entirety. \n \nSection 10 remained the same as the original conceptual amendment heard during \nthe hearing on April 6. \n \nSection 11 remained the same as the original conceptual amendment heard during \nthe hearing on April 6. There were formatting changes only. \n \nSection 13, subsection 2, paragraph (a) was removed. The units were defined in \nsubsection  2,  paragraphs  (b)  and  (c)  as  wholesale  acquisition  cost  units. \nParagraphs (d) and (e) were removed; paragraph (f) adds the term aggregate in \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nterms of aggregate amount of all rebates and deletes discounts and other price \nconcessions.  Paragraphs  (k),  (l),  (m)  and  (n)  add  the  term  aggregate. \nParagraphs (p), (q), (r) and (s) were removed.  \n \nSection  16,  subsection  5  was  deleted  due  to  the  deletion  of  section  5,  and \nsubsection 12 was deleted due to section 7 being deleted. \n \nMs. Comlossy mentioned the changes to section 18 not noted in this amendment. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe  missed  an  amendment  attached  to  the  work  session  document,  Exhibit  J, \nwhere  the  fees  were  set  at  $30,000,  a  significant  raise  from  the  fees  in  the \nexisting law of $5,000. This amendment would take it back to $5,000. \n \nEverything Ms. Slamowitz went through shows a significant scaling back of the bill \nwhile leaving in some important concepts. These include expanding to the drugs of \nsignificant cost at $40 per wholesale acquisition price and 10 percent increase that \nyear so we could do additional transparency work on another class of drugs and \ncontinue to advance what we know as a State about how drug pricing is changing. \nIt does include retail pharmacy benefit managers (RPBMs) and wholesalers with \nsome transparency requirements. \n \nThe  transparency  requirements  are  more  modest  and  have  less  registration \nrequirements.  It  removes  insurers.  We  crosswalked  with  the  all-payer  claims \ndatabase (APCD) bill that was heard, so we will initially get that information from \nthe APCD. If that does not turn out to be the case as we are standing up this new \nsystem, we would come back in a subsequent session to have that conversation. It \nappears  the  transparency  requirements  of  the  APCD  make  the  insurance \nrequirements in this bill unnecessary. \n \nIt will make it less expensive as the fiscal notes were significant. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nSection 10 changes which medications now have to be reported; I read it as this is \nall drugs that meet those two triggers—a cost of more than $40 and an increase by \n10 percent in a year. Is that correct? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe  law  stays  the  same  for  asthma  and  diabetes  drugs.  When  I  speak  of  an \nadditional class, I should say an additional group of drugs. Instead of being defined \nby disease, those drugs would be defined by the wholesale acquisition cost and the \nincrease of 10 percent in a year. The bill started out with all drugs and narrowed \ndown to those. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nDo we know how many reports are expected? \n \nMS. SLAMOWITZ: \nIt is difficult to determine. The list of drugs we look at will be determined by the \nwholesale acquisition cost which must be more than $40 for a course of therapy; \nsection 10, subsection 1, paragraphs (a) and (b) define a course of therapy. There \nmust also be a 10 percent increase over one year or twice the net 10 percent \nincrease over two years. It will significantly increase the number of manufacturers \nwe  will  receive  reports  from.  In  addition,  the  bill  adds  wholesalers  as  well  as \nRPBMs, so we will have three reporting groups: wholesalers, manufacturers and \nRPBMs. \n \nWe were looking at potentially double to triple the amount of reports, but it will be \ndifficult  until  we  go  through  the  first  reporting  cycle  to  see  what  comes  in. \nObviously, prices change daily, if not hourly. That list may look different today than \nit will look a month from now. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWhere did you say the definition of a course of therapy was? \n \nMS. SLAMOWITZ: \nIn section 10, subsection 1, paragraphs (a) and (b) define a course of therapy as \neither the recommended daily dosage units of a prescription to its prescribing label \nas approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for 30 days or the \nrecommended daily dosage units of a prescription drug pursuant to its prescribing \nlabel as approved by the FDA for a normal course of treatment that is less than \n30 days. So a bottle of eye drops might not be a 30-day supply, it might be a \n5-day supply. What the FDA label calls for would be a course of therapy. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nFor instance, it may be an antibiotic you take for a week. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nMS. SLAMOWITZ: \nYes, it would be based on what the FDA has approved as far as the indication and \nthe course of treatment whether it be once a day or twice a day for 10 or 14 days. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI am equating that to someone who is an asthmatic who takes steroids. If you have \na bad asthma attack in February and another one in July, the course of therapy \nwould be whenever they prescribe those steroids to help expand the lungs. Is that \ncorrect? \n \nMS. SLAMOWITZ: \nYes. The course of therapy would be determined by the package label or insert. \nPeople take steroids for many indications. If the normal course of therapy for a \nparticular steroid states you should take it twice a day, we would look at what is \nrequired in terms of a 30-day supply of that particular medication, if it falls into the \npricing parameters. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will entertain a motion on S.B. 380. \n \nSENATOR  HARRIS  MOVED  TO  AMEND  AND  DO  PASS  AS  AMENDED \nS.B. 380. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE  MOTION  CARRIED.  (SENATORS  HARDY  AND  KIECKHEFER  VOTED \nNO.) \n \n* * * * * \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nI do not see what is going to be a deluge of data to the State driving cost savings \nto patients. Have we seen that through data we are already collecting on asthma \nand diabetes medications? Other bills not to be processed that came out of the \nInterim study may have had direct patient impact. I am not sure where our goals \nare on this. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nERIC ROBBINS (COUNSEL): \nSection 10 of the amendment in the work session document, Exhibit J, appeared to \ndelete the existing language about the list of drugs essential for treating asthma \nand diabetes and replaced that with the new criteria. Chair Ratti, you mentioned it \nwas your impression you thought we kept the asthma and diabetes language. Can I \nget clarification on the Committee’s intent? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nOur intent is to keep the asthma and diabetes language. \n \nMS. SLAMOWITZ: \nAsthma and diabetes language would be cast with the same net, so that is why the \nfirst statement under section 10, subsection 1 was deleted. This is looking at the \nentire universe of drugs and basing the requirements of the list on cost versus \nindication.  The  diabetes  and  asthma  medications  that  fall  under  those  cost \nrequirements would be included on this list. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIf they do not cost $40 or more for the wholesale acquisition price or have not \ngone up by 10 percent, would we not require the reporting in that year? \n \nMS. SLAMOWITZ: \nThe requirements that exist in legislation where we use the Consumer Price Index \n(CPI) would be similar. The same drugs would not fall on the list as they would fall \nunder the requirements for the $40 wholesale acquisition cost and the 10 percent \nincrease. It is a cleaner way to look at the cost of the drug than the CPI because \nthe CPI does not take into account all consumers. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThat  was  my  misunderstanding,  Mr.  Robbins;  the  way  it  is  written  in  the \namendment is the intent. \n \nI will close the work session on S.B. 380 and open the work session on S.B. 391. \n \nSENATE BILL 391: Revises provisions relating to dentistry. (BDR 40-455) \n \nMS. COMLOSSY: \nI will read the summary of the bill and the amendments from the work session \ndocument (Exhibit K). \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe amendment received after the hearing on April 1 ensures the positions relating \nto oral health were clearly defined and aligned with the status of the dental health \nofficers similarly to the status of chief medical officer. For our dental hygienists, \nthe language allows them to have outside work. I would like to note our dental \nhygienist works part time for the State, and statute disallows her from having \nadditional work outside of her part-time job with the State. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWe have three amendments and propose to adopt all three? \n \nMS. COMLOSSY: \nIt is the intent to adopt all three as they are each separate and distinct. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will entertain a motion on S.B. 391. \n \nSENATOR  HARDY  MOVED  TO  AMEND  AND  DO  PASS  AS  AMENDED \nS.B. 391. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the work session on S.B. 391 and open the work session on S.B. 396. \n \nSENATE BILL 396: Revises provisions relating to the purchasing of prescription \ndrugs. (BDR 38-443) \n \nMS. COMLOSSY: \nI will read the summary of the bill and the amendments from the work session \ndocument (Exhibit L). \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe had a two-line conceptual amendment to the bill, and there was confusion \nabout which part of NRS we were getting to. I asked Mr. Robbins to do Proposed \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nAmendment 3226 which is part of the work session document, Exhibit L. This \nshould give greater clarity to removing the barriers to the different versions of \ncoalitions partnering with each other to increase the purchasing leverage when it \ncomes to pharmaceuticals. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe pieces incorporated into section 1 of the amendment are what we said were \nallowed by a different piece of statute, and the provisions in section 3.3 are what \nwe need to do. Is this correct? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI asked Ms. Slamowitz, Ms. Comlossy, Mr. Robbins and Senator Donate to make \nsure  we  were  all  talking  about  the  same  thing.  This  is  the  result  of  that \nconversation. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nI was under the impression the State could enter into collaborative agreements with \nother states and territories and not need that piece of the proposed bill. \n \nMS. SLAMOWITZ: \nWhen  we  discussed  this,  we  realized  the  express  authority  is  there  for  public \nentities within the State to collaborate with other public entities within as well as \noutside the State. The reason for the amendment within section 3.3 is to allow \nthose public entities to collaborate with other private entities. \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nSection 1 says the same thing as section 3.3 but applies to Medicaid. There are \nspecific  statutes  governing  the  purchase  of  prescription  drugs  by  Medicaid.  If \nMedicaid wanted to participate, we would have to go into those statutes. This is a \nconforming  change  to  what  is  in  section  3.3.  The  change  from  the  existing \nlanguage in section 1 states we are allowing them to collaborate with one or more \npublic or private entities in Nevada, the District of Columbia and other states and \nterritories.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nPart of our intent is to save people money. Is this going to save patients and \nMedicaid money? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe testimony from Dr. Trevor Douglass during the hearing on the bill shows they \nare getting to a point where they have enough lives to have leverage in purchasing. \nThey are starting to see this turning into a reduction in the cost of pharmaceuticals \nto the members of the coalition. If Medicaid was a member of the coalition and \ncould pay less for each of those pharmaceuticals, the assumption is it will lower \nthe  cost  for  that  Medicaid  recipient  or  increase  the  amount  of  benefits  that \nMedicaid recipients can get because there is more money in the Medicaid pool. \n \nIf it is cheaper for these agencies to buy prescription drugs, then it should result in \na  lower  cost  for  the  end  user.  Because  we  are  talking  about  insurance  plans, \nwhether it ends up being a lower cost on that drug or a lower deductible, or the \ngeneral cost of their health insurance lowers, that is the idea. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI did not hear that the patient was going to save money. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSince there is no profit motive for public agencies, they will either save money or \nget more services because it does go back into the plan. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThe  more  the  coalitions  grow,  the  more  the  savings  could  be  for  those  who \nparticipate. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nI would suggest that Dr. Douglass’s primary testimony was that the coalitions save \nmost of their money by addressing rebates and other issues we are not addressing \nin this bill. \n \nMS. SLAMOWITZ: \nI would like to clarify that Dr. Douglass stated the coalitions negotiate additional \nrebates,  and  this  is  how  purchasers  save  money  on  drugs.  They  have  those \nnegotiations with the manufacturers. \n \nFor Medicaid, we have statutory rebates that are federal rebates, and then we have \nsupplemental rebates we negotiate with the manufacturers to further lower the \ncost of those drugs. The preferred drug list is created off placement based on those \nnegotiations. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nThe driving force—the more lives to leverage with those manufacturers—creates \nthat rebate pool to lower the cost of drugs for your entire membership. Those \nrebates are most important. \n \nWithin the State, there is expressed authority that if Medicaid wanted to join an \nentity  outside  the  State  with  the  Northwest  Prescription  Drug  Consortium,  it \nalready has a solution for managed care organizations (MCOs). It does not have a \nsolution for fee-for-service since we have both in the State. There is no opportunity \nfor Medicaid to join the Northwest Prescription Drug Consortium because of that. \nWe could look at collectively working with other entities within the State. \n \nOftentimes, when Medicaid gets pulled into it, it gets muddy because of the federal \nrequirements. The intent of this bill is to allow other public and private entities to \nwork cooperatively to reduce the cost of drugs to leverage those rebates through \nnegotiations based on the increased number of participants. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nDr. Douglass indicated coalitions captured 100 percent of that rebate minus a fixed \nadministrative cost for the RPBM administration. He had indicated that was where \na primary piece of their savings came from. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will entertain a motion on S.B. 396. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN MOVED TO AMEND AND DO PASS AS AMENDED \nS.B. 396. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the work session on S.B. 396 and open the work session on S.B. 376. \n \nSENATE BILL 376: Revises provisions relating to child welfare.

COMLOSSY: \nI will read the summary of the bill and the amendments from the work session \ndocument (Exhibit M). \n \nKENDRA BERTSCHY (Public Defender's Office, Washoe County): \nThe intention of the amendment is to provide clarification on what we should do \nwith  the  different  dispositions.  Only  the  dispositions  substantiated  are  those \nreported to the Central Repository for Nevada Records of Criminal History. When \nemployers request records to see what is substantiated, we want to ensure only \nsubstantiated dispositions released to those employers. \n \nIn addition, an amendment clarifies three other forms of disposition, other than the \nsubstantiated, have the same legal affect. We do not want to run into an issue in \nthe future where someone thinks having one of the other dispositions is makes it \nworse for his or her dependency case. \n \nSENATOR JAMES OHRENSCHALL (Senatorial District No. 21): \nI consider the amendments friendly and believe they improve the bill. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will entertain a motion on S.B. 376. \n \nSENATOR  HARDY  MOVED  TO  AMEND  AND  DO  PASS  AS  AMENDED \nS.B. 376. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the work session on S.B. 376. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nI will open the hearing on S.B. 390. \n \nSENATE BILL 390: Provides for the establishment of a statewide suicide prevention \nand mental health crisis hotline. (BDR 39-635) \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nSENATOR JULIA RATTI (Senatorial District No. 13): \nBoth  components  in  this  bill  have  the  opportunity  to  move  the  needle  in  our \nbehavioral health and substance use disorder space. Two things have happened \nrecently that we have been working a long time to ensure. The first is that in \nJanuary, the 988 number, a project that many behavioral health advocates have \nput hours into developing across the Nation, was approved and ready to go at the \nnational level. The 988 number becomes a behavioral health hotline based on our \nNational Suicide Prevention Lifeline similar to 911, after being under development \nfor many years. The federal regulatory process is done, and it us up to us as a \nState to implement it. \n \nThe next component has taken a significant amount of work and many hands to \nmake the labor light. Nevada was significantly impacted by the opioid crisis. People \non  this  Committee,  former  and  current  Governors,  and  former  and  current \nAttorneys General, have put time and energy into addressing the impact of the \nopioid epidemic on the State and ensuring those who contributed to that opioid \nepidemic be held accountable. \n \nAARON FORD (Attorney General): \nI am here today to speak about principles, underlying remediation and the status of \nthe opioid litigation as we discuss S.B. 390. \n \nThe Bureau of Consumer Protection, in conjunction with an outside contingency \ncounsel hired as a result of Governor Steve Sisolak’s declaration of findings on \nJanuary 29, 2019, has been working on numerous fronts in Nevada collectively \nknown as the opioids litigation. More than 60 defendants in our litigation help \nremediate  the  harms,  risks  and  effects  of  the  opioid  epidemic  in  Nevada  and \nthroughout our Country. Remediating the harm caused by the influx of opioids into \ncommunities throughout Nevada is paramount. The development of the proposed \namendment (Exhibit N) and the document from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of \nPublic  Health  on  Principles  for  the  Use  of  Funds  From  the  Opioid  Litigation \n(Exhibit O) were used as a guide. \n \nThe Principles for the Use of Funds From the Opioid Litigation, Exhibit O, is a \nconsensus document supported by a number of national organizations such as the \nAmerican Medical Association. The guiding principles are to first, use the funds to \nsupplement rather than supplant existing State spending; second, use funds to \nsupport programs supported by evidence-based interventions; third, use the funds \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nto support investments in youth prevention; fourth, use the funds with a focus on \nracial equity; and fifth, report to the public as to which programs are being funded. \n \nWhile my team and I have been focused on the litigation, the Department of Health \nand Human Services (DHHS) has designed this in a way best able to allocate the \nfunds according to the five principles. The DHHS conducts needs assessments and \nregularly coordinates with stakeholders, treatment providers, Nevada agencies and \nothers to administer funds for a variety of other health issues. \n \nMy team continues to fight on a multitude of litigation fronts. These fronts began \nwith  the  McKinsey & Company  $573  million  settlement  in  the  State’s  opioid \nlitigation currently pending in the Eighth Judicial District Court in Clark County. \nHowever,  the  fronts  also  include  the  national  litigation,  national  settlement \nnegotiations and recent developments in bankruptcy-related matters all related to \nopioids. \n \nMcKinsey & Company  is  a  global  consulting  firm  that  advised  Purdue  Pharma, \namong  others, on “turbocharging” opioid sales, even as the drug  manufacturer \nknew  patients  were  becoming  addicted  to  OxyContin  and  other  opioids. \nMcKinsey & Company agreed to a multistate settlement with attorneys general and \nfellow colleagues from 49 states, 5 territories and the District of Columbia. Nevada \ndid not participate in that settlement for a number of reasons, one of which is that \nNevada considers itself one of the hardest-hit states for the opioid epidemic. We \nhave favorable laws in Nevada that protect our citizens differently than residents of \nother states would have been protected. We would have gotten far less under this \nsettlement had we entered into the multistate settlement than we did going in on \nour own. \n \nNevada  negotiated  its  own  deal  with  McKinsey & Company  and  reached  a \n$45 million  settlement.  This  settlement  does  not  include  cities  and  counties \nbecause  Nevada  does  not  have  the  authority  to  settle  or  sue  on  behalf  of  its \npolitical  subdivisions  for  this  type  of  litigation.  The  lawsuit  the  Office  of  the \nAttorney General is pursuing is purely for damages the State has incurred. It is not \nrepresenting  any  county  or  municipality  in  this  litigation;  it  is  all  State-related \ndamages. The monies we brought in relate to those issues. Several municipalities \nwithin our State have their own litigation happening, and they will be receiving \nfunds when those lawsuits are won. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nAs with all litigation in Nevada and nationally, the Covid-19 pandemic slowed down \nthe progress of the Office of the Attorney General’s case. Despite this, our State \nagencies have continued to cooperate with the Office of the Attorney General to \ncollect discovery, even as most people were working from home. Discovery—a \nprocess in litigation where documents, depositions and things of that nature are \nexchanged between the parties—is an important component and ongoing through \nthis  pandemic.  Some  of  that  discovery  includes  ongoing  document  collection, \nreview  and  production  of  those  documents.  It  also  includes  a  review  of  the \ndefendant’s documents and the filing and arguing of discovery motions before the \nspecial  master  assigned  to  this  case.  We  are  starting  to  move  forward  with \nbeginning depositions which were also delayed due to the pandemic. \n \nWe have filed an amended complaint in this lawsuit naming additional defendants \nand causes of action that bring the total number of defendants in our lawsuit to 61. \nSome  of  these  newly  added  defendants  are  Johnson  and  Johnson;  Janssen; \nNoramco; Actavis; Allergan Finance LLC; Cephalon, Inc.; Watson Laboratories Inc.; \nCVS  TN  Distribution;  Longs  Drugs  Stores;  and  American  Drug  Stores  LLC. \nAdditionally, a second amended complaint contains detailed allegations to support \nthe  Nevada  False  Claims  Act  cause  of  action  as  well  as  additional  allegations \nregarding the conduct of some of the national retail pharmacies. \n \nThere is ongoing national litigation in federal court which is known as multidistrict \nlitigation. Opioid cases that end up being filed or drug into federal court, not in \nNevada’s case, are sent to Ohio for a federal judge to oversee the multidistrict \nlitigation  for  discovery.  That  judge,  Judge  Dan  Aaron  Polster,  has  postponed \nseveral upcoming trial dates. One trial set in West Virginia has a May trial date, and \nit appears that trial will go forward. That trial is against three distributors, not the \n61 defendants we have named. \n \nAlong  with  national  litigation  comes  discussions  around  national  settlement \nnegotiations.  You  may  have  heard  or  read  about  discussions  between  some \ndefendants who have been negotiating with a handful of attorneys general in an \nattempt  to  reach  a  settlement  with  all  states.  McKinsey & Company  was  an \nexample of that. These discussions have been happening for over a year, and from \nwhat has been publicly announced, the following proposals have been discussed. \n \nA $21 billion deal from distributors McKesson, Amerisource Health Services LLC \nand  Cardinal  Health  proposed  payout  over  an  18-year  period  and  an  additional \n$5 billion from Johnson and Johnson. That is one conversation around the national \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nsettlements taking place. While there is no agreement on how this money will be \ndistributed, in my estimation Nevada’s total share would not be enough to address \nor  remediate  the  harms  caused  by  its  opioid  epidemic.  Nevada’s  Office  of  the \nAttorney General is continuing to monitor these discussions, but we are moving \nforward with our own litigation. \n \nThe opioid-related bankruptcies add a new wrinkle to this conversation. Purdue \nPharma, a defendant in our litigation, filed a chapter 11 reorganization under the \nU.S. Bankruptcy Code, and a plan was filed earlier this month. Details described in \nthat plan are being negotiated. On April 21, there will be a hearing in New York \nwhere the bankruptcy court is expected to approve the disclosure statement, the \nvoting procedures and ballots for a deadline to vote on the plan set for July 14. \n \nKey terms of the proposed plan have $4.3 billion currently allocated to claims of \nnonfederal government claims—that is states, cities and counties. That amount of \nmoney will be distributed over a 10-year period and used for opioid abatement \npurposes  only.  The  allocation  amounts  for  the  states,  including  the  cities  and \ncounties, have not yet been determined. Cities, counties and states in which they \nare located will have conversations around ways to divide the money, and Nevada \nis no different in that regard. \n \nThe  Office  of  the  Attorney  General  will  continue  to  participate  in  a  creditors \ncommittee before the bankruptcy court for the purposes of staying abreast and \npursuing our ends in bankruptcy court. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nIf every case fell our way and things went well for Nevada on all of these cases, \ncan you give us a sense of scale of the estimated dollars? \n \nATTORNEY GENERAL FORD: \nWe have experts who are working on the report and discovery process and are not \nprepared to detail the exact numbers until the report has been released. I will say \nthat it is in the billions. We need to let the experts continue to work on the report. \n \nSENATOR RATTI:  \nYou  referred  to  some  cases  taking  place  this  month  and  a  trial  for  the \nthree distributors scheduled in May. Do you have an idea of how long it will take \nfor Nevada, and the Nation, to make its way through all of this litigation? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \nATTORNEY GENERAL FORD: \nWe had anticipated a trial date for Nevada’s litigation for early this year. We should \nhave been in January, but the Covid-19 pandemic pushed it back. We are looking \nat going to trial possibly mid-year 2022, depending on what the trial schedule looks \nlike in that regard. Our trial could take months. At this juncture, we anticipate we \nwill have some resolution within the next two years in our State case where we \nhave our 61 defendants who have been sued. \n \nThe bankruptcy cases are a little more difficult for us to estimate. Purdue Pharma \nand  the  posture  of  bankruptcy  cases  make  us  think  differently  about  how  we \nengage with our fellow attorneys general and municipalities within the State. The \nbankruptcy  courts  are  different  relative  to  the  litigation  components.  The \nreorganization plan put out recently will have movement on it on April 21 with \nballots  going  out  in  July.  This  means  they  are  moving  toward  some  level  of \nfinalization in the Purdue Pharma bankruptcy case. I would anticipate seeing things \nclose to finality there as it progresses. \n \nI do not know the trial schedule for West Virginia but would anticipate if it begins \nin May, four to five months may be the time frame for those cases. The Oklahoma \ncase took several months before it came to a verdict in favor of Oklahoma against \nJohnson and Johnson 18 months ago. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWhat is the difference between what is part of the State litigation and settlements \nand what local governments are doing on their own? Local governments have been \ndoing some actions independently. In S.B. 390, all of the money collected is being \nsubgranted to the local governments and nonprofits. If they are doing their own \nlitigation, I doubt they are going to subgrant it to us. \n \nATTORNEY GENERAL FORD: \nThe State litigation is purely brought forward on behalf of the State. These are \ncauses of action to Medicaid, for example, that directly relate to State damages. \nWe purposefully did not name any causes of action that would bring in the City of \nReno, Washoe County, Clark County, Las Vegas or Elko. As you have indicated, \nthey have their own pieces of litigation, and their damages are calculated according \nto how their experts have calculated them. I will leave the policy of how the funds \nare distributed to the policy makers. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \nTo the extent there is some overlap, it will take some determination on the policy \nmakers’ part as to how those issues will be addressed. We will be talking to the \nmunicipalities that have their own respective pieces of litigation, some of which are \ncaught up in bankruptcy issues or the multidistrict litigation, to determine how we \ncan work together. As a general matter, every dollar we bring in as the Office of \nthe Attorney General is a State dollar recovered under a lawsuit brought for the \nState, not for any county or municipality. \n \nJESSICA ADAIR (Chief of Staff, Office of the Attorney General): \nWithout getting too far into the bill, that is the wisdom of the amendment. These \nare State dollars. As the distributor of the funds, DHHS can ensure we are not \nsupplanting funds already distributed by the State and local governments. This will \nensure  we  use  that  funding  mechanism  with  the  appropriate  State  and  local \npartnerships, ensuring we are not double-dipping with this funding, and that local \ncounty governments with their own funding are not using State dollars in a way \nthat is inappropriate. \n \nThat is the benefit of DHHS being the distributor and working closely with local \ncounty health boards to ensure that does not happen. In addition to some of the \ncities and counties having their own lawsuits, some tribal entities in the State have \ntheir  own  lawsuits  related  to  opioid  litigation.  That  will  be  another  important \npartnership with State and local governments as we distribute this funding. \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nCan  you  explain  again  about  the  disbursement  of  funds  once  the  cases  are \nresolved, specifically about the communities hardest hit, making sure the dollars \ndistributed are commensurate with what they need to recover? \n \nATTORNEY GENERAL FORD: \nThe intent of this bill is to ensure the distribution of the opioid funds is to help \nabate things that have resulted due to the opioid epidemic. I am confident that \nequity issues will be taken into consideration. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThe proposed amendment, Exhibit N, was submitted on April 8. The first version of \nS.B. 390 came about quickly because the McKinsey & Company settlement with \n$45 million coming to us happened as we were coming into Session. As I started \nto learn more about where we were in the process of the opioid settlement and the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \nbillions of dollars that could be coming to the State, it felt important we develop \nthe legislative framework, knowing we would be in Session. \n \nSince  that  time,  we  have  done  a  significant  amount  of  work  with  DHHS,  the \ncounties and the Office of the Attorney General to develop a framework that makes \nsense. The amendment, Exhibit N, is a much better thought-out document. I am \nworking  collaboratively  on  the  settlement  framework  while  Assemblywoman \nJill Tolles, Assembly District No. 25, is working on reconstituting something similar \nto the opioid task force we used to have. We are broadening it as we understand \nwhile opioids have been a significant focus, all of the people who work within \nsubstance abuse disorder will tell you the shift is moving more toward heroin and \nmultiuse drugs. We need to have the broader conversation about substance use \ndisorder and prevention. \n \nThe proposed amendment, Exhibit N, is the product of the working group that \ncollaboratively worked to establish the best way to accomplish this. \n \nA significant amount of money is coming our way. Immediately, there will be a lot \nof people with many ideas on how we can spend this money. Because most of the \nsettlements will have some restricting language about how they can be used, we \nneed to make sure we are using the money in the way intended. A significant \nquantitative and qualitative needs assessment that is the first step. It is important \nthe analysis be based on meaningful data about impact. \n \nIn addition to data, analytics and things we will need to bring together, section 9, \nsubsection 1, paragraph (a) of the proposed amendment, Exhibit N, states that: \n \nThe  needs  assessment  shall  include  a  focus  on  health  equity  and \nidentifying  disparities  across  all  racial  and  ethnic  populations, \ngeographic  regions,  and  specific  populations  including  veterans, \npregnant women and parents with dependent children, LGBTQ, youth, \nand  individuals  or  families  involved  in  the  criminal  justice,  juvenile \njustice, and child welfare systems. \n \nAn awakening in this Country has led us to understand that Covid-19 has shone a \nlight on when we have bad things happen, such as an opioid epidemic. The impact \nto  subpopulations  is  not  the  same.  As  we  are  understanding  the  impact  to \neveryone, we want to understand the disparate impact to certain populations. That \nis built in up front in the needs assessment. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 27 \n \nSection  9,  subsection  1,  paragraphs  (b)  and  (c)  speak  to  taking  that  needs \nassessment and establishing Statewide priorities based on that needs assessment. \nThis will look at available data, the analysis of the disparate impact on communities \nof color, community stakeholder input and engagement consultation with subject \nmatter experts as they are the people who focus in this area. This is the process to \nmoving toward these priorities. We are making sure there is outreach to groups \nwho are impacted by the opioid crisis including those listed in paragraph (c). \n \nWe  could  not  name  the  substance  use  task  force  Assemblywoman  Tolles  is \nworking on because it is not yet in the law. If the timing works at the end of \nSession, we will amend this bill to add that task force as it is the intent that the \ntask force is working on some of this and can share the information it has from a \nbroader lens. \n \nSection 9, subsection 2 states what will be done at the conclusion of the needs \nassessment to work together to develop a plan for funding. The lawsuits are on the \nimpact to the State. In reality, every individual lives in a neighborhood, in a city, in \na county, in a state. When we work collaboratively with both the county and the \nState looking at their respective resources, we can effect a better impact. \n \nShould  the  county  have  the  resources  from  its  lawsuit  to  build  a  transitional \nhousing  property  and  the  State  puts  some  of  these  dollars  into  Medicaid  to \nleverage the services to be provided in that facility, you might see the two partners \ncollaborating in that way to alleviate one of the significant impacts of the opioid \nepidemic: a dramatic increase in homelessness. \n \nThe intent of section 9, subsection 2, paragraph (b) is that the State can keep the \nmoney and distribute it to State items and also subgrant it if that makes sense. We \nwill continue to work on this to ensure we have that language as tight as possible. \nThe State may also use up to 8 percent to manage administrative expenses or \nother indirect costs. \n \nThose wishing to apply for this money will need to have understood the needs \nassessment,  know  the  priorities  and  know  they  are  meeting  those  priorities. \nRequired reporting will be sent to the Governor, the Office of the Attorney General, \nregional  behavioral  health  boards,  directors,  Legislative  Counsel  Bureau,  Interim \nCommittees and the Legislature. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 28 \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nWould prevention programs qualify? We know that families, particularly students, \nwho live in a household where opioids are prevalent have been touched by this \ncrisis. Their learning has been truncated, and socially, there are a number of things \nthey cannot do. Is there any way for us to talk about prevention? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nEach settlement will come with its own restrictions baked into the language. That \nis the first piece; the second would be the data and needs assessment. \n \nMS. ADAIR: \nWe need to attack this epidemic at every point from prevention to remediation, \nwhere  people  are  currently  experiencing  problems,  to  wraparound  supports  for \nfamilies. Attorney General Ford  mentioned a document earlier published by the \nJohns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Exhibit O, and those guiding \nprinciples. Those principles are to spend money to save lives, use evidence to guide \nspending, invest in youth prevention, focus on racial equity and develop a fair and \ntransparent process for deciding where to spend the funding. \n \nWhen it comes to State-specific settlements, the Office of the Attorney General \ngets the opportunity to guide the development of those settlement terms. That is \nanother benefit to a State settlement versus a national multistate settlement where \nwe have to work with everyone to come up with that settlement agreement. \n \nPrevention  is  an  important  principle  and  should  be  something  this  Committee \nshould ensure is in the text of the bill to codify that. \n \nSTEPHANIE WOODARD, PSY.D. (Senior Advisor on Behavioral Health, Division of Public \nand Behavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services): \nPrevention is one of the five primary guides used to develop this section of the \nlegislation. In section 9, subsection 2, paragraph (a), Exhibit N, see “Plans must \ninclude strategies to address overdose prevention, disparities in access to care, and \nyouth prevention.” We do not want to be overly prescriptive in what needs to be in \nall of the plans driven by the needs assessment and community level outreach. We \ndid want to ensure all of the plans addressed at least those three primary issues. \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nThe  other  issue  is  cultural  competency.  The  money  will  come  with  its  own \nrequirements,  but  to  the  extent  possible,  the  State  would  make  sure  that \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 29 \n \norganizations of people who are participating in this have some level of cultural \ncompetency; otherwise, it will not work, especially in Black, Indigenous and People \nof Color (BIPOC) communities or in rural and frontier communities. You are talking \nabout different cultures where people understand things differently, talk differently \nand  have  someone  who  has  similar  lived  experience  or  understands  the  lived \nexperiences of other cultures. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nWe made sure the analysis talked about inequities and built in engagement for a \nbroad and diverse group of individuals, including those with lived experience. I do \nnot know if we have pulled in cultural competency as part of the plan, but we can \neasily do that. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nI am trying to understand the process for distributing the money. The way I read \nsection 9, subsection 2, the State and different local government agencies and \ntribes may develop plans following the needs assessments. Is it a competitive grant \nprocess to fund them? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThe  needs  assessment  would  be  performed  and  the  plan  created,  and  then \nsection 9, subsection 1, paragraph (g), subparagraphs (1), (2) and (3), Exhibit N, \nexplain this process. \n \nThe idea is the needs assessment develops the plan, the plan performs the granting \nas well as the ongoing living work that comes out of the substance use task force. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nI am confused by what the language in section 9, subsection 2, paragraph (a), \nExhibit N, says about the establishment of the process to allocate the funding for \nthe priorities and projects. \n \nDR. WOODARD: \nWe worked closely with the counties to find a way to develop equitable distribution \nof these funds while the State has the ability to retain some of these funds for \nstatewide  programming.  They  are  not  competitive  grants  based  on  population \nand/or impact to those direct communities in addition to what we would consider a \nbase. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 30 \n \nWe heard earlier these dollars may not come in all at once. They will likely come in \na staggered fashion, and some of the settlements may actually be protracted over \nthe course of several years. Not knowing how much money we may have to use, \nthis seemed like the best way to move forward depending on how much money is \nin the account, what is determined for investments and what is determined to be \ndistributed to the communities. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWe have the Fund for a Healthy Nevada. I worry creating the Nevada Fund for \nHealthy Communities would have us duplicating our efforts. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThe original intent was all capital, so it was just going to be the healthy Nevada \nfund capital account. Part of the premise of the bill is that we have the internal \ncapacity  in  terms  of  grant  allocation  and  distribution.  For  things  we  do  on  a \nStatewide impact, we either collaborate with the counties or subgrant to counties \nand  nonprofits  with  our  Behavioral  Health  Block  Grants.  The  State  Health  and \nHuman Services workforce is a combination of people who facilitate the work of \nother people and some who do direct services. \n \nPhilosophically, the concept is more the flow through and facilitating the work of \npeople because every individual lives in a neighborhood, in a city, in a county, in a \nstate. If there are concerns around that, we can strengthen the language to say the \nState can consider its own needs in addition to the needs of the counties and come \nup with the correct name for the fund. \n \nDR. WOODARD: \nTo Senator Kieckhefer’s earlier question, we will be requiring counties and tribes \nthat  receive  opioid  recoveries  to  inform  us  and  ensure  it  is  incorporated  in \ndeveloping and improving their plans. We want those plans to be updated no less \nthan  every  three  years  knowing  we  may  be  having  dollars  distributed  for  a \nconsiderable period of time. \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nThere is not enough diversity to comment on the things that need to happen in \nvarious communities by those determining who will receive the grant and how \nmuch they will receive. Representation matters to the extent possible to make sure \nit is representative of county to county, state to state; what does that look like? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 31 \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThat is woven well within the document. We can take another look at it from the \ndecision-making lines and ensure we are checking all of the boxes. \n \nI will move on to the second part of this bill. We now have the final approval on the \nestablishment  of  the  988  national  suicide  prevention  and  mental  health  crisis \nhotline. Part of the continuum of care for behavioral health and substance use \ndisorder is a focus on crisis and what kind of a response individuals in crisis need. \n \nToday when people are in crisis, they are most likely to call 911 and get the \noperator who will ask them if the call is for police, fire or medical. If you are in a \nbehavioral health or substance use crisis, often those are not the correct questions. \nThis  is  a  national  movement  to  divert  behavioral  health  crisis  calls  out  of  the \n911system and more appropriately received by a behavioral health crisis system \nbuilt off the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline model. \n \nDR. WOODARD: \nI will be sharing a slide presentation on the 988 line (Exhibit P). There is a specific \nsection in the bill that addresses the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline which will \nsoon  be  known  as  the  three-digit  number  988.  National  guidelines  have  been \ndeveloped for a coordinated crisis continuum of care. Essentially, this coordinated \ncrisis system of care ensures when individuals are in crisis, he or she has someone \nto talk to, someone to respond to them, somewhere to go, and the services and \nsupports provided are based on best practices. These guidelines have been the \nfoundation of the work Nevada has undergone Statewide and regionally over the \npast three years. \n \nSlide 2 of the presentation, Exhibit O, explains 988. In 2020, the Lifeline nationally \nfielded nearly 2.4 million calls. Nevada’s lifeline had 83,000 contacts in 2019. Over \n19,000 of those contacts were from Nevada, and 9,000 of those contacts were \ntext messages from youth under the age of 18. These crisis calls and texts were \nfrom  all  over  the  State:  25  percent  from  Washoe  County,  31 percent  from \nClark County, 18 percent from the rural counties and 26 percent of the calls from \nunknown locations; but from Nevada. \n \nWith an easy-to-remember and dialed number like 988, the lifeline hopes to reach \nmany more individuals in emotional crisis. By July 2022 when people have an \nurgent mental health need, they will call 988. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 32 \n \nSlide 3 covers the 988 call projections. In order for the 988 line to be operational \nwithin states, we are essentially changing the ten-digit telephone number for the \nNational Suicide Prevention Lifeline to the three-digit number. There is a projected \nnumber  of  increased  calls.  Nationally,  these  calls  are  projected  from  anywhere \nbetween 6 million and 13 million to high projections from 12 million to 41 million \nover the course of 5 years. \n \nThe  reason  for  the  increased  call  projections  is  the  calls  will  include  not  only \nexisting lifeline calls served by 988 but calls diverted from other existing crisis \nlines, 911 and potential new callers in the community who choose to call 988 \nshould they be in a behavioral health crisis. These call projections are essential \nwhen Nevada is determining how to grow our 988 call center. We are awaiting our \nState-specific projected call estimate. This will be essential in our planning and \npreparation for going live in July 2022. \n \nSlide 4 explains how 988 is the foundation for crisis care. There are gaps within \nthe crisis system in our communities. We have spoken with this Committee and the \nInterim Committees around the need for crisis services. Primarily, we rely on 911 \nwhich triggers the emergency response through emergency medical services (EMS) \nand law enforcement, sometimes with tragic outcomes. The ideal crisis system \nwould match the right intervention to the right person, at the right place and at the \nright time. It is estimated that approximately 80 percent of individuals who call a \ncrisis  line  have  their  issues  resolved  over  the  phone.  Without  such  services, \nindividuals may forego the care they need or unnecessarily use high-cost services \nsuch as emergency rooms. \n \nIn 2020 when we did the mapping, we found there were still significant gaps in the \ncapabilities  of  Nevada’s  crisis  call  line  that  will  need  to  be  addressed  in  the \nimplementation planning for the 988 system. In Nevada on any given day, we have \nmore than 90 individuals waiting in emergency rooms for inpatient care, many of \nwhom  could  be  and  should  be  better  served  within  other  care  settings.  In \n2020 alone, we had just under 18,000 visits to emergency rooms by individuals \nwho had a diagnosis of either suicide attempt or ideation. \n \nWe know from some of the mapping done that our rural areas have significant \naccess-to-care issues. Because of this limitation, law enforcement is often used to \ntransport—sometimes five individuals in seven  hours—to  urban areas to ensure \nindividuals being seen by a behavioral health professional. By expanding access to \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 33 \n \n988  and  the  additional  crisis  services,  we  can  ensure  individuals  are  served \nadequately in their community whenever possible. \n \nThe  overutilization  of  emergency  services  within  EMS  and  law  enforcement \ncontinues to resolve costly use of critical public safety resources, lengthy wait \ntimes and sometimes a mismatch of intervention to needs. \n \nSlide 5 reviews the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act of 2020 and what it \nrequires. The National Suicide Designation Act passed in 2020 and became a law in \nOctober 2020. We need to go live and have that rolled out by July 16, 2022. We \nanticipate significant growth in the number of calls projected to the 988 line, so we \nneed to prepare our system to answer those calls and do the critical work of \nconnecting those individuals to additional care should it be needed. That additional \ncare may be community-based providers, mobile crisis teams or crisis stabilization \ncenters. \n \nAt the federal level, legislation authorizes states to establish a fee, and that fee will \nbe established in a fund. That fund should be sequestered to be obligated and \nexpended only in support of 988 and crisis services. We are looking at a go-live \ndate of July 16, 2022, regardless of whether we generate additional funding or \nnot. \n \nSlide 6 reviews the guiding principles of the 988 line. These include making sure \n988 is universally available by call, text or chat. Chat is an extension of what is \nalready available through our crisis support services. We want to ensure these calls \nare  consistently  responded  to  with  services  in  line  with  best  practices  and  a \nlocalized response. \n \nSlide 7 shows the national landscape of crisis legislation. Nevada is not the only \nstate proposing legislation. We have two states that have signed similar bills into \nlaw,  Washington  and  Virginia.  Three  states  have  bills  passed  through  at  least \n1 house, and 14 additional states have introduced legislation based on some of the \nmodel legislation developed at the national level. \n \nSlides 8 and 9 cover the 8 core elements for the implementation plan. In tangent to \nthis legislation, 49 other states have been granted a planning grant. At the national \nand  federal  levels,  they  see  the  importance  of  states  preparing  to  go  live  in \nJuly 2022. We are implementing the planning grant which requires us to establish \nan implementation plan to be submitted by August. Each of the eight core elements \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 34 \n \nmust be addressed in the plan. The plan will be addressing the elements listed on \nSlides 8 and 9. \n \nAdditional resources are shown on Slide 10 should any Committee members want \nto  refer  to  the  community  mapping  I  identified  earlier.  We  did  some  lengthy \ncommunity mapping by state and by region, including looking at all assets and gaps \nacross the entire crisis continuum of care. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThe proposed amendment, Exhibit N, changes the mental health crisis to behavioral \nhealth crisis to be more inclusive in the language. Bottom line, this bill seeks the \nauthority to raise the fee authorized in federal legislation. Once the 988 line goes \nlive, call volume will increase. Our lifeline is operational now, but if the resources \ndo  not  keep  up  with  the  volume  of  calls,  people  will  wait  to  have  their  calls \nanswered when they are experiencing suicidal ideation. That is the worst possible \noutcome. \n \nWe do not get to choose when it goes live. We have the planning grant to which \nthe State is processing data and analysis of how many calls may merit a fee that \nmakes sense. Rather than putting a dollar amount on that fee in statute, it is \nallowed in regulatory process because we do not want to under-shoot or overshoot \nthe law. \n \nToday’s 911 fees in our State range from $.45 to $1.25 per month. This range is \nbecause 911 is driven at the county level. Counties have different rates they have \nassessed. Other states’ fees have been in the 30-cent range. Rather than guessing, \nthe regulatory process would allow for a look at the data to decide what we need \nand set the fee. National campaigns to promote the 988 number will create an \ninflux of calls, so it is important we turn the 988 line on and ensure sure we have \nthe resources to respond to these calls. \n \nUtah  just  passed  its  bill.  In  addition  to  establishing  a  rate,  the  state  did  a \n$16 million allocation to do the interoperability work that could get everyone ready \nfor 911 and 988. We are not asking for that at this point, but we are asking to not \nleave the lifeline hanging without the resources it needs once it is live. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 35 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIs it possible for this first allocation of settlement funds from the Office of the \nAttorney General to fund the stand-up of the 988 line so we can see the volume \nand get a better idea the ongoing resource needs? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThe  988  fee  money  is  less  about  the  stand-up  and  more  about  the  ongoing \noperating costs. This is more about the first-tier money the Crisis Support Services \nof Nevada would need to add extra staff to answer additional calls, texts and \nchats. While there could be a large amount of money coming our way, it is not \nnecessarily sustainable ongoing money. \n \nAnalysis based on the $45 million settlement would have come to us. Language in \nthat $45 million settlement directs where money should go for the opioid impact, \nand we would have to make the argument that everything in the crisis response \nsystem has that nexus to the opioid impact. \n \nIt is unknown where that allocation will go. Dr. Woodard and I have discussed \nstand-up  dollars  and  the  American  Rescue  Plan.  In  terms  of  one-shot  monies, \nparticularly on interoperability between 911 and 988, I will vote for everything we \nneed to spend that money on. \n \nThis is about the ongoing dollars, year in and year out, the actual services to be \nprovided through the phone lines, and any excess can trickle down to the mobile \noutreach teams and stabilization centers. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nHow much funding do we allocate toward this now? \n \nDR. WOODARD: \nThrough the Bureau of Behavioral Health Wellness and Prevention, Crisis Support \nServices of Nevada receives just under $1.1 million. The intent going forward is the \nfunds generated through fees, and the fund would not supplant, but supplement \nthose funds. We continue to commit funding as long as it is available, including \neligible federal grants we applied for and used to help the Crisis Support Services \nof Nevada to do that work. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIs there an anticipated reduction in 911 workload? \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 36 \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nInitially, no. There is hope that over time that would happen. The front end of this \nwill be more about collaboration and interoperability, so there may potentially be \nmore  work  for  911.  We  need  them  to  update  their  protocols  to  triage  calls \nappropriately to do a handoff to the 988 team when the calls come in to them. On \nthe front end, and until enough of the public gets trained to call 988, they will have \nthe same workload; they will just be routing the calls to a different place. \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nIs 8 percent of the funding going to be used for administrative purposes? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nUp to 8 percent will be used for administrative purposes. \n \nDR. WOODARD: \nWe added the standard 5 percent administrative cap; the 8 percent are the indirect \nfees. If we are providing grant funds to any entities, they can charge no more than \n8 percent in indirect fees to those costs. \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nIt will be important for staff to look like the people we serve. If we do not state this \nin the bill, it is easy to overlook. Diversity in the staff is crucial. \n \nThe language barrier and 911 have been an issue happening in several areas where \nI live. If there is a way to identify the most prominent languages for an area, that \nwould be helpful, unless the calls go into a central location and are then passed on \nto specific places. What can we anticipate in terms of language challenges? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThis is building off the suicide crisis lifeline already in place. Language access is a \nsignificant part of the work they have done. It is baked into the bill, and as you \nstated, not every language is available all of the time. Because we are talking about \nsuicide crisis response, in many cases that has been anticipated. \n \nA directive about staff would put human resources policy into a bill that I am \nneither sure would fit in nor sure what we could do in terms of mandating diversity \nfor staff. In many of the efforts you are working on, we will make that a priority. I \nam unsure we can tie it to a specific program. Adding input and decision makers on \nall stakeholder engagement can be tackled in this. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 37 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIf we recognize the power faith-based organizations have, even if they “aren’t” the \nemployee but the power in knowing about 988, we will get at what we are doing. \nIf we do not have the trust of faith-based organizations, the look-alikes, we lose \ninstead of gain. To look-alike, sound-alike, worship alike and be alike are critical for \nthe process. Whether they are hired or not, they need to be involved. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThey are explicitly referenced on the opioid settlement planning and stakeholder \nengagement process. There are no details in the bill about the 988 rollout, but \nfaith-based organizations would be part of the strategy. \n \nROBIN REEDY (National Alliance on Mental Illness): \nI will read from my written testimony (Exhibit Q) in support of S.B. 390. \n \nMARY WALKER (Carson City; Douglas County; Carson Tahoe Health System): \nI am representing Carson City, Douglas County and Carson Tahoe Health System in \nsupport of S.B. 390. There is also a written statement (Exhibit R) in support of \nS.B. 390 from Alan Garrett, President and CEO of Carson Tahoe Health. \n \nSenate Bill 390 is the best opportunity I have seen in many years for the State \nworking  in  partnership  with  local  government,  healthcare  providers  and  many \nnonprofit  stakeholders  to  fund  and  improve  mental  health  services  in  Nevada. \nOften, mental health programs are the last to be funded and the last to expand \nservices. With S.B. 390, significant advances can be made to help people with \nthese  needs  on  the  ground,  not  only  with  opioid  funding  but  with  the \nimplementation of a suicide prevention lifeline. \n \nI appreciate the thoughtful approach to developing a comprehensive grant system \nas provided in S.B.  390 and its proposed amendment, Exhibit N. This bill  has \nseveral checks and balances including reporting requirements and limitations to the \nuse of the funding, which will mean there is an effort to ensure every dollar will \ncount. \n \nOMAR SAUCEDO (AT&T): \nBy way of standing in support of S.B. 390, AT&T provides traditional landline \nservice, voice and wireless service—essentially, all the areas of voice service in \nNevada. We have seen numerous 988 bills to fund suicide prevention and mental \nhealth crisis operations introduced in other states. As a result of the new federal \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 38 \n \nlaw,  some  states  have  elected  to  implement  a  surcharge  similar  to  what  is \nproposed  in  S.B. 390,  while  other  states  have  paid  for  the  program  with \ngeneral fund dollars. We hope to continue to work with the bill sponsor to ensure \nthe surcharge funding base is equitable and includes technologies as similar bills in \nColorado, Idaho and Kansas have considered and passed. \n \nIn an effort to ensure transparency, we respectfully encourage an ongoing process \nfor consumer dollars collected under this surcharge being periodically reviewed and \nadjusted based on the actual direct cost of the crisis centers that respond to these \n988 calls. Likewise, once we have worked through the implementation and start-up \ncosts, it would be reasonable to expect the surcharge could be adjusted downward \nbased on the ongoing budget needs. \n \nIt is important to note the federal 988 law provides specific language as to what \nsurcharge funds can be used for under this act. This is relevant because voice and \nwireless services are regulated at the federal level, not the state level. The states’ \nauthority here is narrowly defined. \n \nAs the bill makes its way through the legislative process, we would appreciate the \nopportunity to take part in any working group or stakeholder meeting and in any \ntask force charged with the implementation of this important program. \n \nJENNIFER CLAYPOOL: \nI support S.B. 390. I have been a volunteer on the National Suicide Prevention \nLifeline and a caller to the lifeline. I know what a valuable resource it can be. When \nyou are in the deepest, darkest time of your life, trying to remember a ten-digit \nphone number can be almost impossible. \n \nOnce the 988 line is operational, many people in the frontier and rural parts of \nNevada may want to help but cannot get to the crisis centers where the calls will \ncome in. Moving forward, it is my hope there will be plans to implement rural crisis \ncenters for those individuals to receive and provide help. \n \nJAMIE RODRIGUEZ (Washoe County): \nWashoe County supports S.B. 390. \n \nCHRISTINA CAPPELLO (American Foundation for Suicide Prevention): \nThe American Foundation for Suicide Prevention supports S.B. 390. We are the \nleading national not-for-profit organization exclusively dedicated to saving lives and \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 39 \n \nbringing hope to those affected by suicide. Our local Nevada chapter carries out \nthis mission across the State through research, education, advocacy and support \nefforts. \n \nI stand in support of S.B. 390 as a survivor of suicide loss and in support of my \nloved ones, including my mother, who have struggled with their mental health and \nhave  called  the  National  Suicide  Prevention  Lifeline.  While  factors  leading  an \nindividual to attempt suicide are complex, many of the impacts of Covid-19 are \nassociated with increased risk of suicide including social disconnection, anxiety, \ndepression, substance use, loss, grief and lack of access to physical and mental \nhealth care. \n \nWe do not yet know the impact on suicide rates. There could be increases in \nsuicide  risk  if  community  cohesion  diminishes  and  less  attention  is  paid  to \nintentional social connections, proactive resilience and mental health self-care, and \nthe importance of engaging mental health treatment. Statewide crisis call centers \nand crisis response services need more resources and funding to build capacity and \nresponse to growing community crisis needs. \n \nSoon, callers experiencing a suicide or mental health crisis will call 988 instead of \n911  to  receive  appropriate  care  and  mitigate  unnecessary  law  enforcement \ninvolvement.  Reliance  on  law  enforcement  often  means  people  suffering  from \nmental illnesses are put through an expensive and traumatizing revolving door as \nthey shuttle between jails, emergency rooms and the streets. \n \nMS. JACOB: \nClark County supports S.B. 390. \n \nGERARD KEEGAN (Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association): \nI will read from written testimony (Exhibit S) in neutral to S.B. 390. \n \nRACHELLE L. PELLISSIER (Crisis Support Services of Nevada): \nCrisis Support Services of Nevada was established in 1966 as an all-volunteer, \n24-hour suicide prevention hotline to address the high rate of suicide in Nevada. \nCrisis Support Services is one of the longest running crisis call centers in the Nation \nand the lifeline call center for the entire State. Any calls from Nevada area codes \nfrom the lifeline number 800-273-8255 come into our facility. We are also one of \nonly nine national call centers that receives calls from other regions when their call \ncenters are overwhelmed. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 40 \n \nWhen 988 is implemented, all calls from Nevada will come into our facility. It will \nallow Nevadans in a behavioral health crisis to easily access crisis intervention \nservices because they will not have to find and call a ten-digit number. For too \nlong,  our  system  of  mental  health  crisis  services  has  been  underfunded  and \nundervalued.  It  is  time  to  meet  this  challenge  with  the  evidence-based  crisis \nintervention and care systems the 988 crisis line will provide. \n \nSenate Bill 390 will allow us the vital funding sources we need to provide the crisis \nintervention  Nevadans  need  and  deserve.  Our  answer  rate  of  lifeline  calls  is \napproximately 80 percent, and the queue time averages 65 seconds. In a crisis, \n65 seconds is a lifetime. When 988 is implemented, it is estimated the call volume \nwill increase up to 30 percent. If we do not fund the system through this bill, we \nwill not have the appropriate resources to address this increase in volume which \nmeans answer rates will plummet and wait times will increase. We will not have \nthe  resources  to  help  implement  the  vital  mobile  teams  and  crisis  stabilization \ncenters across the State. \n \nCrisis Support Services of Nevada supports S.B. 390. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nWe have been in contact with AT&T that asked us about including additional lines. \nOur legal counsel looked into it, and the authorizing language at the federal level \nonly calls out cell lines; therefore, that is what we can include. AT&T has worked \non this in other states and will provide me with additional information to see if it \ngets a different assessment. We would ultimately like to include all lines as this \nwould generate additional revenue and keep the fee lower for everyone else. \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 390. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will open the hearing on S.B. 325. \n \nSENATE BILL 325: Establishes provisions relating to preventing the acquisition of \nhuman immunodeficiency virus. (BDR 54-632). \n \nSENATOR JAMES A. SETTELMEYER (Senatorial District No. 17): \nSenate Bill 325 and the proposed amendment (Exhibit T) seek to allow pharmacists \nto prescribe a protocol authorizing pharmacists to dispense drugs that prevent the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 41 \n \nacquisition of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and set forth the ability for \nthem to do such things as testing and other matters. \n \nWe are experiencing a healthcare shortage in Nevada, and we need more doctors. \nThis bill seeks to try to bring in another avenue for individuals to receive drugs for \npreventing the acquisition of HIV. \n \nELIZABETH MACMENAMIN (Retail Association of Nevada): \nIn Nevada, we experience the lack of health care or the ability for some to receive \nhealth care. Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, community pharmacies have been \ngranted an increased authority to provide enhanced access to essential medicines \nand  clinical  care,  for  example,  the  testing  and  immunizations  they  have  been \nproviding throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. \n \nEffective deliveries of these care services have further underscored the value that a \npharmacist and pharmacy team offer to best meet the healthcare needs of their \ncommunities. An estimated 1.1 million people are living with HIV in the United \nStates, and 14 percent, 1 in 7 people, are unaware they are infected. Community \npharmacies provide affordable quality healthcare services and can improve access \nto HIV testing and preventative medications for those who need it while at the \nsame time addressing the health disparities we have in Nevada. \n \nThe  number  of  HIV  infections  disproportionately  affect  minority  populations, \nincluding Black and Latino individuals which represent 69 percent of all new HIV \ndiagnoses. Pharmacists and their staffs are standing ready to provide expanded, \ntimely and convenient access to HIV testing and prevention through increasing \naccess  to  and  use  of  the  pre-exposure  prophylactic  (PrEP)  or  post-exposure \nprophylactic (PEP). \n \nNevada law should be modernized to enable pharmacists to provide public health \nservices to its citizens. Twelve states have taken steps to expand access. This \ninformation  is  included  in  the  pre-exposure  prophylaxis  articles  (Exhibit  U), \nSecondary HIV Prevention by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (Exhibit V) \nand state information (Exhibit W). \n \nANDRE WADE (Silver State Equality): \nThe HIV virus weakens a person’s immune system by destroying cells that fight \ndisease  and  infection.  Although  there  is  no  effective  cure  for  HIV,  it  can  be \nmanaged  and  controlled  through  medication.  There  are  various  modes  of \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 42 \n \ntransmission for HIV such as sex and drug injection equipment. However, there are \nways in which HIV transmission can be prevented by the use of medication such as \nPrEP, which has about a 99 percent effective rate, or PEP, which has about a \n90 percent effective rate depending on the mode of transmission. \n \nA  five-year  Ending  the  HIV  Epidemic:  A  Plan  for  America  was  developed  in \nresponse  to  the  guidance  provided  by  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and \nPrevention (CDC). Nevada has been unquestionably impacted by the HIV epidemic \nwith the highest rate of new infections in the western United States. Furthermore, \nlarge racial ethnic disparities exist in HIV transmission, particularly among the Black \npopulation as mentioned previously. \n \nFour pillars defined by the CDC include diagnose, treat, prevent and respond. Focus \ngroups across the State were conducted by the End the HIV Epidemic group to \nallow people to weigh in on shaping the plan to end HIV in Nevada. In these focus \ngroups, access to acknowledge PrEP and PEP has been identified as an important \nstrategy. A strength related to prevention includes the trust people have in local \ncommunity clinics and organizations. \n \nA goal for the Ending the HIV Epidemic Plan is to prevent new HIV transmission by \nusing  proven  interventions  including  PrEP  and  PEP.  Senate  Bill  325  will  help \nincrease access to medication and services that can prevent the transmission of \nHIV by enabling pharmacists to provide medication to consumers. Today’s law \nshould fully recognize the ability of a pharmacist to order, administer, bill and be \nreimbursed for FDA-authorized tests. It would be a game changer for Nevada if \nconsumers could access medications like PrEP and PEP with a single visit to the \npharmacy without the need for authorization. \n \nJOHN “ROB” PHOENIX (Huntridge Family Clinic): \nI will read from my written testimony (Exhibit X) in support of S.B. 325. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI look at the pre- and post-exposure medications much like the Plan B One-Step \nmorning after pill. The pharmacist does not need to make a diagnosis. One issue \nmissing in the bill is follow-up care. If we get a positive test, the person ought to \nbe under the care of someone. Pre- and post-exposure is vital.  \n \nIt is critical that the pharmacist is in a position to make this happen. I do not want \na person waiting for the next day, or days to follow, when you are supposed to see \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 43 \n \nyour doctor in order to get a prescription. I want to make sure this is available for \neither or all partners who have been exposed. This is a critical option for people to \nhave access to. \n \nKAYLYNN BOWMAN: \nAs a licensed pharmacist, I support S.B. 325. I have practiced for 14 years in \nNevada. The legislation proposed in this bill will prove timely and equitable access \nto HIV preventative care in Nevada. We are experiencing a time where pharmacists \ncan provide improved access to care that is convenient, private and affordable. \nThrough a grant with Ryan White Part A Program, I work with patients living with \nHIV  by  providing  medication  adherence  counseling,  health  education  and  risk \nreduction classes, along with wellness checks. \n \nMaking HIV preventative care through neighborhood pharmacies easily accessible \nto all persons in Nevada will help stop the spread of HIV. Pharmacists follow State \nprotocols for immunizations and analoxum therapies and are skilled and capable of \nproviding other clinical services, such as access to birth control and HIV preventive \ntherapies.  Pharmacists  can  order  and  perform  laboratory  testing  and  provide \nnecessary drug therapy for preventing the acquisition of HIV. \n \nThis legislation also supports the requirement for public and private health plans \nincluding Medicaid to cover HIV prevention drug therapies, any related laboratory \ntesting, prescribing and dispensing by a pharmacist at an equal rate of that by a \nphysician, physician assistant or advanced nurse practitioner for similar services. It \nwill also advance the profession of pharmacy in Nevada which will in turn improve \nthe health of our patients. \n \nLEANA RAMIREZ: \nI will read from my written testimony (Exhibit Y) in support of S.B. 325. \n \nKENNETH KUNKE (Nevada Pharmacy Alliance): \nI will read from my written testimony (Exhibit Z) in support of S.B. 325. \n \nCHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS (Southern Nevada Health Consortium): \nThe  Southern  Nevada  Health  Consortium  supports  S.B. 325.  This  organization \nworks  to  combat  stigma  around  HIV  by  ending  the  HIV  epidemic  through \ncommunity education and linkage to services. The HIV virus remains a significant \npublic issue in Nevada as we rank fifth in the Nation for the number of individuals \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 44 \n \nnewly diagnosed with HIV. There are people living with HIV in all 17 counties in \nNevada. \n \nOne of the goals of the federal Ending the HIV Epidemic Plan is the reduction of \nnew infections by 75 percent by 2025 and 90 percent by 2030. The Plan focuses \non the 50 local areas that account for more than half of new diagnoses in the \nCountry, and Clark County is one of the 48 counties listed. One of the ways to \nreduce those infections is to create access to PrEP which has shown to be over \n99 percent effective in preventing the sexual transmission of HIV when taken as \nprescribed. Access to PrEP is an issue this bill helps to address. Nevada has a \nsignificant shortage of primary care providers, yet the majority of Americans live \nwithin five miles of a pharmacy and are able to access those services. \n \nIn  addition  to  dispensing  medications  and  ensuring  patient  safety,  today’s \npharmacists  are  taking  a  larger  role  as  medical  counselors,  educators  and \nadvocates, and have a greater accessibility in the community. It sometimes takes \nweeks to months to get an appointment with a medical provider; it is much easier \nto access and speak with a pharmacist. Unlike an appointment with a doctor, you \nhave more than 15 minutes to address your issues. \n \nAs one of the more than 10,500 people living with HIV in Nevada, I would love to \nhave had access to medications to prevent my HIV diagnosis. I would urge you to \nconsider the changing role of pharmacists as a member of the medical care team, \nNevada’s role in ending the HIV epidemic and how eliminating the barrier of access \nto PrEP can impact the thousands of Nevadans at risk of acquiring HIV. \n \nMATT ROBINSON (Southern Nevada Health District): \nThe Southern Nevada Health District is neutral on S.B. 325 and generally believes \nthat any effort to expand access to preventative medicines should be embraced. It \nis critical that during the regulation creation process the proper standards of care \nprotocols be adopted by the State Board of Pharmacy as is called for in the bill. \n \nDUANE YOUNG (Deputy Administrator, Division of Health Care Financing and Policy, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nThe Division of Health Care Financing and Policy recognizes there is a fiscal note. \nThis is a budget-neutral initiative since it would transfer the cost of visits that \nwould regularly occur under a primary care physician, advance practice registered \nnurse or physician assistant to a pharmacist. Transferring that to the pharmacist \nhas no initial cost. However, there is a fiscal note for system upgrades. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 45 \n \nThe Division has taken steps to remove that fiscal note because the cost can be \nabsorbed in other areas as similar bills would establish this provider type. We have \nnotified the sponsor of this and taken the steps to remove that. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will entertain a motion on S.B. 325. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN MOVED TO AMEND AND DO PASS AS AMENDED \nS.B. 325. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 325 and open the hearing on S.B. 341. \n \nSENATE BILL 341: Revises provisions relating to health care. (BDR 40-62) \n \nSENATOR PAT SPEARMAN (SENATORIAL DISTRICT NO. 1): \nAs Mr. James Baldwin said, “Not everything that is faced can be changed, but \nnothing can be changed until it is faced.” \n \nThis bill is an effort to face systemic racism and structures of racial discrimination \nin  Nevada  and  elsewhere  that  create  generational  poverty  and  perpetual, \ndebilitating, economic, educational health hardships for people of color. Today, I \nreceived notice that the CDC agrees with Nevada. On Thursday, the CDC called \nracism a serious threat to public health thus becoming the latest and largest United \nStates-based health agency to single out racism as having a profound and negative \nimpact on communities of color and contributing to disproportionate mortality rates \namong people of color. \n \nThis bill is designed to not just recognize this exists but to ensure we are doing \neverything possible we can to correct it. The CDC also noted that communities of \ncolor suffered disproportionately in terms of contracting and becoming fatalities in \nCovid-19. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 46 \n \nA  friend  of  mine  told  me  that  people  of  European  decent  caught  a  cold  with \nCovid-19, but people in BIPOC communities contracted pneumonia. With this bill, \nwe can put things in place to address this. \n \nThe conceptual amendment (Exhibit AA) addresses the biggest sections of the bill. \nOriginally, we said it would delete sections 6, 7, 12, 13, 14 and 15 of the bill. We \nare deleting the requirement for a task force and making changes in how these \nprograms are funded. \n \nIt is critical we do this while focusing on making good changes; now is the time to \nact. \n \nSections 2 and 17 require the Division of Public and Behavioral Health (DPBH) of \nDHHS  to  apply  for  grants  from  the  federal  government  and  other  sources  to \nsupport the provisions of health care, promote the well-being, behavioral health and \nemotional well-being in communities with a higher risk of problems. \n \nBefore Governor Steve Sisolak issued the executive order, a number of things were \nhappening in BIPOC communities. Those things were exacerbated by Covid-19. We \nhad more illness and, as mentioned previously, mental and behavioral emotional \nhealth issues. Organizations in the community were picking up the slack. We had \none funeral home owner and director, who is a counselor, and some pastors, who \nwere  fielding  questions  of  sadness  that  came  about  from  Covid-19,  trying  to \nreassure people that everything would be alright. \n \nWe  pieced  together  things  that  would  help  get  the  community  through  this \nepidemic. A pastor, Pastor Robert Fowler of the Victory Missionary Baptist Church, \nwhose presence in the community was so large many people considered him their \npastor, passed away suddenly. The day we got the news, I was attempting to \nmake contact with the pastoral staff to see if there was anything I could do but \nwas  unable  to  help  out.  While  on  the  phone  with  one  of  our  United  States \nSenators, the pastoral senior staff said they were struggling because all of the \nmembers were asking what they should do, but they were having problems too and \ndid not know where to turn. \n \nSenate Bill 341 is designed to ensure we are focusing on the needs of the BIPOC \ncommunities  as  they  have  been  hit  harder  than  anywhere  else  and  to  ensure \nmonies that come into the State are distributed proportionately to those who have \nbeen affected. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 47 \n \nJEANETTE BELZ (Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Inc.): \nChronic kidney disease is the ninth-leading cause of death in the United States. An \nestimated 37 million people in the United States have chronic kidney disease, and \nover 40,000 people in Nevada are living with the disease. Early chronic kidney \ndisease has no signs or symptoms and without early detection can progress to \nkidney failure. If a person has high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes or a \nfamily history of kidney failure, the risk of kidney disease is greater. In Nevada, \n10.7 percent of all adults have diabetes, and nearly 33 percent have high blood \npressure. The prevalence of diabetes, heart disease and hypertension is higher for \nAfrican Americans who develop kidney failure at a rate of nearly 4 to 1 compared \nto Caucasians. Hispanics have a 30 percent higher risk of developing kidney failure. \nAlmost  19.5  percent  of  the  people  in  Nevada  waiting  for  a  kidney  identify  as \nAfrican American. In 2019, less than 7 percent of them received a kidney. \n \nAlthough  dialysis  is  a  life-extending  treatment,  the  best  and  most  effective \ntreatment for kidney failure is a kidney transplant. The waitlist in Nevada for a \ndeceased donor kidney is 5 to 7 years; nationally, 12 people die every day waiting. \n \nIf  chronic  kidney  disease  is  detected  early  and  managed  appropriately,  the \nindividual can receive treatment sooner to protect the kidneys, and deterioration of \nkidney  function  can  be  slowed  and  even  stopped.  The  risk  of  associated \ncardiovascular complications and other complications can also be reduced. \n \nIt is imperative to provide support to those with kidney disease in light of the \nCovid-19  pandemic,  the  increased  risk  of  infection  to  patients  with  preexisting \nconditions and Covid-19 patients acquiring acute kidney disease. \n \nThese  are  the  reasons  support  is  needed  for  the  establishment  of  the  Kidney \nDisease Prevention and Education Task Force. There are two main charges for the \nTask  Force  in  the  bill.  First,  to  create  health  education  programs  and \nrecommendations to increase awareness of and examine chronic kidney disease, \ntransplantations, living and deceased kidney donations, and the existing disparity in \nthe rates of those afflicted between Caucasians and minorities. \n \nSecond,  to  develop  a  sustainable  plan  to  raise  awareness  and  early  detection, \npromote health equity and reduce the burden of kidney disease throughout the \nState. This will lead to educating the public about the disease, especially for our \nmore vulnerable populations, resulting in cost savings for the healthcare system \nand improved quality of life. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 48 \n \nThe DHHS is supportive of the public health focus of this proposal. Although there \nmay  be  some  cost,  an  opportunity  for  short-term  investments  has  long-term \nbenefits for the State and Nevadans. \n \nDonna  Spearman  waited  as  long  as  she  could  to  testify  today  in  support  of \nS.B. 341. She is a chronic kidney disease patient and wholeheartedly believes in \nthe benefits of supporting this Task Force. \n \nFRANCO REYNA (National Kidney Foundation): \nI will read from my written testimony (Exhibit AB) in support of S.B. 341. \n \nCINDY VALLETTE (American Kidney Fund): \nI will read from my written testimony (Exhibit AC) in support of S.B. 341. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nDonna Spearman did tell me she wanted to testify today. She has been on dialysis \nfor  three  years  now.  Some  may  remember  when  she  was  helping  me  out \nadministratively. Her stage 3 kidney failure was advancing to stage 4, and she had \nto stop. \n \nKidney disease is a horrible thing for families to go through. One of my younger \nbrothers was diagnosed with stage 3 kidney disease and recently passed away. He \nalso had high blood pressure and had been diagnosed with diabetes. \n \nKidney disease, kidney failure, diabetes and high blood pressure are prevalent in \nBIPOC communities. In 2017 and early 2018, I was getting a checkup at a military \nhospital, and the doctor had me do some lab testing. At the third visit, she told me \nI was at a prediabetic stage and had to lose some weight. I had gained weight due \nto the steroids I was taking for asthma. I immediately changed my food intake and \nwas able to lose weight which brought me back from the brink. \n \nThis is something we can control and help reduce if we focus on it. We keep \ntalking  about  doing  something  about  mental,  emotional  and  physical  health  in \nBIPOC communities. If we do nothing, it is like someone yelling your house is on \nfire and not calling the fire department. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nLooking at the conceptual amendment, Exhibit AA, there are four items. Item 1 \ndeletes sections 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, and 15. Those sections of the bill are identical to \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 49 \n \nanother bill which passed out of the Senate Government Affairs Committee today. \nIf both of these bills pass and get amended in any other form as we go through the \nprocess, the potential is there for a conflict. It is my understanding you wanted to \namend out these sections to avoid that conflict, is that correct? \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThat is correct. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nItem 2, Exhibit AA, deletes the sections relating to the Kidney Disease Prevention \nand Education Task Force and Fund including sections 3, 4, 5, 18 and 19. Based \non your testimony, you would like to strike that part of the amendment and keep \nthe Task Force in, correct? \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThe Task Force is where the fiscal note came in. If we delete the Task Force, it is \nmy understanding the fiscal note will go away, and we can proceed with grant \nfunding from the government and other appropriate agencies. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIf you delete those sections, there will not be a Task Force. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI understand. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDo you want to leave those sections in and keep the Task Force, or do you want to \npull those sections out and take out the Task Force? \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nTake out the Task Force. \n \nMS. BELZ: \nI did speak to DHHS, and it indicated not all of the fiscal note was related to the \nTask Force, only a portion. If the Task Force is removed, it takes out about half of \nthe fiscal note. Also, DHHS said there would be some opportunity to talk about \nwhittling  that  down,  perhaps  based  on  some  changes  in  expectations  of  the \nTask Force, like frequency of meetings, scope of material they would look at as \nwell as some other things. There would still be a fiscal note, but I cannot speak to \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 50 \n \nhow large it would be. The DHHS said it was an important public policy from a \npublic health standpoint, and there would be an opportunity to talk about that. My \nimpression is that it would not remove the fiscal note, just make it smaller. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nWe talked about section 2, applying for available grants from the government and \nother sources. Whatever we have to do to eliminate the fiscal note, scaling back \nsome things and adding others, I am willing to do it. \n \nThis bill is extremely important, and I do not want to take out the portion about \nkidney  disease  education.  At  the  same  time,  we  are  talking  about  part  of  the \nproblem that led to susceptibility for Covid-19 and for increased mortality rates \namong BIPOC communities. I do not know what money may come to Nevada, or \nwhat has already come. If we take out the items where the fiscal note would \nstand, it is my hope that DHHS and DPBH would look at how these communities \nhave been ravaged by Covid-19 and provide something proactive so when the next \npandemic hits, the same communities do not have to pay the same price. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSections 3 and 4 clarify the grant process. The original language in the bill was \nfrom  “any  source,  including  without  limitation,”  which  left  the  impression  that \nDHHS  would  need  to  apply  for  any  grant  that  dropped  in  its  lap  whether \nappropriate for the State or not. By modifying that language to “and other sources” \ninstead of “any,” that removes the other part of the fiscal note. \n \nMy understanding is that sections 3 and 4 remove the fiscal note related to the \ngrant  writing  process,  and  sections  3,  4,  5,  18  and  19  are  related  to  the \nTask Force. \n \nTo clarify, to remove the grant writing portion of the fiscal note, you would like to \nkeep items 3 and 4 on the amendment, as in that modifier changing it to “and \nother sources,” so DHHS is still directed to write grants but not necessarily every \ngrant that comes its way, is that correct? \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThat is correct. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 51 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIf we are instituting a new competitive grant process, work goes along with this \nthat DHHS may want to look at. The creation of a new account, and the fact that \nfunds going into that account are based on the legislation, would revert to the \nState General Fund and carry forward; that is something we do not usually do. \nSection  8,  subsection  1  of  the  bill  creates  a  new  Minority  Health  and  Equity \nAccount  in  the  General  Fund.  For  the  purposes  of  whether  the  bill  goes  to \nSenate Finance, some provisions in this will have to be discussed by the Finance \nCommittee regardless of the provisions we just discussed. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSenator  Spearman,  I  would  leave  the  Task  Force  in  the  bill.  As  indicated  by \nMs. Belz, there is opportunity for a conversation about the degree of the fiscal note \nand what Senator Kieckhefer has mentioned. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nCreating the new account was something brought to me by the Director of the \nOffice of Minority Health and Equity. It was designed to make sure the Office has \nwhat is needed to attack these diseases. We can keep that in the bill and justify \nthe request if it should go to Finance. \n \nI want to ensure these communities get what they should. This bill is a result of \nbeing frustrated last Session because of no way to get money targeted to these \ncommunities, and people are dying. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nItem 1 of the conceptual amendment deletes sections 6, 7, 12, 13, 14 and 15 as \nthey are replicated in another bill. \n \nItem 2 will be put back into the bill. Everything having to do with the Task Force \nwill be added back. \n \nItems 3 and 4 direct DHHS to apply for grants, but not just any grant available, and \nthis removes the fiscal note. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIf we passed this bill in Senate Government Affairs without a fiscal note and we \nput a fiscal note on it, we have not lost anything except the bill will have to go to \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 52 \n \nthe Finance Committee. We need not be afraid of a fiscal note because we have \nanother avenue if something comes up. \n \nCHAIR RATTI:  \nThe sections in item 1 being removed are something different. They have language \nthat talks about how the State appropriates money specifically to health care and \nmakes decisions to ensure the money is correctly appropriated to impact disparate \ncommunities  of  color.  The  sections  being  removed  have  not  been  part  of  the \ndiscussion  so  far.  This  separate  concept  now  lives  in  two  bills  that  we  are \nattempting to make into one bill. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nMy  understanding  of  the  proposed  amendment,  Exhibit  AA,  as  revised  by  the \nsponsor, leaves in sections 16 and 17 which have to do with behavioral health care \nand managed care. We have not talked about those. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN:  \nThe concern from the MCOs is the word strategies, and what strategies speak to. \nWe need to come up with a way to not only treat what is happening now but to \nhave the strategy make sure we reduce the incidence. If another word would give \nthem comfort, I am willing to use that. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWhat is your intent with the language in the bill? \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThe intent is to ensure this bill, along with the bill that passed out of Senate \nGovernment  Affairs,  speaks  to  the  inadequacies  of  the  healthcare  system  we \nexperienced last year. Prior to Covid-19, the healthcare system was still failing \nBIPOC communities. \n \nThe intent is that physical, emotional and behavioral health in BIPOC communities \nbecomes a priority. That includes making sure we identify the issues and strategies \nto help us treat what is here now and reduce the incidence of those diseases at a \nlater date. \n \nREGAN COMIS (Anthem Blue Cross): \nAnthem Blue Cross is neutral on S.B. 341. With regard to section 16 of the bill, we \nhave had a discussion with Senator Spearman and will continue to work on this. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 53 \n \nBETH  HANDLER,  M.P.H.  (Deputy  Director,  Programs,  Department  of  Health  and \nHuman Services): \nThe conceptual amendment, Exhibit AA, which includes the deletion of sections 6, \n7, 12, 13, 14 and 15, is related to the Task Force. We did talk about how the \nTask Force could be reinstated within the bill. \n \nThe revisions to sections 2 and 17 include the language that removes the “any \nsource, including, without limitation” and adds “and other sources” following the \nreference to the federal government. This would allow us to remove the fiscal note \nsubmitted by DPBH. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nBy putting the Task Force back in the bill, the fiscal note associated with that \nwould stay with the bill, correct? \n \nMS. HANDLER: \nThe understanding is that there is staffing within the agency to help support the \nTask Force. The agency would still want to revisit that language. \n \nTINA DORTCH (Program Manager, Office of Minority Health and Equity, Department \nof Health and Human Services): \nI  will  read  from  my  written  testimony  (Exhibit  AD)  in  the  neutral  position  on \nS.B. 341. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will entertain a motion on S.B. 341. \n \nSENATOR  HARDY  MOVED  TO  AMEND  AND  DO  PASS  AS  AMENDED \nS.B. 341. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 341 and open the hearing on S.B. 397. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 54 \n \nSENATE BILL 397: Revises provisions relating to certain persons who remain in \nfoster care beyond the age of 18 years. (BDR 38-502) \n \nSENATOR JAMES OHRENSCHALL (Senatorial District No. 21): \nI will read from my written testimony on S.B. 397 (Exhibit AE) and the proposed \namendment (Exhibit AF). \n \nMS. DUFFY: \nThe Clark County amendment, Exhibit AF, is a product of discussions with child \nwelfare agencies and legal services. This amendment will ensure we are meeting \nfederal requirements to bring down federal matching funds to support the program \nand assist children aging out of foster care. \n \nSection 1 clarifies the State Division of Child and Family Services is the entity that \nwill establish a Title IV-E program for the State. The original bill had an individual \naccounting agency seemingly and potentially in control of that. \n \nSection 2 adds the term “young adult.” This will respect the fact that these people \nare no longer children but are young adults between the ages of 18 to 21 years, \nwho choose to participate in a plan of extended support services. If they initially \ndecline to participate in that plan, they may choose to come back between the \nages of 18 to 21 years to once again participate in the plan. \n \nThis section also defines extended support services and lays out the criteria the \nplan must include, such as education, employment and vocational training, unless \nthe young adult is unable to participate in these areas due to a medical or cognitive \nissue. \n \nSection  4  adds  new  language  to  participate  as  a  young  adult  in  an  extended \nsupport service program as this program will be Title IV-E reimbursable, which is \nthe federal funding we will use. For Clark and Washoe Counties, it is 100 percent \nGeneral Fund to support children aging out of foster care. This bill will change that \nallowing us to pull in Title IV-E federal money much needed by the State. \n \nSection 7 will make the program Title IV-E reimbursable. \n \nSection 1 has the agency creating the plan. Section 2 allows for the direct payment \nof money to foster homes, supervised independent living placement, which can be \nwith relatives or fictive kin, and other Title IV-E placements approved by the federal \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 55 \n \ngovernment.  This  can  also  be  from  payments  made  directly  to  a  vendor  of \napartments or condominiums for mortgage payment, or other providers of housing \nor independent living services. We may also pay the funds directly to the young \nadult. \n \nIf the payments go to a vendor or independent living placement, they may be in full \nor a partial payment. That would mean if rent is $500 a month and the payment is \n$775, we could pay $500 a month to the provider of placement, and the balance \nwould go to the young adult. If the plan is for the young adult to get the payments \ndirectly, he or she must get the full payment. \n \nThe newly added section 7, subsection 4 allows that young adult to alternate \nbetween the three types of payments. If you have children or young adults in your \nlife who move out and you provide them with $500 a month to pay their bills and \nyou find out they are not using the money appropriately, they may need to be \nbrought back into the household. Or perhaps they have come upon a hard time and \nwould rather have someone pay for their basic needs. There are on- and off-ramps \nin order to help young adults become independent. \n \nSection 8 is mostly conforming language to add the term “young adult” in place of \n“child” and “extended youth support services plan” in place of “jurisdiction.” \n \nIn section 8, subsection 4, paragraph (c), we are ensuring young adults retain their \nlegal decision-making authority as adults. Even though they remain under court \njurisdiction and child welfare agencies are still in those young adults’ lives, at the \nsuggestion of our legal aid services, we wanted to make clear they have their own \ndecision-making authority. They are 18- to 21-year-olds; at some point, we have to \nlet go and let them make their own decisions. \n \nSection 8 also ensures our young adults, who have either made an initial decision \nnot  to  participate  in  the  plan  of  extended  support  services  or  at  some  point \nbetween the ages of 18 to 21 may have been terminated from that plan for not \nmeeting the requirements, are able to re-establish the plan. If the young adults \nwant to get back into the system, the statute will require the child welfare agency \nor a contracted agency to assist them. In Clark County, we have Step Up offering \nassistance. We may also refer them to the legal aid service agencies that would \nrepresent young adults. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 56 \n \nSection 9 is conforming to the new terms of “young adult” and “extended support \nservices.” \n \nSection  10  creates  the  judicial  review  process  which  is  a  requirement  for  the \nfederal Title IV-E program. This section would provide for notice of the review \nhearing to young adults and the attorney for them. However, it would not require \nthat the young adult attend the review hearing. It also allows for a court to appoint \na panel to conduct the annual review. \n \nA panel would not be in a traditional courtroom setting. Experts would sit around a \ntable talking about ensuring we are providing the correct services, have input from \nthe young adult’s attorney, and that plan would be reviewed for the reasonable \nefforts the agency is providing to support the youth into adulthood. \n \nThis amendment, Exhibit AF, changes the original bill to create one program with \non- and off-ramps for youth aged 18 to 21. When we were 18 to 21 years old, I \nam sure we all had our struggles financially trying to find our way in life and \nreaching out to our parents or family members for help. We want to do the same \nfor children aging out of the foster care system. It is one program that has children \nwho need to be working, going to school or a vocational program and then having \nthat support as they transition to self-sufficiency at the age of 21. \n \nBAILEY BORTOLIN (Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers): \nOur program, Step Up, the contracted team that works through the County, works \nwell, is something we are proud of and makes a big difference in children’s lives. \n \nAs Senator Ohrenschall mentioned, this started in 2011 before there was a federal \noption to extend foster care. States are doing this in a wide variety of models, and \nwe have looked at those models. Nevada should be proud of what it has been \ndoing and the service work provided to these children when they turn 18 years old. \n \nWe have worked hard to make sure we can draw down that 35 percent match \nfrom the Title IV-E funds and not jeopardize what we are doing to serve these \nchildren. It is our intent to continue to do this work. There are some improvements \nin this bill to the way the structure worked previously. Not every child who reaches \nthe age of 18 wants to sign up to stay in the foster care system and continue to \nreceive help. They may regret that choice, and right now they do not have the \noption to come back if they walk away. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 57 \n \nRespect language in the bill ensures we are treating these children as young adults, \nrespecting their autonomy and assisting them to the best of our abilities. This has \nbeen a team effort, but we have something that has been thoroughly thought \nthrough. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIf we set aside Title IV-E funds shifting to this program, is this better for our \nchildren than the one we now run? \n \nTIMOTHY BURCH (Administrator of Human Services, Department of Family Services, \nClark County): \nWe do believe it is because of the on- and off-ramp modality mentioned earlier, as \nwell as what would fully round out what we are calling extended youth support \nservices. This does allow us to provide more types of services because of the \nreinvestment of the Title IV-E dollars. Youth from the Children’s Advocacy Alliance \nwho toured during the last Legislative Session testified about how they wished \nthey would have had the instructed support at 19 and 20 years old after they had \nmade the decision not to engage in the program. We feel this meets that goal for \nthem. \n \nDASHUN JACKSON (Children’s Advocacy Alliance): \nThe Children’s Advocacy Alliance supports S.B. 397. For many youth and young \npeople entering the foster care system, additional support and guidance is needed \nto ensure the success of transitioning into adulthood. This bill would allow many of \nthe  young  people  who  enter  the  system  at  no  fault  of  their  own  to  gain  the \nadditional support. \n \nMany young people who age out of the foster care system are left without family \nand a strong support system to rely on. This bill will give them the additional time \nto find and develop a support system to help them avoid homelessness or entering \ninto the correctional system. \n \nYoung people who have experienced foster care are like many of us who were not \nready to enter the adult world at the age of 18. If we were not ready, why would \nwe expect them to be at 18 years old after having faced traumatic life adversities? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 58 \n \nAMBER HOWELL (Washoe County): \nWashoe County is in the neutral position on S.B. 397 due to the impact of the \nfiscal note. We appreciate the work done to get to the conceptual amendment, \nExhibit AF. \n \nKATHRYN ROOSE (Deputy Administrator, Quality and Oversight, Division of Child and \nFamily Services, Department of Health and Human Services): \nThe Division of Child and Family Services is in the neutral position on S.B. 397. We \nlike having one program, doing what is best for the young adults aging out of the \nfoster  care  system  and  look  forward  to  continuing  to  work  with \nSenator Ohrenschall and the stakeholders. \n \nSENATOR OHRENSCHALL: \nI will read from my closing statement, Exhibit AE. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will entertain a motion on S.B. 397. \n \nSENATOR  HARRIS  MOVED  TO  AMEND  AND  DO  PASS  AS  AMENDED \nS.B. 397. \n \nSENATOR HARDY SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 397. I asked our Counsel to look into the federal \nauthorization to raise the rates in S.B. 390 and if we would be able to pull in \nlandlines as was requested in some of our public testimony this afternoon. \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nThe current language of the bill is based on a federal law and what federal law \nauthorizes in terms of a surcharge. Federal law only authorizes the surcharge on \nmobile lines, but it appears this is to get around a preemption issue that would \notherwise  prevent  states  from  imposing  a  surcharge  on  mobile  lines.  That \npreemption issue is not applicable to landlines as far as I can tell. It does seem it \nwould work to expand the surcharge to landlines. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 59 \n \nTo clarify, are we including the amendment we spoke about earlier in the vote? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nYes. The motion I am looking for on S.B. 390 is amend and do pass to include \nexpanding the lines to be included in the surcharge to landlines. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN MOVED TO AMEND AND DO PASS AS AMENDED \nS.B. 390. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRemainder of page intentionally left blank, signature page to follow.   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 60 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSeeing no public comment, the meeting is adjourned at 8:37 p.m. \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nVickie Polzien, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 61 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nBegins \nExhibit \nBill   on  Witness / Entity  Description \nLetter \nPage \n  A  1    Agenda \nS.B. 201  B  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 274  C  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 275  D  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 309  E  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 318  F  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 326  G  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 329  H  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 340  I  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 380  J  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 391  K  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 396  L  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nS.B. 376  M  1  Megan Comlossy  Work Session Document \nAttorney General / \nS.B. 390  N  1  Conceptual Amendment \nAaron Ford  \nAttorney General /  Principles for the Use of \nS.B. 390  O  1 \nAaron Ford   Funds from Opioid Litigation \nStephanie Woodard / \nDivision of Public and \nS.B. 390  P  1  Behavioral Health,  988 Presentation \nDepartment of Health \nand Human Services \nS.B. 390  Q  1  Robin Reedy / NAMI  Support Statement \nMary Walker / Carson \nCity; Douglas County;  Support Statement of Alan \nS.B. 390  R  1 \nCarson Tahoe Health  Garrett / Carson Tahoe Health \nSystem \nGerard Keegan / Cellular \nS.B. 390  S  1  Neutral Statement \nTelecommunications \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 8, 2021 \nPage 62 \n \nand Internet \nAssociation \nSenator James A. \nS.B. 325  T  1  Proposed Amendment \nSettelmeyer  \nLiz MacMenamin / \nPre-exposure Prophylaxis \nS.B. 325  U  1  Retail Association of \nArticles \nNevada  \nLiz MacMenamin /  Secondary HIV Prevention by \nS.B. 325  V  1  Retail Association of  U.S. Department of Veterans \nNevada   Affairs \nLiz MacMenamin / \nS.B. 325  W   1  Retail Association of  State Information \nNevada  \nJohn “Rob” Phoenix / \nS.B. 325  X  1  Support Testimony \nHuntridge Family Clinic \nS.B. 325  Y  1  Leana Ramirez  Support Testimony \nKenneth Kunke / \nS.B. 325  Z  1  Nevada Pharmacy  Support Testimony \nAlliance \nS.B. 341  AA  1  Senator Pat Spearman   Conceptual Amendment \nFranco Reyna / National \nS.B. 341  AB  1  Support Statement \nKidney Foundation \nCindy Vallette / \nS.B. 341  AC  1  Support Statement \nAmerican Kidney Fund \nTina Dortch / Office of \nS.B. 341  AD  1  Minority Health and  Neutral Testimony \nEquity \nSenator James \nS.B. 397  AE  1  Written Remarks \nOhrenschall  \nSenator James \nS.B. 397  AF  1  Proposed Amendment \nOhrenschall  \n ", "\nMINUTES OF THE  \nSENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n \nEighty-first Session \nApril 13, 2021 \n \n \nThe Senate Committee on Health and Human Services was called to order by \nChair Julia Ratti at 3:34 p.m. on Tuesday, April 13, 2021, Online.

(BDR 40-329) \n \nHAROLD WICKHAM (Deputy Director, Department of Corrections): \nExisting  law  prohibits  the  charging  of  fees  for  the  issuance  of  copies  of \ncertificates and records of birth to homeless persons and persons released from \nprison within the immediately preceding 90 days. This bill prohibits the charging \nof fees to persons who are imprisoned. \n \nNICK SHEPACK (American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada): \nWe support A.B. 16. It should be the policy of the State to ensure incarcerated \npersons have the tools needed to succeed upon release. Over 90 percent of \nthose incarcerated in the State will get out of prison. To be released without \nnecessary documents such as birth certificates can lead to an untold number of \nissues. When people are released from prison, they are forced to find housing, \nfood and employment. A birth certificate is often needed to obtain these things. \nAssembly Bill 16 is a simple and impactful piece of legislation that will reduce \nrecidivism and increase success rates for Nevada's formerly incarcerated. \n \nWILLIAM PREGMAN (Battle Born Progress): \nWe support A.B. 16. We ditto the previous speaker's remarks. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 13, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nKENDRA BERTSCHY (Deputy Public Defender, Washoe County Public Defender's \nOffice): \nWe support A.B. 16. We echo the comments from the previous speakers. This \nbill  is  an  easy  way  to  provide  our  community  members  with  a  chance  to \nsucceed in the future. \n \nJIM HOFFMAN (Nevada Attorneys for Criminal Justice): \nWe  support  A.B.  16.  We  ditto  the  previous  speakers.  Access  to  birth \ncertificates  is  a  small  investment  but  can  have  a  huge  impact  for  both \nincarcerated people and the community at large. \n \nJODI HOCKING (Founder, Return Strong): \nWe  support  A.B.  16.  My  husband  was  incarcerated  at  the  Department  of \nCorrections (DOC). He was impacted by this exact issue. He, among others, \nwas released after winning a lawsuit on A.B. No. 510 of the 74th Session. \nAfter being institutionalized and having post-traumatic stress disorder, it led him \nto get into a fight. This resulted in a violation and return to prison. He came \nhome from prison with no identification or birth certificate and could not be \nfound in vital statistics. We still do not know why, as he went to school in \nNevada,  was  in  prison  in  Nevada  and  yet  was  nonexistent.  We  have  been \nasking DOC for two years to help us find his birth certificate. The reality of not \nhaving a birth certificate made it impossible for him to get health insurance or \nemployment. This issue could have been resolved before he came home. People \nneed to prove their identity as soon as they walk out of prison. It is necessary \nto find jobs and integrate into society. You cannot do that if you cannot prove \nwho you are. \n \nJOHN PIRO (Deputy Public Defender, Clark County Public Defender's Office): \nWe support A.B. 16. We can verify people's identity enough to lock them away \nfor years, yet we do not provide them with a document when they get out of \nprison to identify themselves and rehabilitate their lives. This is a great measure. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will entertain a motion on A.B. 16.  \n \nSENATOR HARRIS MOVED TO DO PASS A.B. 16. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 13, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will open the hearing on Senate Concurrent Resolution (S.C.R.) 5. \n \nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 5: Urges certain actions to address the \npublic health crisis in Nevada. (BDR R-966) \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \n\"Prejudice is a burden that confuses the past, threatens the future and renders \nthe present inaccessible.\" These are the words of Maya Angelou. Prejudice has \ncontributed  to  the  creation  of  systemic  racism  and  structures  of  racial \ndiscrimination  that  result  in  generational  poverty  and  perpetuate  debilitating \neconomic,  educational  and  health  challenges.  This  disproportionately  affects \npeople of color. Senate Concurrent Resolution 5 takes a step toward addressing \nthis  systemic  racism  and  structures  of  racial  discrimination  and  their \ndisproportionate  impact  on  people  of  color  in  the  Covid-19  era.  For  these \nreasons and others, S.C.R. No. 1 of the 32nd Special Session was adopted \ndeclaring systemic racism and structures of racial discrimination constitute a \npublic health crisis. \n \nLast week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Center stated racism \nis a public health crisis. We have talked about it a long time, but it is now time \nto act on solutions designed to deconstruct this poison in our society. Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 5 declares all Nevada residents have equal consideration \nand opportunity under the law, policies and practices of the State. \n \nNevada  supports  local,  State,  regional  and  federal  initiatives  to  understand, \naddress and dismantle systemic racism. Federal funding should be distributed \nequitably based on the portion of members of Black, Indigenous and People of \nColor  (BIPOC)  communities.  This  would  address  issues  disproportionately \naffecting  those  communities  in  direct  proportion  to  their  disadvantage  by \nindividual racial category. I have asked professionals to join me today who have \nworked on various community projects including: Shawn Rochester, who has \nexperience working in corporate America and has authored The Black Tax: The \nCost of Being Black in America; Dr. Kara Freeman, professional dietician; Alisa \nHoward who has worked with community health care for the last nine years; \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 13, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nTina  Dortch  from  the  Office  of  Minority  Health  and  Equity;  Pastor  Karen \nAnderson of the First African Methodist Episcopal Church in Las Vegas; and \nYindra  Dixon,  a  community  and  organizing  activist  in  our  community  and \nprincipal of Blackbox Consulting. \n \nSHAWN ROCHESTER: \nWhen people talk about discrimination, they tend to focus on the injustice or the \nimmorality  associated  with  discrimination.  I  look  at  the  economic  cost  of \ndiscrimination and what the research from the finest institutions in the Country \nsay about that cost. The research examines the cost in the modern-day context. \nIt lays out where we are as a Nation with Black people owning about 2 percent \nof U.S. wealth and lays out an economic case for how we can create millions of \njobs  and  businesses  and  provide  missing  capital  in  Black  communities.  It \npromotes  ways  leading  to  better  health  and  educational  outcomes.  Wealth \naffects  educational  and  health  outcomes,  trauma  and  other  issues  it \nexacerbates. \n \nThe cost of discrimination emanates from conscious and unconscious bias from \ninstitutions,  individuals,  organizations  and  corporations.  One  of  the  first \nquestions to ask is what levels of bias and anti-Black bias exist in the Country \ntoday.  Work  has  been  done  at  major  universities  that  examined  levels  of \nanti-Black bias across the American electorate. Research found 51 percent of \nAmericans  have  automatic  White  preference;  this  is  another  way  of  saying \nanti-Black bias. \n \nI want to discuss housing issues. As a Black person, you will be told about and \nshown 20 percent fewer homes. When you apply for a mortgage, your credit \nrating  will  be  up  to  71  points  lower.  When  you  apply  for  the  loan,  it  is \n60 percent more likely to be denied with the same credit profile as a White peer. \nThe Black person is likely to receive higher closing costs, and the appreciation in \nhome  equity  is  substantially  lower.  When  selling  your  home,  there  is  an \nappraisal gap typically much lower on your home. These are massive, significant \nmaterial economic costs. \n \nDiscrimination  or  racial  bias  also  shows  up  in  the  labor  market.  Research \nindicates that resumes with a White-sounding name receive 50 percent more \ncallbacks versus the same resume with a Black-sounding name. A White felon \nwith that resume has a higher callback ratio than a Black college graduate. This \nhas a significant impact on high-end careers. When it comes to capital-raising \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 13, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nfor business, Black owners pay 100 basis points higher for their business loans. \nA Black business owner with superior credit pays higher interest rates than his \nor her White peer. Bias shows up both in conscious and unconscious ways and \nhas an economic and discriminatory impact. \n \nLooking  at  resources  distributed  through  the  G.I.  Bill  since  1944,  less  than \n2 percent  went  to  Black  people.  The  1862  Homestead  Act,  funds  given  to \nAmericans to start a great life, went to 99.7 percent White Americans. Between \n1930 and 1960, less than 1 percent of mortgages in the Country went to Black \nAmericans  because  of  the  Federal  Housing  Administration  redlining  practice. \nGoods and services during the same time period were three times higher for \nBlack communities. The impact from a historical perspective and what is still \nhappening now has led to Black Americans owning about 2 percent of the U.S. \nwealth. Anti-Black bias is far higher than we all want or realize. The impact, \nboth present and past, has been draconian. This has also had a massive impact \non the Country. \n \nKARA FREEMAN, DRPH (Nevada Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics): \nI am speaking as the State Policy Representative and President-Elect for the \nNevada  Academy  of  Nutrition  and  Dietetics.  I  am  a  registered \ndietitian/nutritionist and will be addressing the health disparities found in the \nAfrican-American  population.  My  written  presentation  has  been  submitted \n(Exhibit B). \n \nALISA HOWARD (Owner, Minority Health Consultants): \nI am the owner of Minority Health Consultants, a woman-owned public health \nconsulting  firm,  and  I  am  also  a  college  instructor  who  teaches  community \nhealth work. My written presentation has been submitted (Exhibit C). \n \nTINA  DORTCH  (Program  Manager,  Office  of  Minority  Health  and  Equity, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nI will address how the concept of proportional allocation framed within S.C.R. 5 \nreflects in S.B. 302 and S.B. 341. I have submitted my written presentation \ndiscussing these issues (Exhibit D). \n \nSENATE BILL 302: Revises provisions relating to governmental administration. \n(BDR 18-171) \n \nSENATE BILL 341: Revises provisions relating to health care. (BDR 40-62) \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 13, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nKAREN ANDERSON (Senior Pastor, First African Methodist Episcopal Church): \nWe have listened to how poverty and racism have had a disparate effect on \ncommunities of color. The issue of structural racism has been shown to be \nexacerbated during Covid-19. It has been imperative to work toward equity in \nour society. Our focus has always been on meeting the spiritual, emotional and \nphysical needs of all people. \n \nFaith has played a critical and central role in the life of the BIPOC community. \nWe are often the place where people come when they have a need not being \naddressed by our government. We are the stopgap. Pastors are the ones who \nare often the first point of contact in a community and make up the difference \nwhen there is a financial need. We are there for emotional and physical needs. \nWe are there when there is a housing need. We have seen what has happened \nwith Covid-19 and the disparate distribution of wealth. \n \nPeople are always calling for peace, and we think of peace as the absence of \nconflict. Peace in the Hebrew bible means the absence of justice. We will never \nhave peace in our Nation until we have justice. Justice should not be based on \nrace, class, ethnicity, gender-loving preference or religious affiliation. We are all \ncreated equal in the eyes of God. We must be those who seek to ensure every \nmember of our community has access to what one needs. \n \nI have met with members who have struggled because of unemployment, lack \nof child care, food security and the inability to access needed services. We have \ncounseled families who are struggling with emotional trauma from the loss of \nloved ones for whom they could not afford the burial costs. Students are being \nadversely affected, and their grades have dropped during the pandemic. It is \nimperative for us to build a community where the life of every human being has \nvalue, respect and dignity. We must ensure equitable distribution of wealth and \nopportunities for us to move forward. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nWe want to lay the foundation and show how the distribution of monies for \nhealth care affects our communities all the way around. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThere is historical inequity in our society and institutions that had an exponential \nimpact  as  time  passed.  We  have  made  progress,  but  in  other  ways,  the \nCovid-19  pandemic  has  shown  a  light  on  many  ways  we  have  not  made \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 13, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nprogress.  You  are  making  a  policy  recommendation  for  moving  forward  on \nproportionate allocation of resources, and that is one policy strategy. Are there \nother policy recommendations you would want the Legislature to be aware of \nthat  can  specifically  address  the  wealth  and  equities  leading  to  health \ninequities? \n \nMR. ROCHESTER: \nI  want  to  talk  about  frameworks  by  which  we  could  measure  the  efficacy \nimpact of policies and plans that may ultimately be put in place. There are \nmassive gaps when it comes to jobs, businesses and wealth. Policies and plans \nneed to have a direct stimulative impact within the Black community on the \nfollowing: job creation, business formation and expansion, capital availability, \nand  affordability.  The  driving  communities,  enclaves  and  ecosystems  we  all \nwant  cannot  be  built  in  an  infrastructure  with  a  gap  in  jobs,  business  and \ncapital.  \n \nWe  need  to  have  an  ecosystem  approach  and  look  at  creating  effective \ncommunities dealing with economic deprivation. As companies are formed and \nreal estate developed, they are not utilizing the local products and services of \nthe businesses within the community. You can have a coordinated effort among \nvery  different  parties  sharing  a  similar  intention.  It  needs  to  be  directly \nstimulative  to  jobs,  businesses  and  capital  within  the  Black  community  in \nparticular. The healthcare infrastructure is critical. We have the worst health, \naccess to health care and treatment. \n \nYINDRA DIXON (Managing Partner, Blackbox Consulting Group LLC): \nI  have  submitted  written  testimony  to  address  the  concept  of  proportional \nallocation framed within S.C.R. 5 (Exhibit E). \n \nDENNIS CREARY (President, CEO, Blacks on Wall Street, Inc.): \nThere has to be something various communities could and should do to address \ndisparities and systemic pressures our communities have been under globally for \n400 years and beyond. In 1948, a bill and act passed in the United Kingdom \n(U.K.), where I am from, stated regardless of people's stations in life, their most \nprecious gift was their health. The National Health System was started as a \nresult. A system such as the one in the U.K. does not exist in the U.S. An \nindividual who is poor or destitute can become even much more so if ill. You \ncan be the wealthiest individual in the U.S. or the poorest individual, but if you \ndo not have your health, you cannot function in your particular station in life. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 13, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nIn  1919,  at  the  onset  of  the  Spanish  flu,  frontline  workers  were \ndisproportionately  affected  and  unrecorded,  as  men  were  Black  and  Brown \nindividuals. Fast forwarding 100 years later to this particular pandemic, we have \nnot learned anything from history. Frontline workers are still Black and Brown \nand disproportionately affected. To address your question, if there are other \nmeasures made to address disproportionate wealth, which has been systemic in \nBlack  and  Brown  communities,  health  is  first  and  foremost.  If  you  are \ndisproportionately affected, you should be compensated accordingly. I want to \nlend my support to Senator Spearman.  \n \nDr. Randall W. Maxey, world-renowned nephrologist, has been running a weekly \nglobal program talking about Covid's effects in Black communities around the \nworld. He had planned to be here but was called into surgery just before this \nmeeting. Dr. Maxey is supportive of this measure. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nPastor  Anderson  wants  to  ensure  there  are  more  credentialed  minority \nproviders, especially when dealing with mental and emotional health. We have \nnot done well with this issue.  \n \nPASTOR ANDERSON: \nOne of the important keys is to understand partnering with the faith community \ncan help as we begin to move into neighborhoods. We have access to those in \nthe community. We are the first to hear what they are going through. We do \nknow there is a need for mental and emotional health services. It is important to \ntap into and access the faith community that has a desire to see our community \nmove forward. Another way to help are policies. In St. Louis, Missouri, one of \nthe programs they instituted was in communities of color, particularly in the \neducational  system.  As  children  come  into  kindergarten,  they  start  a  bank \naccount with $50. We have not been taught how to manage money. Policy can \nbe  investing  in  our  children,  not  just  in  their  education  but  also  financially \nhelping them move out of the poverty in which they exist. There are programs \npartnering  with  banks  to  teach  financial  literacy  to  children  as  young  as \nkindergarten age. Sometimes, we wait until high school; by that time, many of \nour children have been lost. \n \nThe faith community can be a strong help. We are seeing a rise in mental health \nand depression. I do not have all the information for what is available, but we \nknow we need more mental health services in school. As these children go back \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 13, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nto school, more counseling services will be needed. Teachers who have been \nstudying distance-learning teaching, spinning on a dime to create educational \nprograms to keep kids interested, also need counseling. There is a lot of work to \nbe done. We need to invest in our education to make sure we have available \nresources. We also need to partner with church communities. We offer space to \nbuild a counseling center directly in the neighborhood. Transit is also an issue \nfor many people living in our community as many are unable to travel across \ntown for services they need. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSenator Dina Neal developed a wonderful program called Nevada Grow that \nspeaks to some of the things Mr. Rochester spoke about including investing in \ncommunities and building an ecosystem. The good news is we have a program \nthat puts $50 into kindergarteners' accounts. The bad news is I do not know if \npeople understand it or if we are not connecting with people about the program. \nRather than build 50 new programs, we need to conduct an inventory of the \nprograms  we  already  have  on  the  books.  We  need  to  make  sure  we  are \nconnecting those programs to communities of color and using spokespeople to \nconnect communities to existing programs. \n \nI have a northern Nevada friend who put a lot of work into creating financial \ncoaching programs taking place at a church after the sermon. People worked on \nfinancial literacy and learned tools to build assets and wealth. It was a powerful \nprogram. There are wonderful things happening, and it is about how we connect \nthe dots to inform people about these types of programs. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI am thrilled to hear where this is going and where some people have been. I \nrecognize in this pandemic we have had challenges with getting vaccines. It is \ncritical we enlist the faith-based organizations to ensure we get people their \nvaccines, especially those who are at risk, frontliners or have diseases. The \njuxtaposition of vaccines and the people who know and live in the community is \ncritical. The vaccine illustrates we have not really taken advantage of the people \nin the neighborhood. \n \nKATIE ROE RYAN (Dignity Health–St. Rose Dominican): \nWe support S.C.R.  5. Health  inequities  and systemic racism have caused a \npublic health crisis. Dignity Health-St. Rose Dominican is addressing systematic \ninequities  experienced  by  BIPOC  and  other  underserved  communities  and \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 13, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nreversing  the  effects  of  systematic  racism  which  require  a  long-term \ncommitment. Our first steps include expanding access to care in underserved \ncommunities, improving how we track outcomes by race, expanding implicit and \nunconscious bias training, growing programs which impact social causes of poor \nhealth  and  further  diversifying  our  leadership.  One  example  is  our  ten-year \npartnership with Morehouse School of Medicine to develop and train more Black \nphysicians. \n \nDignity  Health-St.  Rose  Dominican  also  pays  close  attention  to  the  social \ndeterminants of health as the social causes of poor health need to be dealt with \nthe same velocity as acute medical conditions. Some of these issues include \nhousing, food security, violence prevention and access to culturally competent \ncare. We vow to be a partner in the fight to make sure health care is equitable \nfor all. \n \nANDRE WADE (Silver State Equality): \nWe support S.C.R. 5. Silver State Equality takes an intersexual approach to the \nwork we do and our concern about the compounding impact of racism as a \npublic health issue. We urge you to pass this resolution to improve the health \nand well-being of Nevadans. Black, Indigenous and People of Color tend to be at \nthe bottom of positive health outcome measures and when you consider LGBTQ \nidentities, it is doubly so. \n \nALYSSA LACAP: \nI support S.C.R. 5. I am a student at University of Nevada, Las Vegas, a person \nof color and an intern for the American Heart Association. This is the kind of \nwork and policy we would like to see more often. Racism has a huge effect on \npublic health. I have seen many friends, who are people of color, struggle this \npast year due to Covid-19. I have seen many lives lost. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nWe need help with mental and emotional health. Pastor Anderson, can you \nspeak  to  some  of  the  things  you  walked  into  in  Ferguson,  Missouri,  after \nMichael Brown's murder? \n \nPASTOR ANDERSON: \nYou are correct. We need a lot of mental and emotional help. Many people who \nlive  in  BIPOC  communities  live  in  what  we  consider  to  be  toxic  stress \nenvironments,  whether  it  is  due  to  a  lack  of  food,  safety  or  health-related \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 13, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nissues. Waking up as a person of color and not knowing when you will see on \nthe news as the next person whose life has been taken evokes memories of not \njust that one loss but every loss you have experienced. For many, it takes them \nall the way back to before the death of Treyvon Martin in Florida. \n \nIn  Ferguson,  faith-communities  worked  along  with  minority  mental-health \nprofessionals to bring mental health into the communities. We set up tents and \nhad mental-health professionals there. This allowed people to stop by and talk \nabout  what  they  were  going  through.  We  also  provided  opportunities  for \nluncheons where we paid for parents who had lost children to violence and \ncould come together. We brought professionals from counseling and spiritual \ncare in to speak with them. Together, they would have a community to build \nrelationships. We sent counselors into the school systems. It was intense work \nand done closely with the faith community. The faith community can help get \ninformation out. I was not aware of some programs mentioned earlier and am \nsure our constituents are not aware. It is a wonderful opportunity to partner. \n \nSome of those children in Ferguson, particularly because of what happened with \nthe militarized policing, have been traumatized to the point where they cannot \ntolerate loud sounds anymore due to the tear gas and flash bangs they heard. \nWe do not know what causes trauma in young people and children. We do \nknow it is often expressed in ways we do not understand. Sometimes, those \nchildren we think are hyperactive are really suffering from depression. Children \nwho act out in classrooms are often suffering from depression. It is imperative \nwe  have  health  professionals  who  understand  the  difference  between \ndepression in adults versus children. We also worked hard in St. Louis, Missouri, \nto move resource officers out of schools and move in more counselors who \ncould work with students and teach them de-escalation techniques. To move \nfrom retributive to restorative justice practices is essential as we look at things \nwe can do. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI will never know what it feels like as a mother to send my son off to school or \nwork without worrying. I will not know what it feels like when my brothers and \nnephews  are  not  home,  whether  they  are  here  or  some  other  part  of  the \nCountry. I would like to know that. The mental and emotional stress has a direct \neffect on the physical body. If you have not been familiarized with some of the \ntrauma and the day-to-day stress of being Black, Latin, Indigenous or anyone \nwho is a person of color in America, please listen to our hearts. It is hurting. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 13, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nAlthough  this  is  a  resolution,  I  want  this  to  serve  as  a  blueprint  to  move \nforward, especially when it comes to caring for those who have lost loved ones \nduring Covid-19. \n \nA few weeks ago my brother died very suddenly, and those of us who did not \nlive in Indiana were not able to go. I remember that day watching his service \nonline. Covid-19 has taught us a different way of living and a different way of \ndying. That, on top of what we have already experienced in disparities with \nhealth care, has been compounded. We may not know the total wreckage of \nwhat has taken place in our communities, but I am asking everyone to please \nhear our hearts and help us, please. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nA step we can take today is to support S.C.R. 5, and I am prepared to do a \nwork session on this resolution. I first want to acknowledge a resolution is \nimportant and meaningful work. It is a statement we need to make. I want to \nthank  Ms. Dortch  for  connecting  the  work  of  S.C.R.  5  into  S.B.  302  into \nS.B. 341 and acknowledge we are attempting to do this work in an imperfect \nsystem and world. We have the reality of trying to pass good policy and making \na  difference  during  a  Session  generally  not  offering  the  kind  of  time  we \ngenerated  today.  The  next  step  is  the  hard  work  of  making  sure  we  pass \nS.C.R. 5 out of this Committee. Both S.B. 302 and S.B. 341 will go the Senate \nCommittee on Finance. The pace in the Committee on Finance is significantly \ndifferent than the pace in this Committee. Our Committee today can stand by \nthe statement and pass it out of Committee. We can say we have identified the \nright problem and, globally, what is in this resolution, is correct. To make a \ndifference, we need to work together to make sure the technical process of \ngetting bill language to accomplish what we need to do is the next step. I will \nentertain a motion of S.C.R. 5. \n \nSENATOR HARDY MOVED TO ADOPT S.C.R. 5. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 13, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will now open the hearing on A.B. 35. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 35: Revises provisions governing certain programs to assist \nsenior citizens and persons with disabilities with costs relating to health \ncare. (BDR 40-288) \n \nDENA SCHMIDT (Administrator, Aging and Disability Services Division, Department \nof Health and Human Services): \nThe intent of A.B. 35 is to consolidate the senior and disability prescription drug \nprograms to remove the lengthy income and eligibility requirements as well as to \nalign the definitions of \"senior\" and \"persons with disability\" in NRS 427A. I \nhave submitted a written presentation (Exhibit F). Our Social Services Chief, \nJeff Duncan, will walk you through the specific highlights throughout the bill. \n \nJEFFREY DUNCAN (Social Services Chief, Aging and Disability Services Division, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nI  have  submitted  a  written  presentation  with  all  of  the  specific  highlights \nthroughout A.B. 35, Exhibit F. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIs there a cap on the age for the income as we merge the two programs? \n \nMS. SCHMIDT: \nWe will still have an age cap. We are aligning the age cap with all of our other \nprograms in our definition of senior citizens. The income cap will come out of \nstatute, and we will use the regulatory process to adopt a new income standard \nbased on community input and community need. The Medicare Part D program \nhas completely changed the intent of this program. This program was developed \nin statute before Medicare Part D existed. A lot of our Medicare recipients have \ncompletely different needs now. We want the ability to build a program which \nwraps around current Medicare benefits and provides a better benefit than we \nare able to do with these limitations. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWill that help people with their donut hole, which is a temporary limit on what \nthe Medicare prescription drug plan will pay for prescription drug costs? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 13, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nMS. SCHMIDT: \nYes.  The  donut  hole  has  been  removed  so  their  copayments  are  the  same \nthroughout the process. Oftentimes, one of the barriers is the copayment. Our \nprogram does not cover the copayment. We would like to have the ability to \nadopt regulations to wrap around the Medicare plans existing today. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIn one place, section 13 says \"62 years of age,\" and another place in the bill \nsays \"60 years of age.\" Is the bill still going to be 62 years of age? \n \nMR. DUNCAN: \nSection 13 makes a conforming change to ensure the amendments made by \nsection 6 in the bill do not inadvertently affect certain other programs calling out \n62  years  of  age  or  older  specific  to  NRS 439.650.  Section  6  of  this  bill \nredefines the term \"senior citizen\" to mean a person who is 60 years of age or \nolder for the purposes of the consolidated program. \n \nCHARLIE SHEPARD (AARP): \nWe support A.B. 35. Nevada's older adults and persons with disabilities want to \nremain living at home. The Fund for a Healthy Nevada provides a variety of \nservices  helping  seniors  and  persons  with  disabilities  maintain  their \nindependence and health. This bill removes current restrictions and allows the \nprograms to meet the needs in the community. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nIs there a strategy for partnering with faith-based organizations to advise people \nabout the programs so they can participate? \n \nMS. SCHMIDT: \nHistorically, this program has been limited in funding, and we have not done a \nlot of outreach which has been challenging. We have been working hard to \nfigure out ways to partner and coordinate across all our programs as we do \noutreach. Adopting new regulations is done through a regulatory process, which \nis a public process. We will absolutely make sure we reach out to faith-based \norganizations to ensure participation in the process and ensure people are aware \nof these meeting. \n \nSeniors and people with disabilities still have prescription drug needs and high \ncosts related to those prescriptions. Our goal is to adopt regulations to meet \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 13, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nthose new needs which are different than what they used to be. It used to be \nMedicare had astronomical costs for their prescriptions, then Part D came, then \nthe copays, then the donut hole. Yes, it has changed over time. We intend to do \na lot of community outreach and partner with Ms. Dortch from the Office of \nMinority  Health  and  Equity  to  make  sure  we  hear  from  everyone  in  all \ncommunities and build a program to meet those needs.  \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI have the contact information for Pastor Anderson to do a direct outreach to \nfaith-based communities if you would like to have it. \n \nMS. SCHMIDT: \nAbsolutely. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRemainder of page intentionally left blank; signature page to follow. \n   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 13, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe will close the hearing on A.B. 35.

(BDR 40-740) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN CLARA THOMAS (Assembly District No. 17): \nI will read from my written testimony (Exhibit B) which references the report on \n“Racial/Ethnic  Disparities  in  Pregnancy-Related  Deaths—United  States, \n2007-2016” (Exhibit C), and the presentation on Disparate Impacts of Severe \nMaternal Morbidity and Maternal Mortality on People of Color in Nevada from \nthe Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) (Exhibit D). \n \nEDINA FLAATHEN: \nIn 2008, my husband and I were happy to find out we were expecting a baby \ngirl. I went through much of my pregnancy with prenatal care, joyfully prepping \nfor the arrival of our daughter. I had been ill for much of the pregnancy and \nattributed it to morning sickness. I began to notice swelling in my feet and \nankles and asked my obstetrician if this was normal. He stated it was hereditary \nand that my mother may have also had swollen hands and feet when she was \npregnant. As a new mother, I was reading any information I could on pregnancy \nand this did not sound normal to me, but took what she said as truth.  \n \nTwo  weeks  before  my  due  date,  I  saw  a  new  nurse  practitioner  who  was \nconcerned about the swelling and ordered bloodwork and a 24-hour urine test. \nThe next day, I received a call telling me I had preeclampsia and needed to \ndeliver my baby. I went as long as possible attempting to deliver on my own, \nbut ultimately, my blood pressure rose, and our baby was delivered via cesarean \nsection. If not for the practitioner's care and quick thinking, I would have been \nin grave danger. \n \nIn  2010,  I  delivered  a  healthy  baby  with  no  complications  and  had  what  I \nthought was a perfect delivery until I became pregnant with my third child. I had \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 22, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nonce again been sick throughout the pregnancy, but all seemed well until an \nultrasound revealed I had placenta previa. As a precaution, I was monitored \nevery  2  weeks  and  at  27  weeks  experienced  some  concerning  pain.  My \nhusband  took  me  to  the  hospital  where  tests  were  taken  to  figure  out  the \nsource of the pain. I started early labor which was controlled with medication.  \n \nMy high-risk physician was concerned I had been bleeding internally and later \nfound my uterus had ruptured due to a poor surgical procedure with my second \nchild. The delivering physician said it was a miracle I lived. I lost over two liters \nof blood and needed several transfusions. Other than an early delivery, my son \nhas grown into a spunky child with no developmental issues. Due to the work of \nthe delivering physician, I was able to get pregnant a fourth time and delivered a \nhealthy baby girl who is 11 months old.  \n \nI am thankful for the doctors who did not push my concerns aside and provided \nme with the appropriate care.  \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nAre there any specific areas or policies we should look at? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN THOMAS: \nWe are giving the Maternal Mortality Review Committee (MMRC) the mandate \nto assess the information for disparities among our Black and Indigenous women \nwho will die or have complications from pregnancy-related issues. The DHHS \ncan provide any detailed information you would need to assess this provision so \nMMRC can collect the data. If we do not have the data, we cannot access the \ntools required to submit or legislate policy.  \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI continue to hear about cultural competency training while in medical school. \nThere is cultural competency, and there is the culture of medicine. Sometimes \nthe two do not agree. Would that policy help? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN THOMAS: \nRight now, that is one of the biggest issues we have in medicine. Many of our \nhealthcare providers are not looking at women of color. They are putting us all \nin the same category which should not happen. We have different lifestyles, \ngrew up differently, and have differences in the nature of our background and \nheritage,  our  living  conditions  and  the  food  we  eat.  With  Black  and \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 22, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nBrown women, we have a tendency toward diabetes and high blood pressure. \nAll of these should be taken into consideration when looking at and evaluating \nour health conditions.  \n \nMany of the maternal mortality committees I have spoken with have the biggest \nproblem when it comes to providing information to healthcare providers and the \ncommunity in general. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nBased on the presentation from DHHS, Exhibit D, we now have a lot of this \ndata. Would it be fair to look at the bill as including that data to contextualize \nwhat is already in statute—that the MMRC needs to develop recommendations \nfor preventing maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity? Will this bill \ndrive  the  policy  framing  the  debate  to  have  policies  more  specific  to  these \ndisparities? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN THOMAS: \nYes. Because the MMRC exists, they would incorporate and extract data so the \nLegislature can enact policy going forward. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nOne data set not included in the report from DHHS is geographic-based data. \nHas that data been collected, or was it not included in this report? \n \nKYRA MORGAN (Chief Biostatistician, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nWe do have the available data; it was not included in the summary provided. \n \nKATIE ROBBINS (Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada): \nPlanned Parenthood Votes Nevada supports A.B. 119. The United States has \nthe  highest  maternal  mortality  rate  among  similarly  wealthy  countries  with \nBlack women  having  a  maternal  mortality  rate  of  double  their  White \ncounterparts. This statistic is unacceptable.  \n \nWe applaud the MMRC for taking steps to research and address these issues in \nNevada so we can make childbirth a safer process for everyone, no matter your \nrace or socio-economic status. Planned  Parenthood Votes Nevada welcomes \nthese changes to the MMRC and looks forward to working together to address \nthe disparities in our healthcare system. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 22, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nARIELLE EDWARDS (City of North Las Vegas): \nThe City of North Las Vegas supports A.B. 119. The City knows the maternal \nmortality  rate  showcases  significant  and  widening  disparities  in  maternal \nmortality and morbidity, especially in the Black and Indigenous communities of \ncolor. \n \nWe believe the MMRC is essential in an important effort to ensure the maternal \nmortality rate trends downward in Nevada. We urge the support and passage of \nA.B. 119. \n \nSARAH ADLER (Nevada Advanced Practice Nurses Association): \nThe  Nevada  Advanced  Practice  Nurses  Association  (NAPNA)  extends  its \nappreciation and support to the bill sponsor for bringing A.B. 119 in its amended \nform.  I  would  like  to  thank  the  bill’s  sponsor,  and  her  daughter,  for  their \ncompelling testimony that shines a spotlight on why this bill is so important. \n \nThere are members of NAPNA who specialize in maternal health and obstetrics \nproviding care to Nevadans of all demographic groups. The work of the MMRC \nis important to advance practice registered nurses in their practice. \n \nMoreover, NAPNA is highly focused on the health of Nevadans from a public \nhealth perspective; the research, analysis, and collaboration among healthcare \nproviders, the MMRC, and the Advisory Committee of the Office of Minority \nHealth  and  Equity  that  A.B.  119  assures  will  occur.  That  collaboration  will \nproduce  data  on  which  priorities  or  public  health  policy,  action  and  needed \nfunding can be focused. \n \nDASHUN JACKSON (Children's Advocacy Alliance): \nThe  Children’s  Advocacy  Alliance  supports  A.B.  119.  The  development  of \nMMRC will ensure all mothers and youth are being taken care of. \n \nAMBER FALGOUT: \nI am the northern Nevada manager for Battle Born Progress who is in support of \nA.B.  119.  I  am  also  a  mother  and  have  two  biological  children  including  a \nfour-month  old.  During  the  pregnancy  with  my  four-month  old,  I  had \ncomplications  and  know  what  can  happen.  It  is  incredibly  frightening  and \ndifficult  to  work  through.  We  must  find  out  everything  we  need  to  know \npertaining to women of color going through any stage of pregnancy. We must \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 22, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \npush  for  accurate  data  to  change  the  outcomes  we  are  seeing  with  those \npopulations. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 119 and open the hearing on A.B. 426. \n \nASSEMBLY  BILL  426:  Makes  various  changes  relating  to  the  protection  of \nchildren. (BDR 38-516) \n \nGABRIELLE CARR (Court Master, Sixth Judicial District Court): \nThe Nevada Supreme Court Community Improvement Program is a Statewide \nprogram  that  coordinates  with  every  district  within  the  State  to  improve \noutcomes for families in child abuse and neglect situations. I have supplied a \ncopy of the subcommittee member and participant list (Exhibit E) which contains \napproximately 45 stakeholders throughout the State. This list includes judicial \nofficers,  administrators,  child  welfare  workers,  attorneys  and  a  large \ndemographic of stakeholders who deal with child abuse and neglect cases. This \nsubcommittee unanimously agreed to the proposed changes presented in A.B. \n426. \n \nIn  addition,  you  have  a  memorandum  (Exhibit  F)  regarding  the  summary \noverview  of  A.B.  426.  This  is  a  brief  summary  of  why  we  need  the \nrecommended  changes  to  Nevada  Revised  Statutes  (NRS)  432B.  It  was  an \nopportunity to give a comprehensive overview to a Statewide approach with \nlarge and rural jurisdictions being heard and address those changes to the law \nneeded to improve the way these cases are handled. \n \nThere is a new statutory provision related to warrants. A Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals case indicates Statewide that there is no law making it uniform for a \nchild  welfare  agency  to  remove  a  child  from  a  home  where  a  warrant  is \nnecessary. The purpose of that case is to make it more uniform in how the \ncourts implement that requirement. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThere was an amendment referred to earlier, which the Committee is not aware \nof. Was this about the bill itself and the changes it is making, or is there an \nadditional document with additional changes we should be looking at? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 22, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nBUFFY OKUMA (Chief Deputy District Attorney, Washoe County): \nYesterday,  we  were  provided  with  an  amendment  that  has  not  yet  been \npresented. This amendment is likely coming from Kendra Bertschy, which we do \nsupport. \n \nThe  Clark  County  Juvenile  Probation  Office  wanted  us  to  clarify  section  1, \nsubsection  3,  paragraph  (d)  which  provides  for  a  warrant  to  direct  law \nenforcement and others, if necessary, to assist the child welfare agency to \nprovide  safety  when  executing  a  warrant.  They  were  concerned  that  the \njuvenile probation officers in their area do not carry weapons and would not \nnecessarily be in a position to assist with executing a warrant. \n \nThis  section  says  “may”  which  gives  the  court  the  discretion  over  who  it \nauthorizes  to  execute  the  warrant.  We  want  to  leave  the  possibility  there \nbecause  it  may  be  appropriate  for  juvenile  probation  to  assist  in  some \njurisdictions, and in other jurisdictions, it would not be appropriate. We feel the \nlanguage would allow for that flexibility. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nSection 1, subsection 1, at the top of page 3 states “but the threat is not \nimminent in the time it would take to obtain a warrant.” I interpret that to mean \nwe do not think the child is going to be harmed between now and the judge \nissuing a warrant. Is that correct? \n \nMS. OKUMA: \nIn a variety of cases, you have to get a warrant unless there is an exigency and \nthe child would be at risk of harm in the time it would take to get a warrant. We \nhave left the language as is in that respect because in some jurisdictions a \nwarrant can be obtained very quickly based on the technology they have. In \nother jurisdictions, it can take a bit longer to obtain a warrant. While the case \nlaw has been around, the process is still somewhat in its infancy as compared \nto warrants that are obtained in the criminal realm. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWould this language prohibit placing a child in protective custody if they are in \nimmediate jeopardy? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 22, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nMS. OKUMA: \nCorrect. We have many circumstances where an exigency exists and the child is \nin immediate danger and placed in protective custody.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI:  \nIn that circumstance, do they get the warrant after the child has been placed in \nprotective custody, or is the warrant mute at that point? \n \nMS. OKUMA: \nIf  there  is  an  exigency,  and  the  child  is  immediately  placed  into  protective \ncustody, there is no subsequent warrant. Whether there is a warrant or not, a \nhearing must be held within 72 hours, usually in less time than that, and a \nhearing notice is sent to the parents. They are provided counsel, and in most \ncases, it is before the court with a notice hearing. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nWe have a number of children who are in unsafe conditions because of sex \ntrafficking. Would that fall under this, or is this only for children who are in \nfamilial situations? \n \nMS. OKUMA: \nThis would not apply to a child who is a victim of sex trafficking unless the \nperson who is responsible for that child is a parent or other caregiver. There are \ncircumstances under NRS 432B that come within that, but other circumstances \nthat do not. Chapter 432B only deals with children at risk of abuse or neglect \nby a parent or other person responsible for their welfare that has a specific \ndefinition. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIf there is a child or parent who knows the child is going to be removed from \ntheir home and placed in foster care, and knows they have three or four days \nbefore  this  happens,  the  child  could  run  away  or  the  entire  family  could \ndisappear. How do you handle that situation? \n \nMS. OKUMA: \nThose circumstances do happen but are rare as it relates to the circumstance of \na warrant. Jurisdictions are obtaining warrants and have been for several years; \nhowever, we did not have a mechanism within the statute. Once the warrant is \nobtained by the social worker, they attempt to execute it quickly. Sometimes, \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 22, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nbetween  the  time  of  obtaining  a  warrant  and  executing  it,  the  family  does \ndisappear  and they  use all of their resources to try to locate the family to \nexecute the warrant. In those cases, or the exigent circumstance, there is no \nnotice given to the child before the social worker arrives. The same with the \nparents;  the  case  social  worker  or  law  enforcement  generally  provides  the \nwarrant and places the child in protective custody at the time the warrant is \nserved.  \n \nMR. JACKSON: \nThe Children’s Advocacy Alliance supports A.B. 426. This bill is essential to the \nprotection of children. \n \nALEXIS TUCEY (Deputy Administrator, Community Services, Division of Child and \nFamily Services, Department of Health and Human Services): \nThe Division of Child and Family Services is neutral on A.B. 426. \n \nNANCY SAITTA: \nI support A.B. 426. This is a bill that comes with significant support. It is an \nomnibus  bill  that  allows  for  clarification,  updating  and  modernizing  of  our \nstatutory scheme that will make the safety of children and families, and the \nefforts of our judicial officers and other stakeholders, more appropriate to serve \nthe children who need our assistance. This is a bill for which great gratitude is \nrequired. This will allow children and families the protection of a warrant in the \nmovement from and between multiple families and foster care placement in a \nway that protects their dignity.  \n \nThis bill can and will change the latitude or trajectory of our NRS 432B children \nand families and will make a difference for Nevada. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWho will be proposing the amendment that was mentioned? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will address that in the closing of the hearing. I would urge the sponsors to be \nin communication with the Committee between now and any scheduled work \nsession on this bill. If there is an amendment, please let us know so it can be \nreviewed before the work session. \n \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 426 and open it up for public testimony. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 22, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nVALERIE FRISKEY: \nI  am  a  resident  of  Assembly  District  No.  39  and  a  retired  teacher  from \nLyon County. I am active in the Nevada State Education Association and here to \nencourage you to consider the need for all education employees across the \nState to have access to quality affordable health care upon retirement. Our \nmembers are facing escalating costs of health care and prescriptions. Nevada is \na Windfall Elimination Provision, Government Pension Offset State, and many of \nour retired members will not have access to affordable health care because they \nwill not or do not qualify for Social Security and/or Medicare.  \n \nAs my colleagues retire, they incur insurance costs from $800 to $1,000 or \nmore per month after spending their entire careers as public school employees. \nWe  are  aware  of  and  understand  the  State  is  facing  serious  budgetary \nconstraints this year. We are asking the Legislators to fund steady retiree health \ncare for education employees. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nI will reopen the hearing on A.B. 426 for further support testimony. \n \nKENDRA BERTSCHY (Public Defender's Office, Washoe County): \nThe  Public  Defender’s  Office  supports  A.B. 426.  The  proposed  amendment \n(Exhibit  G),  is  to  clarify  language  changes  in  section  4,  subsection  1, \nparagraph (a) where it states “If the person responsible for the child’s welfare,” \nthe  individual  allowed  to  consent  for  the  child  to  be  placed  into  protective \ncustody, is changed to “the parent or legal guardian.” \n \nThis amendment, Exhibit G, is necessary because it clarifies who can consent to \nprotective custody and complies with the constitution. It is the agreed upon \nlanguage the stakeholders discussed during the negotiations for this bill. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nFor clarification; section 4, subsection 1, paragraph (a) is the language change \nof “the parent or legal guardian,” correct? \n \nMS. BERTSCHY: \nYes. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWould the sponsors of the bill consider this a friendly amendment? \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 22, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nMS. CARR: \nThe amendment is language that was originally proposed in Bill Draft Request \n(BDR) 38-516. There was an oversight in the transition from the BDR to the \nactual bill. Our team’s unanimous consent still exists on that amendment. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRemainder of page intentionally left blank; signature page to follow.   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nApril 22, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 426.

I will open the hearing on Senate Bill 61 \n(1st Reprint).  \n \nSenate  Bill  61  (1st  Reprint):    Revises  provisions  governing  the  program  for  the \noperation of vending facilities by licensees who are blind. (BDR 38-320) \n \nChristopher  Sewell,  Chief  Operating  Officer,  Legislative  Liaison,  Department  of \nEmployment, Training and Rehabilitation: \nI am here to assist in presenting Senate Bill 61 (1st Reprint) to the Committee.  The bill's \ndetails will be introduced by Chris Mazza, Chief Enterprise Officer in the Rehabilitation \nDivision.   With your permission, Madam Chair, I would like to turn the presentation over to \nMr. Mazza at this time. \n \nChris  Mazza,  Chief  Enterprise  Officer,  Blind  Business  Enterprise  of  Nevada, \nRehabilitation  Division,  Department  of  Employment,  Training  and \nRehabilitation: \n[Chris Mazza presented written testimony, Exhibit C].  As Chris Sewell said, I serve as the \nChief Enterprise Officer for the Blind Business Enterprise of Nevada, or BEN, Program for \nthe  Department  of  Employment,  Training  and  Rehabilitation's  (DETR)  Rehabilitation \nDivision.  I am here to present S.B. 61 (R1), which proposes changes to Nevada Revised \nStatutes (NRS) Chapter 426, the statutes related to the Blind Business Enterprise of Nevada \n(BEN)  Program.    Briefly,  the  BEN  Program  provides  entrepreneurial  opportunities  for \nindividuals who are blind to own and operate vending facilities in public buildings and \nproperties.  These vending facilities may include vending machines, cafes, cafeterias, cart \nservices, micro markets and gift and sundry shops. \n \nThe Program was established with passage of the Randolph-Sheppard Vending Stand Act in \n1936 which gave priority of right to blind licensees in federal buildings and properties.  \nStates across the nation then created state statutes, often called the mini-Randolph-Sheppard \nAct, mirroring the federal law within state law.  In fact, Nevada statutes have existed for \nmore than 60 years.  The state statutes provide the priority of right for blind licensees in state, \nlocal,  and  municipal  buildings  and  properties.    These  programs  exist  because  blind \nindividuals are employed at a rate of 52.3 percent as compared to 78.2 percent for those \nwithout a disability.  Blind individuals are in poverty at a rate of nearly 30 percent. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 3, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nIn Nevada, our blind licensees own and operate over 400 vending machines at 29 sites \nstatewide.  During typical times, they employ over 100 Nevadans.  Currently, due to the \npandemic, they are about half that number.  Some sites you might recognize include the \nsnack bars at many Department of Motor Vehicles locations, the Hoover Dam café and \nmercantile, and the Caucus Deli at the Legislative Building in Carson City.   \n \nWith the proposed changes within S.B. 61 (R1) we hope to:  (1) provide clarity to the law's \nintent; (2) define terms and use them consistently throughout the statute; (3) align state law \nmore closely with the federal Randolph-Sheppard Act and federal regulations; and (4) add a \nnew section on training which is in section 2 of the bill. \n \nSection 3 is a rewrite of our dispute resolution process.  The prior process placed the DETR \ndirector as the decision maker in disputes and even potentially involved the Governor.  This \nnew section provides for a more formal, uniform, and objective means to settle disputes \nbetween the Bureau of Services to Persons Who Are Blind or Visually Impaired within \nDETR  and  any  public  entity  partner  through  the  state's  Hearings  Division  within  the \nDepartment  of  Administration.    The  Department  of  Employment,  Training  and \nRehabilitation's administrator has spoken with the senior appeals officer within the Hearings \nDivision and has their support for this addition to our statutes. \n \nIn section 6, we have added several new definitions.  We think it is important to clarify these \nterms  and  thus  clarify  the  intent  of  the  program.    I  want  to  specifically  point  out  the \ndefinitions in subsections 4, 5, and 6.  Subsection 4 is the definition for \"public building or \nproperty.\"  We wanted to clarify the intent of the priority of right of our blind licensees.  To \ndo so, we included \"public entity\" as defined in subsection 5; we modeled our definition for \npublic entity after NRS 286.070 which defines a public employer.  Subsection 4 also includes \nexceptions for those meeting the definition but who would be exempt from participating in \nthe BEN Program.  Two new exceptions were added with the amendments.  The first is for \nan airport authority operating in this state and a department of aviation which is operated by \na political subdivision of the state.  The second exception is due to the fact that we are seeing \nnew public-private partnerships, especially in and around Las Vegas.  Based upon some \nconcerns that were raised by public entities, we added this exception for any public building \nor property used for live entertainment purposes as defined in NRS 368A.090.  Section 6, \nsubsection 6, defines \"vending facility.\"  This new definition is taken directly from the \nfederal regulations 34 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) § 395.1(x) and was done so to add \nclarity.  \n \nSection 7 includes new language to further explain the meaning of licensees' priority of right \nincluding the right of first refusal in subsection 1(a).  Due to concerns raised by some public \nentities, the amendment in section 7, subsection 2, paragraph (b), added further clarifying \nlanguage related to waivers stating waivers shall \"set forth the conditions under which the \nwaiver may be revoked or modified.\"  A concern was raised about section 7, subsection 1, \nparagraph (a), which states that if a public entity has an agreement in place for which the \nBureau notifies it that it intends to exercise its priority of right, that agreement is null.  \nHowever, it is not our intention to retroactively break contracts between public entities and \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 3, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \ntheir vendors.  The amendments included limiting this ability to the period after passage of \nS.B. 61 (R1), if approved, and not retroactively. \n \nSenate Bill 61 (1st Reprint), as amended, proposes to change the notification period in \nsection 8 from 30 days to 60 days.  This was a compromise with other public entities from \nour originally proposed 90 days.  A 60-day notification period is the same notification period \nrequired in 34 CFR § 395.31.   \n \nSection  11,  NRS  426.670,  is  a  heavy  section  of  law  that  contains  details  of  surveys, \nestablishing vending facilities, the Bureau's ability to create regulations, and costs that shall \nor shall not be paid by blind licensees.  Subsection 1, paragraph (a), details the survey \nprocess.  The Bureau would conduct a survey of the potential site to determine if it might be \na viable site for a blind licensee.  If so, subsection 2 details the necessity for cooperation \nfrom the public entity to establish the vending facility.  Amendments to S.B. 61 (R1) address \na concern that was raised that the Bureau could insist on the vending facility whether the \npublic entity wanted it or not.  The amendments include that the public entity shall cooperate \nwith the Bureau to discuss options for a vending facility and, if an agreement is reached, shall \ncooperate with the Bureau to establish one or more vending facilities. \n \nSenate Bill 61 (1st Reprint) adds more detail to our ability to create regulations in section 11, \nsubsection 4.  The added language is taken directly from the requirements in the federal \nregulations.  Subsection 5 distinguishes costs that shall be paid by licensees and those that \nshall not.  These are taken from the Randolph-Sheppard Act which puts constraints on what \nmay be paid out by the licensees' set-aside funds.  In subsection 6, we added the ability to \npay incentives in the rare instance that it might be appropriate.  This is the only payment, \noutside  of  increased  utility  costs,  where  we  may  have  flexibility.    The  term  has  been \nborrowed from the state of Tennessee's mini-Randolph-Sheppard Act where it is in use in \ntheir agreements to run commissaries in county jails. \n \nSection  12  adds  a  description  of  management  services  in  subsection  2,  paragraph  (c), \nsubparagraph (3), which are allowable to be paid out of the set-aside or \"enterprise\" account.  \nThis is the federal description.  The change in subsection 5(b) regarding the portion each \nlicensee would receive if the program was liquidated was determined and agreed to by the \nNevada Committee of Vendors Who Are Blind.   \n \nSection 13 has added language that ensures the continuity of services in a vending facility \nshould the blind licensee have a period of disability or permanent disability.  It outlines what \nwould occur, including that the Bureau would run the site until a licensee was able to return, \nup to six months. \n \nLastly, I would like to call your attention to section 19.  Nevada Revised Statutes 426.715 is \nthe penalty section of the law.  A concern was raised that according to this section, public \nemployees could be guilty of a misdemeanor for ordering a sandwich from a sandwich shop \nor a pizza from a pizzeria, and that the delivery drivers of that sandwich or pizza could also \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 3, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nbe guilty of a misdemeanor.  This is not our intent; therefore, amendments in this section are \nto alleviate this concern.  \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAt this time, we do have some questions from Committee members. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI have a question regarding section 7, subsection 1, paragraph (a).  It mentions that the \nBureau has the right of first refusal for any operation of any vending facility in any public \nbuilding or property.  Throughout the state of Nevada there are many public locations in rural \nand in urban areas, so before someone can put a vending machine in, will all applications \nhave to go through your office? \n \nChris Mazza: \nYes, that would be the case.  If you want to put in a vending machine in a public entity \nbuilding, you would first come through our office.   \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nWhen I read this, it says public entity or any entity that receives public funding.  Do you have \nthe capacity to do that?  That could be hundreds of building locations.  What would be the \ndelay in that process?  How long does it take and how competitive is it?  Do you get to take \nwhatever percentage of profit, and nothing goes back to the entity where the building is, \nwhere the vending is?  I need some clarity on all of that. \n \nChris Mazza: \nIf you are referring specifically to rural areas and the capacity to operate one vending \nmachine in a rural community, we would not have the capacity to do that.  In fact, these \nbusinesses, or these buildings that have the businesses in them, would have to be deemed \na viable business.  We would first do a survey to make sure that business is in fact viable for \na blind licensee to operate that business.  If it is not viable, we could potentially provide \na waiver.  We do that in the rural communities where there are two, three, or four vending \nmachines.  That certainly is not a viable business, so we would waive that specific location \nfor the blind licensee.  Then that public entity would be able to go out on their own and \nprovide the services they need. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI was wondering about the turnaround time for the applications now when someone wants to \nput a vending machine in a public building.  From my reading of the bill, if a building or any \nentity accepts public funds, even if it is not technically a public building, would you have \nfirst right of refusal if someone wanted to put a vending machine in? \n \nChris Mazza: \nIf I am understanding your question correctly, if a public entity is in a private building, then, \nno.  We would not have the ability to put a vending machine in it.  If a public entity were to \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 3, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nlease or rent space from a private building and wanted a vending machine in their specific \narea, then, yes, we would be able to put a vending machine in that specific area.   \n \nAs far as turnaround times, again, depending upon the viability of the location, we work with \nnot only blind licensees but third-party contractors.  They can turn around these facilities in \na matter of days, if not weeks, depending on the location in Nevada. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nIs this department of the blind the only ones that have this?  There are no other special needs, \nno other disability entities or peoples, who would have a business like this.  Is the blind \nbusiness entity the only one that gets a leg up like this in a business opportunity in our state \nor are there other opportunities? \n \nChris Mazza: \nThis is specific to people who are blind and visually impaired.  It was established by the \nRandolph-Sheppard Act, a federal act, started in 1936.  This Act specifically refers to people \nwho are blind and visually impaired. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any other questions from Committee members?   \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nDo you have any information about the diversity in your licensees?  You said you had \n400 vending machine locations throughout the state.  That does not mean 400 different \nvendors but vendors who have 400 locations. \n \nChris Mazza: \nOur  program  oversees  400  vending  machines  throughout  the  state.    You  are  correct.  \nThat does  not  mean  that  we  have  400  individual  licensees  running  those  400  vending \nmachines.  That program right now has ten licensed operators, two interim operators—people \non a path to obtaining their licenses—and two trainees, with the potential for more trainees \ndown the road.  Currently we have 14 blind individuals in the program with the capability of \nrunning a business. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nDo you have information about the diversity in your program, both ethnicity and women? \n \nChris Mazza: \nI will have to get back to you on the ethnic background of our licensees; however, I can tell \nyou we currently have six males and four females who are licensed operators.  I do not have \nthe specifics on their ethnic backgrounds, but they vary quite a bit. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nThis program is not just vending machines, correct?  You also have hot food and other \nthings, so of the 14 licensees, that includes both vending machines and food service. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 3, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nChris Mazza: \nThat is correct. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nIf you could please provide some additional information on the diversity of your pool, that \nwould be great. \n \nChris Mazza: \nAbsolutely. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIf you can provide that to our Committee staff, they will be able to distribute it to all the \nmembers for their review. \n \nYou initially said there were 400 vending machines.  Is that correct? \n \nChris Mazza: \nWe  have  400  individual  vending  machines  associated  with  the  program.    Those  are \nindividual vending machines. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nOf those 400 vending machines, are those 400 separate individuals or are they under those \n14 individuals you mentioned? \n \nChris Mazza: \nThose  are  not  400  individual  businesses,  but  a  vending  route  may  have  in  excess  of \n100 machines or 50 machines depending on the number of machines that would make a site \nviable.  We do not have 400 people; we have 14 people running the businesses of those \n400 vending machines. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIs there any limitation on how many vending machines licensees may have under the one \nbusiness license? \n \nChris Mazza: \nThere is no limit. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nMy question is related to your description of the bill, the exemptions from the BEN Program \nof live performance venues.  Can you discuss the need for that?  It was a vague description, \nand I would like a little more information about the purpose. \n \nChris Mazza: \nAt our initial proposal of this bill, we had several discussions with the City of Henderson.  \nThe City of Henderson has entered into some entertainment facilities like the arena, which is \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 3, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \ngoing to be the practice facility for the Henderson Silver Knights.  Because it does present \na live entertainment venue, we felt it proper to include that in the exemption. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nI believe I missed a little of the rationale.  It is the City of Henderson specifically, but it \nwould have an impact on every live public venue in the state, right?  In Reno, we have \na couple of event centers, so they would no longer be obligated under BEN to be surveyed, \nbut can you give me a little more on why? \n \nChris Mazza: \nThose  facilities  are  a  challenge  for  blind  operators  based  on  the  sales  volume  and \ninconsistency.  They could be busy a few days here and a few days there.  If that is the sole \nbusiness and it is only occasional, it tends to not be a viable site. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nThat makes more sense to have it open to caterers or special event venue folks rather than \nhaving it exclusively go through the BEN process for assessment every time they have \na large event. \n \nAssemblyman Hafen: \nWe have stated there were 14 vendors.  Of  these 14 vendors, how  many of them are \ncurrently blind? \n \nChris Mazza: \nThey are all blind. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there other questions from Committee members?  [There were none.]  I am going to \nbegin  testimony  in  support,  opposition,  and  neutral  on  S.B.  61  (R1),  beginning  with \ntestimony in support.   \n \nArielle Edwards, Government Affairs Specialist, City of North Las Vegas: \nWe are in support of this measure and would like to thank DETR for working with the cities \nand counties on the amendment language.  Thank you for your time and consideration. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWith no one else in support, I will go to opposition to S.B. 61 (R1). \n \nSteven Cohen, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \nThis is an issue of great personal importance to me as the nephew of an aunt with a lifelong \nvisual disability who lives in a different state.  In light of the impact of the pandemic, until \nwe see public facilities return to sustainable capacity levels where folks would be able to \nserve customers, I just cannot get there at this time, but completely support the concept in \nfuture sessions. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 3, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nLet us go to our next caller in opposition.  [There was no one.]  I will open up testimony in \nneutral to S.B. 61 (R1). \n \nMichael Hillerby, representing City of Sparks: \nWe would like to thank DETR and the folks at the agency who testified today and worked \nwith us on some concerns about local buildings.  We wanted to be sure that our elected \nofficials in our communities have an appropriate level of involvement in those decisions.  \nThey worked very well with us, and that language is included in sections 7 and 11, and also \nin the written testimony the agency provided with some background.  Again, we want to \nthank them for working closely with us and arriving at a good version of the bill. \n \nDavid Cherry, Government Affairs Manager, City of Henderson: \nI want to begin by thanking Administrator Shelley Hendren and her very capable team for \nworking with us to address our concerns with Senate Bill 61 as introduced.  The reprint being \nconsidered today contains substantial changes that resulted from these discussions with local \ngovernments that have allowed us to move to a neutral position.  The City of Henderson \nalready offers blind entrepreneurs who are part of the BEN Program business opportunities at \nmultiple city facilities, and we recognize the benefits of this program for those it serves.  \nImportantly, the reprint restores the consent-based framework now in current statute when it \ncomes to determining if vending services are needed, and if so, what type.  Finally, the City \nappreciates S.R. 61 (R1)'s section 6 language that grants an exception from NRS Chapter 426 \nrequirements for leases granted to an operator for live entertainment purposes, which reflect \nan increasingly common practice for many covered entities.  Again, thank you for the \nopportunity to present this testimony.  \n \nJoanna Jacob, Government Affairs Manager, Clark County: \nWe  worked  with  DETR  on  this  bill  in  the  Senate  on  behalf  of  all  of  Clark  County's \ndepartments and specifically on behalf of the Clark County Department of Aviation that \noperates McCarran Airport.  The Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation \nworked with us to address all of our concerns.  We were opposed in the Senate, but are \nneutral with the amendments and with the testimony today.  We want to thank Administrator \nHendren and her team for working with us.  Clark County has extended our partnership with \nthe DETR BEN Program, and we are hoping to find additional ways to partner with them \nwhere appropriate and feasible.  We are neutral on the measure as proposed today. \n \nDavid Dazlich, Director, Government Affairs, Vegas Chamber: \nI would like to echo the sentiments from my colleagues with the cities and I would like to \nthank Administrator Hendren for working to address our concerns.  I would like to note that \nwe have moved to neutral from our original opposition, thanks to the amendments made to \nS.B. 61 (R1). \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWith no more callers in neutral, I will turn this back over for closing remarks. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 3, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nChristopher Sewell: \nWe would like to thank you and the Committee for giving us this opportunity to present this \nvery good bill for the blind enterprise businesses throughout our state.  We look forward to \nits passage and signature by the Governor.  I want to thank Mr. Mazza.  He was put in this \nposition a few days ago and this is the first time he has ever testified before the Legislature.  \nI think he did a great job, so, Chris, thank you.  I would also like to again thank the \nCommittee and its staff for their assistance. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWith that, I will close the bill hearing on S.B. 61 (R1).  We will now open the hearing on \nSenate Bill 275 (1st Reprint).  There was a new proposed amendment just uploaded to the \nNevada Electronic Legislative Information System [Exhibit D].  It probably was also emailed \nto Committee members.  I have been told by Senator Harris that it is a friendly amendment, \nand the presentation today will be based on that friendly amendment. \n \nSenate Bill 275 (1st Reprint):  Revises provisions relating to communicable diseases. \n(BDR 40-220) \n \nSenator Dallas Harris, Senate District No. 11: \nIt is my honor to present to you Senate Bill 275 (1st Reprint).  As Chair Nguyen noted, \nJennifer Howell is here to answer questions about the amendment submitted by the health \ndistricts [Exhibit D].  Senate Bill 275 (1st Reprint) will modernize Nevada's laws on human \nimmunodeficiency virus, or HIV, by treating HIV in the same way as Nevada treats all other \ncommunicable  diseases.    In  doing  so,  S.B.  275  (R1)  will  remove  from  Nevada  statute \ndiscriminatory laws that unfairly target people because of their HIV status.  These laws were \nnot  rooted  in  science,  but  in  fear,  and  have  had  significant  negative  public  health \nconsequences for Nevada for decades.  Senate Bill 275 (1st Reprint) is the culmination of \nmany years of thoughtful discussion and hard work led by former Senator David Parks.  \nI have asked him to join me to provide you with a historical review of how we got to this \nimportant hearing today.   \n \nDavid Parks, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \nDuring the 80th Session of the Legislature, I was successful in getting passed Senate Bill 284 \nof the 80th Session, which created a task force to examine and make recommendations for \nthe revision of existing statutes related to the criminalization of HIV and AIDS.  These \nupdated statutes taken under review grew out of recommendations from an advisory task \nforce created by former Governor Richard Bryan some 35 years ago in 1986.  For more than \n30 years since the task force was in place, I was a member of that task force.  In the early \nyears of the HIV infection and the AIDS epidemic, states including Nevada implemented \nHIV-specific criminal exposure laws.  These laws imposed criminal penalties on people \nliving with HIV who knew their HIV status and who potentially exposed others to HIV.    \n \nIn 1990, the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act provided states \nwith funding for HIV and AIDS treatment and care and required every state receiving federal \nfunds to certify that its criminal laws were adequate to prosecute any HIV-infected individual \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 3, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nwho knowingly exposed another person to HIV.  In our legal system, criminalization of \npotential HIV exposure is largely a matter of state law and not federal legislation.  An \nanalysis by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of \nJustice found that at least 67 laws had been enacted in 33 states exclusively focused on \npersons living with HIV.  The majority of these laws were passed before antiretroviral \ntherapies were developed that reduced the HIV transmission risk to zero.  Currently, it is \npossible to be HIV-positive and to have no detectable presence of the virus.   \n \nAs a person who helped develop Nevada's HIV/AIDS statutes and regulations in the late \n1980s and middle 1990s, this is an issue that I have personally wrestled with the last four \nlegislative sessions.  Over the years, we found that criminalization laws do not support \nevidence-based public health practices reaching those who are at higher risk for HIV and \nAIDS.  The data indicates that people who are at high risk for HIV exposure are deterred \nfrom  testing  which  facilitates  HIV  care  and  prevention  methods  that  would  stop  the \ntransmission of HIV.  Fear of being charged with life-altering felony charges and being \nprosecuted for living with HIV and not disclosing their status deters both testing and seeking \nout care.   \n \nWith the passage of S.B. 284 of the 80th Session, a coalition of social service and health care \nprofessionals across the state and the nation worked diligently to address this issue and \ndevelop recommendations for consideration by our Legislature in S.B. 275 (R1).  Before \nI conclude my testimony, I want to thank all those individuals and organizations who came \nforward to work on the S.B. 284 of the 80th Session task force and the development of \nS.B. 275 (R1).  The work that was accomplished was beyond my wildest expectations.  I also \nwant to thank Senator Harris for the introduction of S.B. 275 (R1).  It is long past time for \nNevada to modernize its HIV laws. \n \nSenator Harris: \nNevada's current laws regarding HIV are outdated, ineffective, and discriminatory.  Currently \nin Nevada, it is a class B felony for a person living with HIV who knows their status to \nintentionally engage in behavior that could transmit the virus to someone else, regardless of \ntransmission risk or intent to transmit the virus.  Further, in 1993, the Nevada Legislature \npassed Senate Bill 514 of the 67th Session, which prohibits certain conduct through which \nHIV can be transmitted after testing positive for the disease.  The consequence for those \nfound criminally liable could be a prison sentence of up to 20 years and/or a fine up to \n$10,000.  In Nevada, individuals can be convicted of HIV transmission even when there is no \nintent to transmit HIV and no risk of transmitting HIV.  Our laws have not kept up with \nscience.  In this modern world, we know how to eliminate the risk of transmission through \ntreatment of individuals living with HIV.  Our laws criminalize behavior that cannot transmit \nthe virus.  Further, our laws are ineffective and counterproductive to our goals associated \nwith ensuring Nevada's public health and welfare.  No other disease is included in Nevada's \ncriminal code.  That is because criminalizing sickness forces sick people into the shadows \nand discourages sick Nevadans from getting tested for the disease for fear of punishment.  \nNot only do our laws fail to prevent the spread of HIV, they are an obstacle to ending the \nHIV epidemic.  \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 3, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nI quickly want to walk through what the bill does.  Senate Bill 275 (1st Reprint) makes \nintentional conduct that may transmit HIV a misdemeanor instead of a felony and moves the \nstatute from the penal code to the public health code.  In doing so, this would align the state's \ntreatment of HIV with that of other communicable diseases.  Senate Bill 275 (1st Reprint) \nalso amends outdated laws that criminalize behavior such as biting and spitting.  Modern \nscience has taught us that you cannot transmit HIV through saliva, yet Nevada law subjects \nsomeone with HIV to extra punishment for such behavior simply because they have HIV.  \nLet me be clear:  such behavior is assault and battery and should be treated as such.  That will \nnot change under S.B. 275 (R1).  Senate Bill 275 (1st Reprint) also repeals the Nevada law \nthat makes it a felony for people living with HIV to engage in sex work.  This does not \nchange Nevada law that makes illegal sex work a misdemeanor under Nevada law. \n \nIf we have learned anything from the past year, it is that we know testing, transparency, and \ntreatment are essential to addressing a public health crisis.  Individuals living with HIV \nshould not live in fear of criminal penalties simply because they have contracted HIV.  \nSenate  Bill  275  (1st  Reprint),  by  modernizing  Nevada's  HIV  laws,  will  enable  us,  the \nNevadan family, to proactively tackle and, hopefully, bring to an end the HIV public health \ncrisis in Nevada. \n \nAndré Wade, State Director, Silver State Equality: \n[André Wade supplied additional information Exhibit E, Exhibit F, and a letter of support, \nExhibit  G].    Silver  State  Equality  is  a  Nevada-based,  statewide  LGBTQ  civil  rights \norganization which brings the voices of LGBTQ+ people and our allies to institutions of \npower in Nevada and across the United States, striving to create a world that is healthy, just, \nand fully equal for all LGBTQ+ people.  Also, I am chair of the Governor's Advisory Task \nForce on HIV Exposure Modernization, which was tasked with reporting our findings and \nmaking recommendations which you should have received.  Today, I am speaking to you on \nbehalf of Silver State Equality. \n \nThis bill has been many years in the making because for decades there have been outdated, \nineffective, and discriminatory laws in Nevada that do more harm than any good that could \ncome of them.  Just note that there are about nine other states working on HIV modernization \nthis year across the nation.  While efforts are underway to end the HIV epidemic by, in part, \ndeveloping statewide and local plans to address people getting tested to know their status, \ngetting people in care and staying in care, these plans also include modernizing laws that \ncriminalize otherwise legal behavior or increase penalties for criminal behaviors based on \na person's HIV status.  These laws stigmatize people living with HIV and go against the very \npublic health efforts to end the HIV epidemic that have been put in place by specifically \ncalling out HIV in the law while other communicable diseases are not.  Of course, these laws \ndisproportionately affect the Black community. \n \nThe issue at hand is to treat HIV like any other communicable disease and not require \na sentence enhancement.  This effort is supported by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the American Medical Association, and the \nU.S. Office of Infectious Disease and HIV/AIDS Policy.  We have submitted letters that \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 3, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \ninclude  about  40  individuals,  including  those  who  are  Spanish-language  speakers,  and \n27 organizations across Nevada [Exhibit H and Exhibit I].  HIV is a public health issue, not \na criminal one, and our laws should reflect that.  Thank you in advance for your support for \nthis very important piece of legislation. \n \nSenator Harris: \nWe have one more presenter, Mr. Sears, who can speak about some of the Nevada-specific \nstudies he has conducted. \n \nBrad Sears, Associate Dean, Public Interest Law, University of California, Los Angeles \nSchool of Law: \nIt was my pleasure to do a study at University of California, Los Angeles similar to other \nstudies to measure the impact that Nevada's criminal HIV laws have had on people.  I am \ngoing to share my screen right now so you can see some of the results [Brad Sears presented \na PowerPoint, Exhibit J, and additional information, Exhibit K and Exhibit L].  I would like \nto  thank  the  Department  of  Public  Safety's  Records,  Communications  and  Compliance \nDivision.    They  responded  to  our  records  requests  multiple  times  and  were  extremely \ncooperative in helping us by not only providing the data but helping us understand it. \n \nI want to highlight a few things we learned, and I will start by saying that these things are \nconsistent with the four other states for which we have done similar analyses.  The first \nfinding is, you might think that these laws were passed a long time ago and enforced a long \ntime ago and now they are enforced less.  That is not the case.  This is not a solution in \nsearch of a problem.  People are still being arrested and charged with these laws.  About \n63 percent of the arrests in the data have happened since 2013, and you can see three of the \nfive biggest years for arrests since these laws were first passed have happened since 2013 \n[page  3,  Exhibit  J].    It  is  an  ongoing  issue  impacting  Nevadans.    Second,  and  again, \nconsistent with the other four states we looked at, while the initial focus of this law might \nhave been on other types of conduct, they are really used now primarily to charge people \nwho are also charged with sex work.  Unlike sex work, they carry felonies instead of \nmisdemeanors and, as Senator Harris said, much higher sentences.  They increase the penalty \nfor people suspected of doing sex work, so you can see that 61 percent of the charges are \nagainst sex workers [page 4]. \n \nThat also means that, unlike probably what was in people's minds in the 1980s and 1990s, \nthese crimes are not being charged just against men, but women, and you can see that about \na third of the charges are against women [page 5].  That corresponds with the focus of the \ncharges against sex workers.  That is double the percentage of the HIV-positive population in \nNevada for women.  There is one other demographic that, for me, really opens up the picture \nof whom these laws are impacting.  The age range of these folks is from 17 to 68.  When you \ntake that age range and you think about sex workers, you also have to think about a number \nof young girls, women, who may be trafficked.  If you are in your 60s doing sex work, it may \nbe for survival reasons.  These are felonies and huge penalties impacting already vulnerable \npopulations that we want to engage with public health. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 3, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nThe  other  thing  that  has  been  consistent  across  every  state  we  have  looked  at  is  that \nthese laws disproportionately impact people of color—in particular Black people [page 6, \nExhibit J].  A way to sum up this chart is, if you have a disease like HIV—which we know \ndisproportionately  impacts  Black  people—and  we  have  a  criminal  justice  system  that \ndisproportionately impacts Black people, and you make a crime about the disease, this is the \nonly thing that is going to result.  While Black people make up 10 percent of the state's \npopulation roughly, they make up about 46 percent of convictions for HIV crimes. \n \nSomething else we have seen in the other states we have looked at is that enforcement is not \nuniversal across the state [page 7].  It is concentrated in a handful of places.  In Nevada, \nthis comes down to three counties, with almost 80 percent of the arrests not only being in \nClark County or Las Vegas, but by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.  So it is, \nin a way, a statewide law that impacts all people with HIV and prevention efforts but has a \nvery localized enforcement.   \n \nThe final thing to point out is, when you think about what is being charged, are these people \nintending to transmit the virus?  Have they actually transmitted the virus?  Have they even \nengaged in conduct that transmits the virus?  Well, none of these folks were charged with the \nintent  to  transmit  the  virus.    None  of  these  arrests  or  convictions  actually  involved \ntransmission of the virus.  Most of the arrests are for conduct that does not have anything to \ndo with transmitting the virus.  Most sex workers are arrested or charged with conduct that \nthey do on the street—communication on the street, communication that happens online, or \nby sting operations of law enforcement.  That does not cover conduct that can be transmitted \nby HIV.  The surprising, new thing about Nevada that I have not seen in the other four states \nwe looked at is that a third of all convictions are for attempt or conspiracy charges [page 8].  \nWhen you think about attempt to solicit or conspiracy to solicit, the conduct that usually \ncharges solicitation happens right at the attempt to do that.  This makes more sense when you \nconsider that 95 percent of people in the criminal justice system plead, but again, we are \ngetting more and more removed from conduct that can actually transmit the virus.  \n \nSenator Harris: \nThat concludes our presentation, Chair Nguyen.  I am more than happy to answer any \nquestions.  Jennifer Howell from Washoe County is here and can answer questions on the \namendment.  What you see before you is the result of a lot of work and collaboration to make \nsure we are putting our laws in a better, less discriminatory place while also ensuring that our \nhealth districts have the authority they need to clamp down on any infections that are \nspreading and keep the community safe.  It has been a long road, but, hopefully, with this last \namendment, we are there. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 3, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nYou indicated that we do not criminalize any other health condition someone might have, so \nwe do not have any corresponding laws for hepatitis, is that correct? \n \nSenator Harris: \nThat is correct.  We do not have a law that makes the intentional transmission of hepatitis \na felony. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe do not have the same thing for HPV [human papillomavirus] or syphilis or any other \nsexually transmitted diseases.  Is that correct?   \n \nSenator Harris: \nYes, that is correct. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWhen I first started practicing law, we saw these cases a lot, especially in the area of \nprostitution.  At the time, there was a mechanism that law enforcement would be able to look \nat the health records.  They were like a part of your criminal background check.  Would this \nlaw remove reporting of personal medical records to other agencies?  Would it eliminate \nthat? \n \nSenator Harris: \nI am not aware of us tinkering in that section at all.  As far as I am aware, it would not \nchange any information sharing currently happening. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo you know if any of your other presenters know how that information is provided?  \nIn previous cases I had, it was a situation where I would get a health record showing \nsomeone had a positive test for HIV or AIDS and that would be used to enhance the criminal \npenalty for a prostitution charge.   \n  \nSenator Harris: \nI do not know if Ms. Howell is aware of what the sharing agreements with law enforcement \ncurrently are.   \n \nJennifer Howell, Sexual Health Program Coordinator, Washoe County Health District: \nThe way we have done this in Washoe County is if we provided testing in conjunction with \nlaw enforcement during, for instance, a prostitution sting, then we would provide the test \nresults.  If we did not test during the same event, we would not provide that information and \nthey would have to seek that information through a court order.  That is the only time the \ninformation was readily available to law enforcement.  We do not provide the information \notherwise.  It is my understanding that getting rid of the enhanced charge for the prostitution-\nrelated section of this would eliminate that information sharing. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 3, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nYou mentioned it would reduce some of these charges that are currently felonies because of \nreducing this health status down to misdemeanors.  Is that consistent with every other person \nwho would commit the same crime? \n \nSenator Harris: \nYes.  We are removing the felony without explicitly calling out HIV because that defeats the \npurpose—placing it with other communicable diseases.  I believe science has shown there is \nno reason to single it out. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nAnd HIV is unlike any other communicable disease—yes or no? \n \nSenator Harris: \nI would say it is like other communicable diseases, and in so much as it is like other \ncommunicable diseases, of course they vary in treatment and cause, in transmission rates, but \nit does not vary any more than any other communicable disease would. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nI understand making it a misdemeanor by law, but my concern is that those individuals who \nknow they are positive, whether they are in the sex trade or not, can use their status as \na weapon against other people.  Because they got it, they want everyone they come into \ncontact with to get it.  Is that still a misdemeanor? \n \nSenator Harris: \nI would like to note that your uneasiness explains why we have to bring this bill.  There are \npeople who are living with all kinds of communicable diseases who could, for one reason or \nanother, choose to go out and attempt to weaponize that; HIV is not the only communicable \ndisease someone could intentionally transmit.  A perfect example is the coronavirus in \ntoday's world.  But the fear and stigma that have been put behind HIV over the last 30 years \nare what is leading to that uneasiness.  In the worst-case example, someone would have to \ndraw their blood and stick someone in their sleep without them knowing it, or when walking \nby them.  There are a whole slew of charges you could make to someone who engages in that \ntype of conduct, and you would be able to do that for some other type of communicable \ndisease—if there is someone intentionally trying to harm other people.  There is no reason we \nhave to call HIV out separately. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nSenator Parks, it is great to see you.  Thank you for continuing to be an advocate.  As we \nmade changes in the last session, I was supportive regarding the need to decriminalize HIV, \nand I think it is critical that we do so.  My concern is not the HIV component of this bill.  My \nconcern is it almost looks as though we are criminalizing all communicable diseases and not \nspelling out HIV.  Senator Harris, you mentioned the coronavirus.  That is a communicable \ndisease.  As board chair of the Lyon County health board and as the county health officer, we \nhave struggled with the coronavirus epidemic.  How do we handle folks we know have \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 3, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \ncoronavirus who want to attend an event?  We know they just tested positive, so could they \nor could they not go?  Where were we legally?  What could we do with that?  Having \nstruggled with that, we understand the mandate to quarantine.  My concern is with the bill.  \nSection 1 in the amended recommendation says, \"Treat any person or group of persons with \na communicable disease case and those exposed to a communicable disease . . .\" [page 6, \nExhibit D].   I understand the quarantine aspect of it from a public health point, but my \nconcern is \"treat\" the person.  What if the person does not want to be treated, wants the \ndisease to run its natural course?  Where are the individual rights to personal choice when it \ncomes to treatment? \n \nSenator Harris: \nLet me start with the language—the word \"treat.\"  We changed to the word \"treat\" from what \nwas previously \"disinfect,\" which is a little bit antiquated.  The existing law said we can \n\"disinfect\" someone.  We decided \"treat\"' was a much more appropriate term.  Also note that \nthis is what the county board of health \"may\" do.  There is no \"shall\" in section 1:  \"The \ncounty board of health may . . . .\"  If you note previously in existing law, it says \"isolate, \nquarantine and disinfect.\"  We had a discussion today—in order to protect personal liberties, \nyou need to isolate someone in certain circumstances; you may need to quarantine someone \nin  certain  circumstances;  and  then  we  need  the  ability  to  treat  people  in  certain \ncircumstances—so  that  we  do  not  have  folks  who  need  to  be  treated  under  the  same \nqualifications as someone who might need to be quarantined.  I will ask Jennifer Howell to \ntalk a bit about what happens when you want to treat someone and they tell you to pound \nsand. \n \nJennifer Howell: \nAs we interpret it, it is an individual right.  If someone does not want to engage in STD \ntreatment, HIV treatment, or treatment for any of the communicable diseases, that is their \nright, but they still may be subjected to quarantine or isolation based on that information as \nlong as they are in the incubation period or infectious period. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI just needed clarity that the person still had that right.  As a provider, when I counseled \na patient, I told them they had the right to refuse treatment, but then, you have to look at the \npublic health aspect of that.  I agree, these are questions that need some clarity.  I appreciate \nthe option in here to have a judicial review and pathway if you disagree.  As an observation, \nin my day, we used to have parties when we knew someone had a communicable disease.  \nWhen someone had chicken pox, everyone went to that house because all the kids needed to \nbe exposed to that disease.  Those days have certainly changed.  Thank you for bringing the \nbill forward, and Senator Parks, it is great to see you. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nIf a person, for instance with HIV, chose not to seek treatment but still carried on in their \nbehavior, you said there are other things that can be brought for that person.  Could you \nplease expand on that? \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 3, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nSenator Harris: \nIf you are infectious or you have a communicable disease, you are posing a threat to public \nhealth and you are going to get a warning from your public health district.  They are going to \nlet you know that your behavior is dangerous and ask that you not do it.  The second time \nyou do that, if you ignore that warning, that is where the misdemeanor comes in and that is \nwhat is in existing law, Nevada Revised Statutes 441A.180.  That is the current state of the \nlaw for every disease except HIV.  We would now be moving HIV under that process.  \nMs. Howell can talk about what happens, after you have a misdemeanor, if you are still \ncontinuing to engage in that behavior.  It is my understanding that they bring in the police to \nhelp enforce these types of situations. \n \nJennifer Howell: \nWhat happens is that our civil district attorney (DA) brings those charges forward and then \nwe work with law enforcement.  In my 20 years of working at the health district, I have not \nbeen aware of this happening, but that is what the mechanism would be, as it has been \nexplained to me.   \n \nTo the question about whether someone decides not to engage in their HIV treatment, that is \ntheir choice, and we have had people in the community who I have encountered who have \ndone that for various reasons.  It is their right to do so, but we want to give them all the \nexplanations as to why it would be beneficial to their health and to the health of other people.  \nIf they were to go to intentional transmission, then it goes to a warning and what Senator \nHarris was describing. \n \nSenator Harris: \nIt was very important that we maintain the health districts' ability to keep the public safe, so \nany rogue actors will continue to be treated as such. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nEspecially in southern Nevada, we are having outbreaks all the time of syphilis, gonorrhea, \nand other kinds of communicable diseases.  Mr. Wade and Mr. Sears spoke about how this \nlaw affects Black people more than anyone else.  Is there help available, because we are still \nseeing high rates of HIV in Black communities?  If we get rid of this charge, if people come \nto the health district and they need help, do we have resources available to treat them if they \nwant to be treated?  Even with COVID-19, the lack of access to health care is a real issue.  \nCan you speak to that so we can all have clarity?  Can you also speak to the rate of \ntransmission; are we seeing any of these diseases—syphilis, gonorrhea, HPV, anything—and \nwhat are they looking like in Black and other communities of color?  Is there help available?  \nWe do not want to just say to get rid of it and then we do not help people.  We need to make \nsure there is sufficient help. \n \nSenator Harris: \nThank you for the question.  I will use this as a chance to plug another one of my bills, \nSenate Bill 211, which is a bill that would require providers to offer HIV and traditional \nSTD testing in hopes of addressing what you hit on, which are embarrassing STD numbers in \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 3, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nthe state.  That bill, in conjunction with this bill, will do a lot to try to bring that down, but \nMs. Howell can talk about the treatment and what happens when someone comes in and \nrequests help. \n \nJennifer Howell: \nIf it is an index case, which is someone we just found to have an STD or HIV that is reported \nto us by a physician or provider or by our own testing, then we make contact with that person \nto  see  if  they  have  had  appropriate  treatment—because  some  providers  do  not  follow \nappropriate STD treatment guidelines—or if they are connected to HIV care or if they want \nto be.  If needed, Washoe County Health District does not have provisions for HIV care, but \nwe refer to our community providers, and there are a couple of private providers who do \nprovide that service.  We do warm handoffs and very active referrals.  We do not just give \nthem a phone number and tell them to go on their way, especially if it is someone living with \nHIV.  We make appointments with them at the time they are in our office as much as we can \nand make sure we have a good connection to care services.  For STDs, it is a little different.  \nWe will make sure they have appropriate treatment through their provider or that their \nprovider offers that treatment.  If they do not receive treatment, we will follow up with them \nto offer treatment through our clinic.   \n \nAs for the disproportionate impact by race, it definitely is there.  It is in Washoe County; it is \nin southern Nevada as well.  It is something we need to address by addressing a larger scale \nof health disparities and getting people access to services.  Having them feel comfortable \nwith those services is a huge part of that.  We definitely do not turn anyone away, and we \nfollow through on all the cases reported to us.  We just need to know that the person has \na positive test to be able to follow through with them, which is what Senate Bill 211 does.  \nWe work as hard as we can, as diligently as we can, to ensure that there are no gaps in \nservices if a person wants to seek those services.  We try to indulge any issues that come up \nwith a client to do so. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIf you can get any of the other information Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong mentioned \nregarding transmission rates for other communicable diseases, that would be wonderful.  \nJust give it to Committee staff who will distribute it.  Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson \nhas a question. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI have a question about the use of the DA's power if they needed to, and that you had not \nseen that used for 20 years.  Was that in response to the HIV statutes as we have them, or to \nall communicable diseases? \n \nJennifer Howell: \nI am more familiar with HIV.  I have worked in that program for 20 years, but in terms of \nother STDs or sexually transmitted infections, I have not seen that either.  Going beyond  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 3, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nthose to the broad list of communicable diseases that are listed in Nevada Administrative \nCode (NAC) Chapter 441A, I have not heard of it, but I can see if we have done that and get \nthat information back to you.  I have not heard that we have had to enforce that. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nIt seems to me that where more of these conversations have played out has concerned \ntuberculosis and when there is someone who is active and positive.  Sometimes it can be \ndifficult to get their consent if they are someone who tends to be noncompliant or has \nbehavioral health issues.  I cannot imagine that we have never had to use that, but I will let \nsomeone else with more data tell us more about that.   \n \nI also want to clarify treatment and right to treatment, but I believe NAC 441A.200 already \nstates that the health board does not have the ability to interfere with a person's right to \ntreatment and it reads both ways—to have treatment or not to have treatment.  I think that is \nalready covered in status quo, that there is nothing in our statute.  That person already has the \nability to accept care or not accept care. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe have our committee counsel on Zoom, and she may be able to further clarify this.   \n \nKarly O'Krent, Committee Counsel: \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson was correct in referencing NAC 441A.200.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any other questions? \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nI think it is important in this conversation to get on the record the advances that have been \nmade around the treatment and reduction of risk related to contraction and prevention of \nHIV, because that is what is changing the narrative around how people engage in the world \nafter they have become positive with HIV.  Could someone talk to the advancement in those \nantiviral drugs, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis \n(PEP), and what those have meant to the potential risk for HIV contraction? \n \nSenator Harris: \nI will turn that over to Mr. Wade or Mr. Sears to answer that question. \n \nBrad Sears: \nDefinitely, when you think about the time during which these laws were passed, we had no \neffective treatments for treating HIV or for preventing HIV.  We were several years out from \neven having a test to identify the virus.  Since the mid-1990s, a few years after the last one of \nthese laws was passed, we have had those effective medications, so in the mid-1990s, you \nsaw death and illness rates drop.  You also saw transmission drop.  What we know today, and \nwhat  we  have  just  learned  in  the  last  few  years,  is  that  if  you  are  on  those  effective \nmedications and you have an undetectable viral load, you cannot—and for someone who has \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 3, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nbeen doing this for decades, that is hard to even digest—transmit the virus through sex.  We \nthink, and as this other research is growing, you also cannot transmit it through other means. \n \nThese laws take none of that into account, just the fact that having HIV is no longer a death \nsentence—there are other illnesses that have, on average, more serious consequences—and \nthat for people who are HIV-positive, their ability to transmit is greatly reduced.  Part of \nthose effective medications is, if you think you have been exposed, you can do post-exposure \nprophylaxis, or post-exposure treatment, that is highly effective at preventing even after \nexposure to HIV.  Also proven to be very effective is a pre-exposure prophylaxis, so we have \na growing number of people who are at high risk, who take the medications even though they \nare not HIV-positive, so if they ever become exposed, they are no longer HIV-positive. \n \nI want to pick up on an earlier comment.  You cannot police your way out of a pandemic.  \nWe have shown that now with HIV; we are showing that with COVID-19.  But giving people \naccess to treatment and to pre-exposure and post-exposure medication is a way to really fight \nHIV. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nMr.  Wade,  would  you  mind  talking  a  little  bit  about  access  to  PEP  and  PrEP  in \nClark County? \n \nAndré Wade: \nCurrently,  there  are  PrEP/PEP  navigation  services  in  place.    As  an  example,  Southern \nNevada Health District has it.  I believe the LGBTQ Center of Southern Nevada and perhaps \nother organizations do also.  They help individuals learn about and access PrEP medication \nwith or without their insurance coverage.  You have the Huntridge Family Clinic in southern \nNevada that provides PrEP and PEP medication for free for those who are unable to afford \nthe medication or have trouble accessing it.  There is a statewide effort to have PrEP become \nmore available, so as another plug for a bill, Senate Bill 325, that is moving through the \nlegislative  session,  would  allow  pharmacists  to  prescribe  PrEP  and  PEP  to  individuals \nwithout a prescription as well as ancillary services related to the medication which will \ngreatly increase access to this medication, which would then greatly decrease the risk of \ntransmission and have us begin to truly get to where the rates of HIV infection are lower in \nNevada.  Right now, we are the state with the highest rate of new diagnoses and people living \nwith HIV west of the Mississippi.  We really need to combat this, so having on-the-ground, \ncommunity access to medications like PEP and PrEP, having pharmacists be able to prescribe \nit, and a lot of the other public education that is going on, would help folks have access.  We \nare still having to educate medical providers on this medication to better inform them, and so \nthat access continues to increase. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nThank you for the responses, I appreciate that.  I think it is amazing how far science has \ncome in relation to this disease.  I believe that all the work and effort being done to ensure \npeople have access to these preventive medications and treatments are really going to benefit \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 3, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nthe state, not just in access to, but also destigmatizing asking for a test and making sure you \nare getting proactive treatment. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAt this time, I will begin testimony in support of S.B. 275 (R1). \n \nCarlo Miciano, Community Liaison, Southern Nevada Asian Pacific Islander Queer \nSociety: \nI am a registered nurse and speaking on behalf of the Southern Nevada Asian Pacific Islander \nQueer Society.  I am in support of S.B. 275 (R1), HIV modernization, because it focuses on \ndecriminalization of individuals based on their HIV status.  As it exists now, Nevada law is \ndiscriminatory and disproportionately affects communities of color, especially Black people, \nsex workers, and the LGBTQIA+ community.  As a nurse, HIV is a public health issue and it \nis very concerning to encounter patients who are newly diagnosed with HIV in a hospital \nsetting because they fear seeking tests and treatment and continued care that goes beyond \neducation of safe sex practices—when they are newly diagnosed in the hospital setting but it \ncould have been caught much sooner if they had not been afraid to seek out resources.   \n \nThe passing of S.B. 275 (R1) would be a strong start in ending the HIV epidemic and \ndestigmatizing HIV as an illness; to normalizing talking about using condoms; to getting on \nHIV medications and antiretrovirals, PEP, PrEP; and, of course, monitoring one's HIV status \nwithout public scrutiny.  The dialogue and the stigma around HIV need to be changed in \norder to properly address the health crisis.  \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe will go to our next person in support, and I am turning over chairing duties to Vice Chair \nPeters as I have to go present a bill. \n \n[Assemblywoman Peters assumed the Chair.] \n \nSenator Harris: \nI want to get one more thing on the record.  I want the Committee to know that the \naffirmative defenses in this bill are aimed at consensual conduct—two people might engage \nin activities that may be risky, but people have the right to engage.  The scope of it is not \nintended to extend to other circumstances such as a first responder responding to a call, who \nwould not know if someone had a communicable disease and would not consent to the \nconduct to transmit the disease, had they known that, and I just want that on the record. \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nThank you, and we will go on to support testimony. \n \nKendra  G.  Bertschy,  Deputy  Public  Defender,  Washoe  County  Public  Defender's \nOffice; and representing Clark County Public Defender's Office: \nWe want to thank the sponsors for bringing forward this incredibly important bill to allow \nour state to join the effort of the growing number of states that have modernized their \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 3, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \ncriminal laws to remove these prevention issues from our felony criminal statutes.  Just \nregarding the fact of the misdemeanor, I want to add that intention is extremely important.  \nWe believe this strikes that balance between a status versus a conduct offense, so it is \npunishing those intending harm while trying to ensure that those who are innocent actors and \nmay accidentally be caught up in this are not caught up in the criminal laws.  We believe it \nwill help reduce stigma and make prevention issues public health issues rather than criminal \njustice  issues.    As  you  have  heard,  HIV  criminalization  laws  have  been  shown  to  be \ndisproportionately impacting women, Black communities, and our vulnerable populations.  \nWe agree with the statements from the sponsors as to why it is important to decriminalize \nthese issues, why it is necessary, warranted, and justified. \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nPlease open the phone lines for those in support of S.B. 275 (R1). \n \nAlex Camberos, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \n[Alex Camberos presented written testimony, Exhibit M].  I am speaking in support of \nS.B. 275 (R1).  Current Nevada laws regarding HIV criminalization are outdated, ineffective, \nand discriminatory.  These laws were first established decades ago during the height of the \nHIV/AIDS  epidemic  when  little  was  known  about  it.    This  led  to  disproportionate \nmarginalization of gender and sexual minorities in communities of color, especially Black \npeople.  We cannot punish HIV-positive Nevadans, but we have so few state and community \nresources  available  to  them.    This  criminalization  perpetuates  a  stigma  in  discouraging \ntesting, treatment, and disclosure.  We should be promoting all methods available to reduce \ntransmission and treatment of HIV.  Senate Bill 275 (1st Reprint) will modernize Nevada's \noutdated HIV laws to eliminate the stigma and promote public health.  If people in the state \nwant to end the HIV epidemic, we should support S.B. 275 (R1).  \n \nConnie Rose Shearer, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \nI am a long-term survivor of HIV for 25 years.  I am one of the cochairs for the Nevada HIV \nModernization Coalition and I am a member of the Advisory Task Force on HIV Exposure \nModernization.  I would like to thank the Assembly members for taking time today to hear \ninformation about this bill.  I want to say a huge thank you to former Senator David Parks \nand Senator Dallas Harris for championing this bill for us. \n \nI am here today to talk about why we should all care about reforming the outdated HIV \ncriminalization  laws  in  Nevada.    We  have  made  significant  advances  in  our  scientific \nunderstanding of HIV and the medical interventions available to cure it.  Our laws should \nreflect  this  progress  and  they  should  not  criminalize  behavior  that  poses  no  risk  of \ntransmission.  I am what is known as virally suppressed.  That means the virus I have inside \nme is suppressed by the medication I take daily, called antiretroviral therapy.  There are \nmultiple clinical studies that scientifically prove that I am unable to transmit HIV to someone \nI am having a sexual relationship with.  And there are also many studies to prove that the \npeople who are transmitting right now are mostly all untested and out of treatment from fear \nof being criminalized.   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 3, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \nThe way the current laws are written is preventing people from getting tested, which prevents \nthem from getting into treatment—treatment that we now know prevents the spread of HIV.  \nPeople have a fear of being criminalized because, not only do convictions for these crimes \nnot require transmission or the specific intent to transmit HIV, most do not even require \nconduct that could transmit the virus.  This includes almost all solicitation- and prostitution-\nrelated convictions, and nowhere in there does it discuss the fact of how many times I have \nbeen falsely accused by people who are leaving a relationship with me and get angry that \nhow dare I, a person living with HIV, leave them, a person who is not living with HIV, to go \nfind something better. \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nThat was two minutes.  If you have additional testimony you would like to submit in writing, \nyou can submit that to the Committee via the email address on the agenda.  Thank you for \nsharing your story and for your comments. \n \nJasmin Margarita Tobon, Organizer, Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada: \nPlanned Parenthood Votes Nevada is in favor of S.B. 275 (R1).  Current Nevada law treats \nthe  HIV  epidemic  as  a  criminal  offense  rather  than  a  public  health  crisis  as  has  been \npresented  today.    With  science  and  with  knowledge  we  know  better,  so  this  is  our \nopportunity to do better.  Criminalization is not the answer; it never was.  Science is.  Despite \nadvances in HIV care and science like PrEP—pre-exposure prophylaxis—and undetectable \nequals untransmittable—or \"U Equals U\"—Nevada's HIV criminalization laws are still based \non decades-old science.  Criminalization discourages testing, treatment, and disclosure, and \nresults  in  stigma  and  preventable  steps.    Whether  it  is  the  horribly  mismanaged  AIDS \nepidemic in the 1990s, or the coronavirus pandemic, BIPOC [Black, Indigenous, and People \nof Color] and LGBTQ+ individuals suffer the most.  They have been the ones leading the \nmovement for justice for their communities.  This bill is an act of long-overdue justice and \naligns with the needs of Nevadans.  Please support S.B. 275 (R1). \n \nChristine Saunders, Policy Director, Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada: \n[Christine Saunders submitted a letter in support, Exhibit N].  I am here in support of \nS.B. 275 (R1).  In the interest of time, I want to echo the sentiments of those who spoke \nbefore me and will submit my additional remarks for the record.  Our current laws cause far \nmore harm than good, increasing the stigma around HIV, discouraging people from seeking \ntesting, and further criminalizing communities of color.  Senate Bill 275 (1st Reprint) would \nhelp  modernize  these  laws  to  support  modern  science  and  help  end  the  HIV  epidemic \nbecause HIV is a public health issue, not a criminal issue.  Our state laws should reflect that. \nWe are in support of this legislation. \n \nLeann  McAllister,  Executive  Director,  Nevada  Chapter,  American  Academy  of \nPediatrics: \n[Leann McAllister submitted a letter in support, Exhibit O].  Today I offer support on behalf \nof the Nevada Chapter, American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), for S.B. 275 (R1).  Laws \ncriminalizing  HIV  exposure  and  transmission  perpetuate  the  stigma  around  HIV  and  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 3, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \ndiscourage people from getting tested. The AAP joins the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (CDC) in calling on states to revise old laws that do not reflect our current \nunderstanding of HIV.  The Nevada AAP currently has more than 250 members, most of \nwhom are board-certified pediatricians—both primary and specialty care.  Members also \ninclude pediatric nurse practitioners, physician assistants, pediatric residents, and medical \nstudents, all of whom live and work in Nevada and have dedicated their professional lives to \nthe health of all children, adolescents, and young adults.  Thank you to Senator Harris for \nsponsoring S.B.  275  (R1).    We  encourage  all  adolescents  to  talk to  their  doctor  about \nprevention and getting tested.    \n \nVince  Collins,  Director,  Community  Wellness,  The  LGBTQ  Center  of  Southern \nNevada: \nI also sit on the Governor's Advisory Task Force on HIV Exposure and Modernization, and it \nis an honor to do so.  Today I am offering my support for S.B. 275 (R1) and would like to \nthank everyone who has contributed to the hard work in getting this bill to where it is today.  \nAlso, I want to acknowledge, on behalf of over 13,000 persons living with HIV and AIDS in \nNevada  and  the  hundreds  of  newly  diagnosed  individuals,  having  the  courage  to  live \na healthy and meaningful life, for many of these people, the starting point is confirmation of \ndiagnosis and linkage to medical care and other services, and their education as persons \nliving with HIV with organizations such as ours.  As an organization that provides free HIV \ntesting and counseling, we rely on accurate and current scientific information provided by the \nfederal government, state, and local leaders to inform our service providers as well as to \nconvey to our clients what is true and factual. \n \nWe need our current laws to be consistent with the science and with what is true and factual.  \nThis information needs to be provided throughout the state so everyone better understands \ntheir roles and responsibilities and to better address the stigma associated with people living \nwith HIV and AIDS.  This bill tries to do so, and I urge you to support it.  Thank you for \nyour time and your support. \n \nWesley Juhl, Director, Communications and Outreach, American Civil Liberties Union \nof Nevada: \nWe support S.B. 275 (R1) and the work to take harmful stigma out of our state laws.  As a \nqueer man, my experience has always been that discussions about HIV and AIDS are far too \noften tangled up in homophobia and transphobia, and my sense is that the same is true with \nNevada's current criminalization scheme.  When looking at the groups most vulnerable to \ncontracting HIV and the groups most vulnerable to criminal enforcement, it is clear that it is \nalso tangled up with racial, gender, and economic justice concerns.  I encourage you to \nreview the new analysis from the Williams Institute that was presented [Exhibit L].  I want to \nrepeat that stark racial justice statistic:  Black Nevadans make up 40 percent of those arrested \nfor HIV crimes.  I would also note that some of the first volunteer work I ever did was HIV \nprevention outreach and we always told the community—get tested and know your status.  \nThe sad truth I hope you see now is that Nevada's criminalization of HIV serves as a major \nobstacle to these important public health messages because it creates an environment in \nwhich people are afraid to be tested.  This is a great opportunity to update our laws to align \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 3, 2021 \nPage 27 \n \nwith modern science and to remove the stigma that gets in the way of the work we need to do \nto address this epidemic.  Please listen to community members who are impacted by the HIV \nepidemic and please do pass S.B. 275 (R1). \n \nSarah K. Hawkins, President, Nevada Attorneys for Criminal Justice: \nThank you for the opportunity to speak this afternoon and thank you especially to Senator \nHarris  and  today's  presenters  for  championing  this  important  and  impactful  legislation.   \nNevada Attorneys for Criminal Justice stands in solidarity with the LGBTQIA+ community, \ntheir advocates, and community allies.  Our position is very simple:  We unequivocally \nsupport  S.B.  275  (R1)  passage  and  urge  this  Committee  to  do  the  same.  Without \ncompromising public health and safety, S.B. 275 (R1) accords the privacy, protection, care, \nequality, and human dignity to which all Nevadans are entitled.  Please pass S.B. 275 (R1).  \n        \nDawn  Christensen,  Vice  President,  Communications  and  Corporate  Responsibility, \nNevada Resort Association: \nNevada's resort industry has a long-standing commitment to corporate social responsibility \n(CSR) programs and initiatives and has a history of leadership in the space.  The key pillars \nof most CSR programs are philanthropy, environmental sustainability, and diversity, equity, \nand  inclusion,  which  work  in  tandem  to  strengthen  our  communities  and  create  better \noutcomes for people and the planet.  Much of our members' CSR work focuses on increasing \naccess, opportunity, and equity for all, and it is under this principle of fairness and equality \nthat I speak in support of modernizing HIV laws.  We have not had an opportunity to go \nthrough the amendment that was recently posted to review that language, but recognizing the \noverall intent of the bill, I would like to echo many of the previous comments and agree it is \ntime to update the law.  We hope you take into consideration the recommendations presented \nby the state HIV Modernization Task Force that helped shaped S.B. 275 (R1).  In closing, \nI would like to thank the bill's sponsor, Senator Harris, for her leadership on this legislation \nand on equality and equity matters.  I would also like to thank former Senator Parks for his \nlong time dedication to LGBTQ equality and his years of hard work in laying the foundation \nfor  this  bill.    Thank  you  again,  Vice  Chair  Peters  and  Committee  members,  for  the \nopportunity to speak with you.   \n \nLuis Aceves, Development Manager, Research, Education and Access for Community \nHealth, Las Vegas, Nevada: \nI  am  the  development  manager  for  R.E.A.C.H.,  Research,  Education  and  Access  for \nCommunity  Health.    We  primarily  serve  the  Hispanic,  Spanish-speaking  population  in \nsouthern Nevada.  We are in support of S.B. 275 (R1) which will modernize our HIV laws in \nNevada.  HIV is not a crime and our laws should reflect that as soon as possible.      \n \nKimi Cole, Private Citizen, Carson City, Nevada: \nThank you, Vice Chair Peters, and to the Committee.  Understanding of HIV long ago passed \noriginal archaic, inaccurate understandings of an affliction that can be effectively monitored \nand treated for long-term quality of life.  There is a great opportunity here to accurately and \neffectively recognize scientific understanding of human immunodeficiency virus and to pass \nlegislation that will improve public health while sparing taxpayers the unnecessary burden of \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 3, 2021 \nPage 28 \n \npaying for onerous and ineffective prosecutions.  Laws that have done nothing to mitigate \nissues  that  were  originally  and  erroneously  intended  to  help  protect  society  actually \naccomplished quite the opposite.  Almost all of the HIV convictions in Nevada do not \ninvolve  any  conduct  that  could  actually  transmit  HIV.    Outdated  laws  criminalize  an \naffliction, not the actions that cause intentional harm to others.  It is time to correct this \nsituation and move on.  I urge your support of S.B. 275 (R1). \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nDo we have any other callers in support at this time?  [There were none.]  Do we have \nanyone to testify in opposition?  [There was no one.]  Is there anyone to testify in neutral? \n \nBradley Mayer, representing Southern Nevada Health District: \nI am testifying in neutral today on behalf of the Southern Nevada Health District.  I want to \nthank former Senator Parks for his advocacy on this issue over the years and Senator Harris \nfor her extremely hard work, along with the other advocates, on updating our HIV laws.   \n \nAs I mentioned in a previous testimony, because this bill would have an impact on all \ncommunicable diseases, we have been working very diligently in several iterations as a \nworking group to make sure it does not impact public health's ability to address those \ncommunicable  diseases  because  of  us  updating  this  law.    We  proposed  an  amendment \n[Exhibit D] that was submitted on behalf of the Washoe County Health District and the \nSouthern Nevada Health District in order to ensure that is happening, because in section 1 of \nthe bill [page 6, Exhibit D] they were looking to add \"infectious state\" to the language.  We \nproposed some language that allows us to isolate, quarantine, treat, and monitor those in an \ninfectious state, and we made a conforming change to that in section 2 [page 8] and section 5 \n[page 9], as well, for city, county, and local health authorities.  And then, section 9 of the bill \nhas an amendment from us that also adds language about a person diagnosed with or exposed \nto a communicable disease.  We really appreciate the work of the bill's sponsor and the \nadvocates on this, and we thank them for working with us.  We will continue to work with \nthem if there are any additional changes before work session on this bill, and we thank you \nfor your time. \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nAre there any questions related to the amendment? \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nI am curious about section 6, subsection 7, paragraph (a) [page 12, line 191, Exhibit D], \nwhich I read as an exclusion to subsection 4.  Section 6, subsection 4 sets out who can be \nheld liable for knowingly and intentionally acting in a way to spread their communicable \ndisease but there is an exception for the person who is donating organs or tissues.  Is that \nbecause those organs and tissues will be tested anyway?  I am curious about that exclusion. \n \nBradley Mayer: \nI would defer to Jennifer Howell if she is still on in regard to that question. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 3, 2021 \nPage 29 \n \nJennifer Howell: \nCould you repeat your question for me, please? \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nAs I read section 6, subsection 4, if you knowingly act in a way to specifically transmit your \ncommunicable disease, there is some liability.  But section 6, subsection 7(a) carves out a \nperson who knowingly donates tissues or an organ with the specific intent to transmit their \ndisease.  As I read subsection 7(a), they are not liable.  Presumably, their tissues will be \ntested, is that why we are carving it out?  What is the theory of carving them out? \n \nJennifer Howell: \nMy apologies, this area of affirmative defense and that kind of thing is not my expertise.  \nPerhaps Brad Sears could help. \n \nBrad Sears: \nThe chance of actually infecting someone, even if intended, by donating blood or an organ, is \ninfinitesimally remote.  Our blood supply has been extremely well protected.  I think the last \ndocumented infection of HIV in the blood supply happened well over a decade ago in 2008 \nor 2009.  The donation of organs quite frequently happens after someone already passed \naway so there is no prosecution.  But you are absolutely correct.  In either case, the reason \nwhy our blood supply is so safe is that we have testing of the blood supply.  The amount of \ntests of anyone who is alive and is donating an organ would be extensive for the donor and \nthe person receiving the organ.   \n \nSince we have done similar analysis now in five states, I can say that this type of crime, for \nexample as you see in California, has almost never been enforced.  It is on the books in some \nstates but never has any enforcement action.  There is an affirmative reason to signal that \nsome types of donations are encouraged.  For a long time, people with HIV could not even \ndonate organs to other people with HIV even though there is a federal law that calls for that.  \nThere is a practice that has been developed that has allowed that to happen.  When we \nrepealed that law in California, there was a waiting list of about 40 people with HIV in San \nFrancisco who could not get organ donations from other people with HIV until we repealed \nthat law.  So there is some positive value to signaling this is an okay thing. \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nIs there additional neutral testimony? \n \nJoelle Gutman Dodson, representing Washoe County Health District: \nWe are testifying in neutral today; however, we plan to move to full support if and when the \nfriendly amendment proposed earlier today by Bradley Mayer is adopted.  We want to thank \nSenator Harris for her countless hours of work on this bill as well as the working group task \nforce, and of course former Senator Parks, for bringing Nevada into modern times.  This bill \nhas been a lot of work for a lot of people working on this important piece of legislation.  \nHIV modernization and decriminalization are priorities while maintaining the local health \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 3, 2021 \nPage 30 \n \ndistrict's ability to investigate all communicable diseases as needed to maintain the public \nhealth of our community.  \n \nJoanna Jacob, Government Affairs Manager, Clark County: \nWe are testifying in neutral today.  We engaged on this bill on behalf of the Clark County \nFire Department, and specifically section 7.  In its original form, there was some language in \nthere that we believed would perhaps unintentionally throw active barriers to getting our first \nresponders tested if they are, during the course and scope of their employment, exposed to \na communicable disease.  Senator Harris and members of the working group, everybody who \nworked on this did work with us in response to our concerns and you have an amended \nversion before you which we are neutral on.  We also appreciate Senator Harris's clarification \nthat she put on record today about the affirmative defenses.  We absolutely support the intent \nof this bill and the move toward decriminalization and approaching communicable diseases \nfrom a public health perspective based on accurate and scientific evidence and that is why we \nhave continued to work on this bill.  Thank you to all who have been involved.  We are \nneutral on the bill. \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nIs there anyone else calling in neutral? \n \nAlyssa Howard, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \nI called in support of the bill, but my number did not get called.  Can I still testify in support \nof the bill? \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nYes, absolutely.  We will reclassify your testimony as in support. \n \nAlisa Howard: \nAs a former HIV program director and now the owner of Minority Health Consultants where \nI still bring HIV health education advances to priority populations in Clark County, I am in \nsupport of S.B. 275 (R1).  As we now have heard several times over, Nevada's laws that \ncriminalize HIV are outdated, ineffective, and discriminatory.  The CDC and state data show \nthat HIV has one of the highest mortality and morbidity rates from an infectious disease, \naside from the latest COVID-19, that threatens the lives of minorities, to include African \nAmericans,  Latinx  communities,  and  LGBT  communities.    Our  current  laws  treat  HIV \ndifferently from every other communicable disease.  It is the only one listed in Nevada's \npenal code and the only one for which activities that may risk transmission carry a felony \ncharge for the first event.  Not only do these laws fail to prevent the spread of HIV, but they \nalso make it hard to end the epidemic by discouraging testing, treatment, and disclosure.  As \na person who hosts HIV community and Black community discussions and events, I can \ntestify that the stigma around HIV still hinders these communities greatly from knowing their \nstatus and, therefore, taking care of their overall health.  The modernization in this bill will \nhelp these communities and the overall state see HIV in alignment with other communicable \ndiseases  and  not  as  separate,  making  people  living  with  this  virus  feel  a  part  of  the \ncommunity and not separate.  Thank you for listening and for your time. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 3, 2021 \nPage 31 \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nIs there anyone calling in neutral?  [There was no one.]  I would ask the bill's sponsor for \nclosing remarks if you have them. \n \nSenator Harris: \nThis is a big one, folks.  We have an opportunity to move the ball forward significantly.  It is \nbased upon a lot of work by stakeholders, not to mention the HIV Modernization Task Force, \nwhich will be renewed in this legislation in case there are further changes we need to make in \nour search for equality.  Again, I want to shout out former Senator David Parks for all his \nwork and what he has done to get us to this point.  We would not be here without him.  \nThank you for your time, and I look forward to seeing you all at the work session. \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nThank you, Senator Harris and thank you, Senator Parks, for your continued advocacy for \nthis issue and the issues around LGBTQ+ communities.  With that, I will close the hearing \non S.B. 275 (R1).  I will open the hearing on Senate Bill 305 (1st Reprint). \n \nSenate  Bill  305  (1st  Reprint):    Makes  various  changes  relating  to  access  to  organ \ntransplants for persons with disabilities. (BDR 40-40) \n \nSenator Scott Hammond, Senate District No. 18:  \nSenate Bill 305 (1st Reprint) prohibits certain providers of medical or related services from \ntaking certain actions related to organ transplants solely on the basis of a person's disability.  \nI will tell you five things this bill does—four things it does do and one thing it does not do: \n  \n1)  It prohibits certain providers of medical-related services from taking certain actions \nof related organ transplants solely on the basis of a person's disability. \n \n2)  It authorizes a person aggrieved by the failure of such providers to comply with \ncertain requirements to institute a civil action for injunctive or other appropriate \nrelief. \n \n3)  It prohibits an insurer from taking certain actions related to an organ transplant \nbecause the insured is a person with a disability. \n \n4)  It prevents a provider of health care services from not  placing a person with a \ndisability on a transplant list or placing a patient low on the transplant list because of \ntheir disability. \n \n5)  Senate Bill 305 (1st Reprint) does not take away a physician's ability to diagnose a \npatient and determine whether or not the patient is eligible for or a good fit for a \nparticular organ transplant.  \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 3, 2021 \nPage 32 \n \nWe are attempting to ensure people with disabilities, whether intellectual or cognitive, are \nnot denied an organ transplant because of their disability. \n \nI will now turn over my time to Ms. Chesin. \n \nRachael Chesin, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \n[Rachael Chesin presented a PowerPoint, Exhibit P]  I am excited to be here today in support \nof S.B. 305 (R1), Caleb's Law.  I was born and raised here in the Las Vegas community.  \nI am the community engagement director of The Just One Project, which is a local nonprofit \nhere in town, and I am a fierce disability advocate.  I share our journey via Instagram, on \nFacebook, and on ALittleExtraLove.com, which tells a little about why I love Caleb's Law \nand why we are trying to get this to happen. \n \nI am here because I would like to tell you about my son, Caleb [page 4, Exhibit P].  He is \n22 months old; he is happy, healthy, and extraordinary in every way.  He goes to preschool \npart-time.  He hangs out with his grandma on the weekend; he is learning sign language; \nloves to go to the park; and he participates in brand campaigns emphasizing inclusion \nthroughout  the  community.    Caleb  also  happens  to  have  a  third  copy  on  his  twenty-\nfirst chromosome—or Down syndrome—or what I call his \"extra love\" that makes him \nexactly who he is.   He is the best thing that ever happened to me.  Because of his diagnosis, \nI have been an active member of the disability community for a couple of years now, and \nwithin the community, there was a story I heard that stood out to me as being almost \nunbelievable.  It was a story about a little girl named Ellie, not even a year old and living \nwith her family in Ohio and in need of a heart.  The doctors told Ellie's mom that Ellie was \nnot eligible for a heart transplant, not because she was too sick or because of any medically \nsignificant reason; she was not eligible for a transplant simply because she had an intellectual \ndisability [page 5].  Her life was not worth saving because of an extra chromosome. \n \nWhen I heard Ellie's story, I immediately assumed it must be an anomaly—a one-off, some \nrogue group of doctors acting outside the typical standard of care.  What I found, though, was \nmuch  worse.    Story  after  story—a  ten-year-old  boy  named  Leif  in  Oregon,  denied \na transplant because he has autism; Amelia Rivera, a three-year-old, denied a kidney in \nPennsylvania  because  she  has  Wolf-Hirschhorn  syndrome;  a  five-month-old  named \nMaverick, denied a heart in New York because of another rare chromosomal disorder similar \nto Down Syndrome, and that is when it hit me.  My son Caleb is perfectly healthy now; no \nmedical concerns to speak of other than some trouble from being born premature that he has \ngrown up with.  If he needed an organ transplant tomorrow, it would be because of an \naccident or trauma.  It would have nothing to do with his diagnosis of Down syndrome, yet \nstudies  show  85  percent  of  pediatric  transplant  centers  would  take  Caleb's  intellectual \ndisability into account.  Seventy-one percent of heart programs indicate that even mild or \nmoderate cognitive impairment is enough to disqualify him from the organ transplant list, \nand  the  survey  showed  that  transplant  centers  always  or  usually  considered  intellectual \ndisability  (ID)/developmental  disability  (DD)  diagnoses  when  deciding  eligibility  for \ntransplantation. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 3, 2021 \nPage 33 \n \nFifty-two percent of people with ID/DD receive a referral for a specialist evaluation and \n33 percent of that 52 percent who are referred are never evaluated.  Story after story, and it \nhappened again in February 2019 at the University of North Carolina (UNC).  They were \nforced to resolve an investigation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \n(HHS)  after  they  denied  someone  a  heart  transplant  simply  because  he  had  a  learning \ndisability.  When their actions were challenged, UNC immediately reversed course, with \nHHS  issuing  this  statement:    The  director  of  the  Office  for  Civil  Rights  at  the  U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Roger Severino, said, \"Every life is precious and \nno one should be blocked from access to an organ transplant because of stereotypes about \npersons with disabilities.  It is also against the law.\"  And that is an important point. \n \nThe reason I am here today is for support to ban organ transplant discrimination here in \nNevada,  but  we  are  not  asking  the  state  to  do  anything  new  [page  6,  Exhibit  P].  \nDiscrimination  in  medical  services  is  already  illegal  under  the  federal  Americans  with \nDisabilities Act of 1990 (ADA).  The problem is enforcement.  There is no easy way for you \nor me to enforce the ADA because it has no mechanism for enforcement.  In practical terms, \nthat leaves us, the state of Nevada, on our own to not just prevent discrimination, but to give \npeople an effective way to challenge discrimination when and where it happens.  That is \nwhere Caleb's Law comes in. \n \nCaleb's Law clarifies that doctors, hospital transplants, and other health care providers are \nprohibited  from  denying  access  to  necessary  organ  transplants  solely  on  the  basis  of \na qualified individual's disability [page 7].  It requires that health providers consider in \nevaluating the likelihood of a transplant's success the full range of supports available to help \na  person  with  a  disability  manage  their  postoperative  care;  and  includes  a  fast-track \nprocedure for challenging discrimination to ensure that people in urgent need of an organ \ntransplant can obtain timely resolutions to their claims.  I have already reached out to doctors \nall  over  the  state,  the  heads  of  multiple  transplant  centers  throughout  the  country,  the \nAmerican  Heart  Association,  Children's  Heart  Center  Nevada,  and  Opportunity  Village.  \nI have not heard one word of opposition to this bill.  None.  Overwhelmingly, even from the \nmedical community, the response seems to be one of understanding. \n \nThis is a bill that represents a significant step forward in the protection of people with \ndisabilities in the state of Nevada and it should be passed.  One last thing, 15 states have \nalready passed similar laws to this and another 13 states have similar bills pending here in \n2021  right  now.    In  almost  every  instance,  though,  those  bills  were  proposed  because \nsomeone with a disability was in desperate and immediate need of a lifesaving transplant and \nwas facing unfair discrimination.  It is my hope that we do not wait for a similar story here in \nNevada.  It is my hope that you can support us in passing Caleb's Law. \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nThank you, Ms. Chesin, and thank you for sharing your story about Caleb and the others.  \nWe really appreciate your being here to do that and for bringing this bill.  Senator Hammond, \ndo you have additional comments before we move on to questions? \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 3, 2021 \nPage 34 \n \nSenator Hammond: \nNo, I do not.  We are ready for questions. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nThank you so much.  You have a reference to the supported decision-making language \nin here, meaning to make sure the helpers that we acknowledge in law are able to help \na person should they need that.  However, this specific Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) \nreference looks pretty specific to just the supported helpers, but would it encapsulate to \nNRS Chapter 162A which is the power of attorney for adults with intellectual disabilities—\nonce again having that other place in statute where we acknowledge helpers who are helping \nour ID community? \n \nSenator Hammond: \nThat is a good question for legal counsel because what we are looking at is to make sure that \nwhen there is an occasion where there is a transplant, that person then has help if the parents \nare not available—that they have someone there. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI appreciate that, so for intent, we want it.  For the over-18, we have passed some bills to \nmake sure that adults with intellectual disabilities were not having to always surrender their \ncivil rights in order to go to the dentist, for instance, to sign a permission for anesthesia.  That \nis just another place in the law where we have helpers identified in making health care \ndecisions.  Unless someone tells me it is contrary, it would be good to have those places \nwhere we reference such things in the same spirit of supporting it. \n \nSenator Hammond: \nI absolutely agree with you. \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nKarly O'Krent, our legal counsel, would like to respond. \n \nKarly O'Krent, Legal Counsel: \nI noted what Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson mentioned and I am happy to look into \nthat and work with her and with the Committee to ensure that the bill addresses those \ncircumstances. \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nGreat.  Thank you so much.  Getting that to the rest of the Committee would be helpful \nas well. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nSenator Hammond, thank you for bringing this bill forward—Caleb's Law.  Caleb is a \nbeautiful child; thank you to his mom for sharing his story.  How often are people with \ndisabilities experiencing this type of discrimination? \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 3, 2021 \nPage 35 \n \nSenator Hammond: \nI will defer to Ms. Chesin. \n \nRachael Chesin: \nI am pretty positive that it happens quite often.  We have story after story within our \ndisability community, specifically in the Down syndrome community.  That is why this law \nis sweeping the country by a storm right now, because it is happening so often within the \ncountry. \n \nSenator Hammond: \nI will check and report an exact number back to the Committee.   \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nMy question is along the lines of Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson and thinking about \nother circumstances in which there could be discrimination.  As Ms. Chesin observed, the \nADA prohibits this kind of thing but there is no enforcement, so it strikes me there are \nprobably other kinds of discrimination prohibited by the ADA that there is no private right of \naction for either.  It would be nice if we addressed those as well so that we could have more.  \nI know it is hard to change people's bills, but if we have this vehicle to make sure there is \nalways a private right of action for people who are discriminated under the ADA, that would \nbe a nice thing to do. \n \nSenator Hammond: \nI completely agree.  I do not know if you have language in mind or if we have an exhaustive \nlist, but I would certainly welcome a conversation with you about this. \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nThank you.  I will follow up. \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nAre there any other questions from the Committee?  Seeing none, I think we are ready to \nmove on to support testimony S.B. 305 (R1). \n \nTahnee Forlini, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \nI am a board-certified clinical pharmacist specializing in emergency medicine here in Las \nVegas and also the mother to an amazing little boy who just happens to have trisomy 21, or \nDown syndrome.  I am speaking to you today in support of S.B. 305 (R1) for the equal \naccess of organ transplants for individuals with disabilities.  For centuries, individuals with \nphysical and intellectual disabilities have been discriminated against.  Individuals in this \ncountry have been institutionalized and neglected as recently as the 1970s.  Disability rights \nhave come a long way since the passing of the ADA in 1990, but the struggle continues—\nfrom access to equal education rights, job opportunities, and quality health care—much work \nstill needs to be done.  Senate Bill 305 (1st Reprint) is a step in the right direction in allowing \nall individuals the same access to lifesaving transplants.  Individuals with disabilities have \nfulfilling lives filled with joy and love and family and support.  This bill helps ensure they \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 3, 2021 \nPage 36 \n \nreceive the same care and consideration as anyone else in our community and needs to be \npassed, as it supports basic human rights and ensures that people like my son will have \na chance to live the life they are so deserving of and that so many of us continue to fight for.  \nThank you for your time. \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nThank you for your testimony.  Are there other callers in support?  [There were none.]  We \nwill now move into opposition testimony for S.B. 305 (R1).  [There was none.]  Is there \ntestimony in neutral?  [There was none.]  With that, I will invite the bill's sponsor to make \nclosing remarks. \n \nSenator Hammond: \nThank you for your time and for your questions, and I am willing to take any further \nconversation offline. \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nThank you so much; and thank you, Ms. Chesin, for your testimony as well as for your \nadvocacy on this bill.  With that, I will close the hearing on S.B. 305 (R1) and we will move \non to our next agenda item—public comment.  Is there anyone who wishes to make public \ntestimony?  [There was no one.]  Are there any comments from Committee members before \nwe  adjourn?    [There  were  none.]    That  concludes  our  meeting  for  today.

The Chair reminded Committee members, witnesses, and members of the \naudience of Committee rules, protocol, and procedures for virtual meetings.]  We will now \nmove to our first agenda item, which is the work session.  For the audience's information, \nI will be taking Senate Bill 188 (1st Reprint) off the work session. \n \nSenate Bill 188 (1st Reprint):  Establishes programs for certain persons of low-income \nand persons in foster care. (BDR 38-711) \n \n[This bill was not considered.] \n \nI will start at the top with Senate Bill 21 (1st Reprint).   \n \nSenate  Bill  21  (1st  Reprint):    Revises  requirements  relating  to  background \ninvestigations conducted by certain institutions, agencies and facilities that serve \nchildren. (BDR 5-303) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \nAs a nonpartisan member of the Legislative Counsel Bureau, I cannot advocate or oppose \nany measures that come before you today.  We thought we might have a consent calendar \ntoday; however, we will just move through every bill on the work session.   \n \nWe  will  start  with  Senate  Bill  21  (1st  Reprint),  which  we  heard  on  April  28,  2021 \n[Exhibit C].    This  bill  provides  that,  in  addition  to  the  current  requirement  to  conduct \nbackground checks on current employees, public or private institutions and agencies to which \na juvenile court commits a child and certain facilities that provide residential mental health \ntreatment to children must conduct background checks of applicants for employment to \ndetermine whether a potential employee has charges pending against him or her or has been \nconvicted of several specified crimes.  The bill revises and standardizes the specified crimes \nfor which such institutions and agencies are required or authorized to deny an application for \nemployment or to terminate employment of a current employee. \n \nAn institution or agency may waive the prohibition on hiring an applicant who has been \nconvicted of a specified crime if the agency adopts and applies an objective weighing test \nwhereby certain mitigating factors are considered.  An agency may not waive the prohibition \nagainst hiring an applicant who has been convicted of a specified crime without applying the \ntest, and an agency decision is not appealable.  A review of relevant data must be conducted \nevery two years to determine the efficacy of the test and identify implicit bias, and applicants \nand  employees  are  allowed  to  correct  information  that  they  believe  has  been  reported \nincorrectly.  There are no amendments. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any questions from Committee members?  Seeing none, I will take a motion to \ndo pass. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN BENITEZ-THOMPSON MADE A MOTION TO DO \nPASS SENATE BILL 21 (1ST REPRINT). \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE  MOTION  PASSED.    (ASSEMBLYMEN  BLACK,  HAFEN, \nKRASNER, MATTHEWS, AND TITUS VOTED NO.) \n \nI will assign the floor statement to Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong. \n \nThe next bill on our work session is Senate Bill 146 (1st Reprint). \n \nSenate Bill 146 (1st Reprint):  Revises provisions relating to mental health services for \nchildren. (BDR 39-870) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \nSenate Bill 146 (1st Reprint) was heard on April 28, 2021 [Exhibit D].  This bill revises laws \nrelated to behavioral health care for children with emotional disturbance who are subject to \nthe jurisdiction of a juvenile court for reasons relating to protection from abuse and neglect.  \nSpecifically,  when  such  a  child  is  admitted  to  a  public  or  private  inpatient  psychiatric \ntreatment facility, the bill requires the administrative officer or staff of the facility to ask the \nperson or entity with legal custody of the child whether he or she has a health care provider \nwho regularly provides mental or behavioral health care.  If the child has such a provider, \nstaff of the facility must make a reasonable effort to consult with the provider concerning the \nchild's admittance and care and to coordinate on a plan to discharge the child from the \nfacility.  There were no amendments. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nMembers of the Committee, do we have any questions?  Seeing none, I would entertain \na motion to do pass. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  PETERS  MADE  A  MOTION  TO  DO  PASS \nSENATE BILL 146 (1ST REPRINT). \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN TITUS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \nI will assign that floor statement to Assemblywoman Titus. \n \nNext, we will move to Senate Bill 156 (1st Reprint). \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nSenate Bill 156 (1st Reprint):  Revises provisions relating to crisis stabilization centers. \n(BDR 40-488) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \nWe heard Senate Bill 156 (1st Reprint) on April 23, 2021 [Exhibit E].  The bill expands the \nauthority of the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and \nHuman Services (DHHS) to issue an endorsement as a crisis stabilization center not just to \na psychiatric hospital, but to any licensed hospital that meets certain requirements.  The bill \nalso expands the list of organizations by which a hospital may be accredited to qualify for \nrenewal of an endorsement, and it exempts rural hospitals from the accreditation requirement. \n \nAdditionally, the bill expands the existing requirement that DHHS take any action necessary \nto  ensure  crisis  stabilization  services  provided  at  a  psychiatric  hospital  with  a  crisis \nstabilization center endorsement are reimbursable under Medicaid to include such services \nprovided at any hospital with this endorsement. \n \nFinally, the bill makes conforming changes to existing law requiring health maintenance \norganizations or managed care organizations that provide services through Medicaid or the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program to negotiate in good faith to include a hospital with an \nendorsement  as  a  crisis  stabilization  center  in  their  provider  network.    There  were  no \namendments.  \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any questions from Committee members?  Seeing none, I would take a motion to \ndo pass. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  PETERS  MADE  A  MOTION  TO  DO  PASS \nSENATE BILL 156 (1ST REPRINT). \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN GORELOW SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nDo we have any comments on the motion? \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI am going to vote this out of Committee with the right to change my vote. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI will remind all Committee members that you always have the right to change your vote.  \nI appreciate that all Committee members have been very diligent about letting me know if \nthey do plan on doing that.  Are there any other comments on the motion?  [There were \nnone.] \n \nTHE MOTION PASSED.  (ASSEMBLYMEN BLACK AND MATTHEWS \nVOTED NO.) \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nI will give the floor statement to Assemblyman Orentlicher. \n \nWe will go next to Senate Bill 251 (1st Reprint). \n \nSenate Bill 251 (1st Reprint):  Revises provisions relating to genetic counseling and \ntesting. (BDR 40-478) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \nWe heard Senate Bill 251 (1st Reprint) on April 23, 2021 [Exhibit F].  This bill requires \nprimary care providers to attempt to determine whether adult women to whom they provide \nservices have a personal or family history of certain cancers or meet other criteria for which \nthe  United States  Preventive  Services  Task  Force  recommends  screening  for  a  harmful \nmutation of the BRCA [Breast Cancer] gene.  If certain criteria are  met, primary care \nproviders must screen for the mutation, provide written notice of the need to discuss genetic \ncounseling  and  testing,  provide  genetic  counseling,  and,  if  clinically  indicated,  provide \ngenetic testing. \n \nIn addition, the bill requires a notice to be sent with the results of a mammogram advising \nwomen who have a familial history of certain types of cancer to speak with their doctor about \ngenetic counseling and testing.  \n \nPhysicians, physician assistants, and advanced practice registered nurses may receive credit \ntoward applicable continuing education requirements  for completing a course related to \ngenetic counseling and genetic testing.  \n \nFinally, certain public and private health plans must cover screening, genetic counseling, and \ntesting for harmful BRCA gene mutations where such services are required as set forth in the \nbill.  The Commissioner of Insurance of the Division of Insurance of the Department of \nBusiness and Industry may take various actions, including suspending or revoking a health \ninsurer's  certificate,  for  failure  to  comply  with  these  requirements.    There  were  no \namendments. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nMembers of the Committee, are there any questions regarding S.B. 251 (R1)?  Seeing none, \nat this time I would entertain a motion to do pass. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  GORELOW  MADE  A  MOTION  TO  DO  PASS \nSENATE BILL 251 (1ST REPRINT). \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN TITUS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nDo we have any comments on the motion? \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nFor the record, while I applaud the intent of this bill, there is one provision I think is \nproblematic—the  one  granting  protection  from  professional  discipline  for  a  physician.  \nI think  that  is  a  bad  precedent  to  create—to  excuse  physicians  from  their  professional \nresponsibilities to patients—so I will be voting no. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any other comments regarding S.B. 251 (R1)?  [There were none.] \n \nTHE  MOTION  PASSED.    (ASSEMBLYMAN  ORENTLICHER  VOTED \nNO.) \n \nI will assign that floor statement to Assemblywoman Black. \n \nNext, we will move to Senate Bill 309 (1st Reprint).  \n \nSenate Bill 309 (1st Reprint):  Establishes a reinvestment advisory committee in certain \nlarger counties. (BDR 38-956) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \nWe heard Senate  Bill 309 (1st Reprint) on April 26, 2021 [Exhibit G].  It establishes \na reinvestment advisory committee in each county of the state with a population of 700,000 \nor more, which is currently Clark County.  The bill outlines membership of the committee \nand prescribes the duties of a reinvestment advisory committee, which include: \n \n•  Reviewing reports from the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the \nDepartment  of  Health  and  Human  Services  and  Medicaid  managed  care \norganizations (MCOs) regarding reinvestment of funds in the communities they \nserve; \n \n•  Reporting to the Division and MCOs about local initiatives to address homelessness, \nhousing issues, and social determinants of health; \n \n•  Making  recommendations  regarding  the  use  of  funds  by  MCOs  to  develop \ninnovative partnerships with community development organizations and providers \nof housing services and to support certain local government initiatives; and \n \n•  Compiling an annual report on these issues and the committee's activities. \n \nThere were no amendments. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any questions regarding S.B. 309 (R1)?  Seeing none, I will entertain a motion to \ndo pass at this time. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  PETERS  MADE  A  MOTION  TO  DO  PASS \nSENATE BILL 309 (1ST REPRINT). \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  SUMMERS-ARMSTRONG  SECONDED  THE \nMOTION. \n \nDo we have any comments on the motion?  [There were none.] \n \nTHE  MOTION  PASSED.    (ASSEMBLYMEN  BLACK,  HAFEN, \nKRASNER, MATTHEWS, AND TITUS VOTED NO.) \n \nI will assign that floor statement to Assemblywoman Gorelow. \n \nNext on our work session, I will move to Senate Bill 364. \n \nSenate Bill 364:  Revises provisions relating to emergency medical care for a victim of \nsexual assault or attempted sexual assault. (BDR 40-1004) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \nSenate Bill 364 was heard in this Committee on April 21, 2021 [Exhibit H].  This bill \nrequires the State Board of Health to adopt regulations requiring a hospital or independent \ncenter for emergency medical care to provide certain training to employees who provide care \nto victims of sexual assault or attempted sexual assault.  These facilities must inform victims \nof  their  right  to  receive  emergency  contraception  and  provide  such  contraception  upon \nrequest.  Failure to comply with the bill's requirements may result in disciplinary action for \nthese facilities, including administrative sanctions or the denial, suspension, or revocation of \na license.  There were no amendments. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nMembers of the Committee, are there any questions regarding S.B. 364?  Seeing none, at this \ntime I would entertain a motion to do pass. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  PETERS  MADE  A  MOTION  TO  DO  PASS \nSENATE BILL 364. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN TITUS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nDo we have any comments on the motion? \n \nAssemblyman Matthews: \nI will be voting yes today but will be reserving my right on the floor. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any other comments from members?  [There were none.] \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nTHE MOTION PASSED.  (ASSEMBLYWOMAN BLACK VOTED NO.) \n \nI will assign that floor statement to Assemblywoman Krasner. \n \nNext on the work session is Senate Bill 376 (1st Reprint). \n \nSenate Bill 376 (1st Reprint):  Revises provisions relating to child welfare. (BDR 38-503) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \nSenate Bill 376 (1st Reprint) was heard on April 28, 2021 [Exhibit I].  The bill requires child \nwelfare agencies to assign one of the following dispositions to a report concerning the \npossible abuse or neglect of a child upon determining that an investigation is not warranted \nor upon the conclusion of an investigation: \n \n•  Substantiated; \n•  Unsubstantiated; \n•  Unable to locate or contact; or \n•  Administrative closure. \n \nIn addition, S.B. 376 (R1) prohibits the reporting of dispositions other than substantiated to \nthe Statewide Central Registry for the Collection of Information Concerning the Abuse or \nNeglect  of  a  Child  and  prohibits  the  release  of  information  from  the  Central  Registry \nregarding  reports  of  child  abuse  or  neglect  that  received  a  disposition  other  than \nsubstantiated, except to a child welfare agency.  There were no amendments. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any questions from Committee members regarding S.B. 376 (R1)?  Seeing none, \nat this time I will take a motion to do pass. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  KRASNER  MADE  A  MOTION  TO  DO  PASS \nSENATE BILL 376 (1ST REPRINT). \n \nASSEMBLWOMAN PETERS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nDo we have any comments on the motion at this time?  [There were none.] \n \nTHE MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \nI will assign that floor statement to Assemblywoman Thomas. \n \nLast on our work session is Senate Bill 398. \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nSenate Bill 398:  Revises provisions relating to the Legislative Committee on Child \nWelfare and Juvenile Justice. (BDR S-507) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \nWe heard Senate Bill 398 on April 21, 2021 [Exhibit J].  The bill requires the Juvenile \nJustice Oversight Commission to submit a report to the Legislative Committee on Child \nWelfare and Juvenile Justice by August 1, 2022, containing an update on the progress made \nby the Division of Child and Family Services of the Department of Health and Human \nServices  in  implementing  its  current  5-year  plan  as  well  as  any  recommendations  for \nlegislation relating to improvements to the upcoming 5-year plan, any disparities in the \njuvenile justice system related to race or ethnicity, and compliance with the federal Juvenile \nJustice  and  Delinquency  Prevention  Act,  34  U.S.C.  §§  11101  et  seq.    There  were  no \namendments. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nMembers of the Committee, are there any questions regarding S.B. 398?  Seeing none, \nI would entertain a motion to do pass S.B. 398. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  PETERS  MADE  A  MOTION  TO  DO  PASS \nSENATE BILL 398. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN KRASNER SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nDo we have any comments on the motion?  [There were none.] \n \nTHE MOTION PASSED.  (ASSEMBLYMEN BLACK AND MATTHEWS \nVOTED NO.) \n \nI will assign that floor statement to Assemblywoman Krasner. \n \nThat concludes our work session.  We do have three bill hearings, and I am going to take \nthem slightly out of the order as they are listed on the agenda.  At this time, I will open the \nbill hearing on Senate Bill 379 (1st Reprint).  Welcome to the Committee, Senator Hardy.  \nPlease begin when you are ready. \n \nSenate Bill 379 (1st Reprint):  Provides for the collection of certain data concerning \nproviders of health care. (BDR 40-457) \n \nSenator Joseph (Joe) P. Hardy, Senate District No. 12: \nSenate Bill 379 (1st Reprint) is interested in data, and we need data in order to figure out how \nwe sit presently and how we want to get more practitioners and providers.  The bill is pretty \nsimple  in  its  organization.    We  want  to  attract  more  providers—especially  for  the \nunderrepresented groups and specialties.  The mechanics would work like this:  After you \nhave initially been licensed or certified, when you go for renewal, there will be a survey \nsent—hopefully  electronically—and  the  practitioner/provider  will  fill  out  the  survey.  \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nThe survey is interested in things that will tell us where that practitioner/provider is at.  That \nis on page 3, lines 3 through 32.  All those items are what we are interested in so we can \nfigure out how we can improve our delivery of health care and be able to make our people \nhealthier.  The working group that will be set up under the direction of the director of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services will meet.  They have to create a questionnaire, \nand they will do that.  The goal is on page 4, line 18, \"Attract more persons, including, \nwithout limitation, members of underrepresented groups,\" et cetera, and then on line 22, \n\"Improve health outcomes and public health in this State.\" \n \nThe survey response cannot be used to disqualify someone from approval of their license.  \nIt is confidential.  The survey will include doctors of every kind, nurses, mental health \nproviders,  chiropractors,  oriental  medicine,  podiatrists,  marriage  and  family  counselors, \nsociologists, psychologists, and alcohol, drug, and gambling counselors. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there questions from the Committee? \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI have some concerns and questions regarding the questions on this questionnaire and what \nthe ultimate purpose is.  Section 5, subsection 1, paragraph (b), mentions race and ethnicity, \nand paragraph (l) mentions future plans.  How is that relevant to somebody's qualifications \nwhen they renew their license? \n \nSenator Hardy: \nThis survey has nothing to do with the licensing of the person as much as it has to do with \nwho they are and what they are doing.  The confidentiality is really crucial, because if there \nis a physician or practitioner who is planning on going somewhere else, we do not want that \nperson to be identifiable; therefore, the confidentiality will be of utmost importance.  It is \ndesigned to be upon renewal, so there will not be an issue of, Well, I think you kept me out \nbecause of, which we are not supposed to be able to do.   \n \nDr. John Packham is on Zoom, and he can probably answer questions about the mechanics of \nthe questionnaire.  I will note that where I am coming from—an old white male—I may not \nbe as trustworthy or trusted in some communities as in others.  If I do not have people who \nlook like other people, then they may not trust those people, so I am very interested in getting \nand recruiting people who are, for lack of a better word, a BIPOC [Black, Indigenous, People \nof Color] community member for instance, and having that opportunity to grow the trust \nfactor in the medical and counseling world of Nevada. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI appreciate that answer and that is one of my concerns—that it may be used to, perhaps, not \nhire somebody or focus on how someone identifies.  What if they do not want to answer this?  \nWould that lead to denial of their licensure? \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nSenator Hardy: \nNo, it is not mandatory. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nIt is going to be an elective option.  You can opt in? \n \nSenator Hardy: \nCorrect.  It will have nothing to do with your license being allowed to continue.  It is not \nbefore you get licensed; it is upon renewal, so it will not have an effect on your hiring or \nfiring.  It will be confidential. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThat is reassuring if it is optional—which is a good thing.  Then it will be used statewide \nmaybe to identify some priorities and certain recruitment.  I guess Dr. Packham will have to \nanswer how this will help us change how we see it.  In my mind, to solve some of these \nproblems we need to make sure we encourage people from every background to go into the \nfields where we need them.  In health care, as you pointed out, it is critical that you have \nconfidence in your provider.  It helps if your provider understands your background or can \nidentify with you and you can identify with them; I understand that component, but I am not \nsure this questionnaire gets us there because it is on the back end already.  That is where \nI need some reassurance that it is going to help us get that right mix. \n \nJohn Packham, Associate Dean, Office of Statewide Initiatives, University of Nevada, \nReno School of Medicine: \n[John Packham supplied a policy brief, Exhibit K, and a PowerPoint, Exhibit L.]  This bill \nprovides a wonderful, very efficient mechanism for collecting data not only on physicians \nand nurses, but on any health professional who is renewing their license in the state of \nNevada.  Our primary purpose for bringing the bill is to improve the data that is used to \nestablish and maintain HPSA [health professional shortage area] designation.  That is very \nimportant for a number of programs that are critical to bringing and keeping physicians and \nother health professionals in the state of Nevada.  In addition to that, the bill will improve the \ncollection of data to inform a wide range of where our health care needs are by profession. \n \nSenator Hardy: \nDr.  Packham,  could  you  make  sure  the  acronym  that  you  just  used—HPSA—is  well \nunderstood so we are all on the same page. \n \nJohn Packham: \nThe acronym HPSA stands for health professional shortage area.  There are three types of \nshortage areas or designations:  primary care, oral health or dental, and mental and behavioral \nhealth professionals.  These are critical for making Nevada providers and facilities eligible \nfor loan repayment and [unintelligible] reimbursement and so forth.  I would stress the \nurgency.  When we talk about access to care, access to care is affected by those designations,  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nand it is critical for us to get it right and to take advantage of those particular designations.  \nI would like to reemphasize this is not simply or purely a data collection bill.  It is a data \ncollection bill that will inform and improve access in our state. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nI have not met you before, Senator Hardy, but this is a wonderful introduction on an issue \nthat is very important in my community.  I would like to ask why your request does not \ninclude an exit survey, if that is at all possible.  Why do doctors leave?  Our family lost our \npediatrician.  He was our pediatrician from the time my two older sons were 7 or 8 years old \nall the way up to our youngest son who just turned 19.  He is a Black man; we grew up in the \nsame city—Oakland, California.  We had these things in common, and to have a man who \nlooked like my sons take care of them all their lives, to be able to speak to them and have \na relationship with them and our family made a huge difference in how they responded to \nhealth care and the instructions he gave them.  All of a sudden, he was gone, and I never \nfound out why.  I just lost my OB/GYN whom I had for 20 years—same thing.  Even as we \nare collecting data about why people re-up their licenses, if there would be any way you \ncould  find out  why  people  leave—because that  also  might  inform  about  why  we  have \nshortages here. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI would like to start with the mechanics concerning how we are going to collect this data.  \nIn section 5, subsection 2, it reads, \"The Director shall develop and make available . . .\" and \nthat would be the director of the Department of Health and Human Services.  The director \nshall develop and make available to each professional licensing board, and those licensing \nboards are listed in Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 629.031 paragraphs (a) through (bb).  \nIs there a way to collect this data electronically?  For the record, could you tell us how that \nwill be implemented?   \n \nJohn Packham: \nThere are a variety of ways that can be done technologically.  What the licensing boards \nwould like for us to consider or think about on this is, when you renew your license online, as \nyou proceed through that renewal process, there would be a link to click on that would take \nyou to the Department of Health and Human Services where you would complete a survey \nwe  would  have  available.    When  you  complete  that  survey,  you  would  return  back, \nprovide your credit card information, and renew your license with the state of Nevada.  The \nwhole idea is to make this as seamless as possible so that every two years—for most \nprofessions—when you renew your license, you are spending from five to eight minutes \nproviding very valuable information that the State and other agencies would use to inform \npolicy. \n \nThere is a document as an exhibit [Exhibit K].  It is a background paper put together by about \na dozen of us who have been working on this issue.  It provides some great examples of how \nother states have done this.  The beauty of this proposed piece of legislation is that we do not \nhave to reinvent the wheel.  There are a number of state models.  We received wonderful  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nadvice from both the National Conference of State Legislatures as well as from the National \nGovernors Association.  They have some tried-and-true models out there ready to roll if and \nwhen we proceed on this.  I am confident that this is worth the lift. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nAre all the boards in a place where they will be able to do this?  Conversations with different \nboards at different times indicate they are in different states of data technology.  I know one \nboard a few years back was still doing paper application renewals because the cost to go to \nan electronic version was going to be north of $30,000.  A couple of sessions back, we were \ntrying to figure out how to pool some of those tech needs among some of the smaller boards.  \nJust knowing this is a really big swath of boards—and for the legislative record—are all the \nboards going to be in a place where they will be able to dovetail into the system you are \ntalking about? \n \nJohn Packham: \nMy honest answer would be no, they will not all be in the same place.  By my count, there \nare 28 boards that license or regulate anywhere from 7 to 75 professions, and they are all \nover the map in terms of the software they use for licensure renewal.  Some still do pencil \nand paper, et cetera.  Again, I am hoping that the way this bill has been crafted or proposed is \none that is mindful of those differences and allows boards to implement this, phase this in as \nthey see fit, and with enough time to take into account those variations.  If you have seen \none licensing board, you have seen one licensing board. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI appreciate the honesty of that, because in looking at the end of the bill, I see we have \ndifferent  implementation  dates  for  different  sections.    It  looks  like  you  have  done  an \nassessment of the boards, so depending on where the boards are at, you are addressing \ndifferent implementation dates.  Is that why we are seeing different ones except for the \nboards that are already doing renewals and licensing electronically?  They can dovetail into \nthis sooner, and those still using paper will need to figure out a way to get to an electronic \nbase.  They have until July 1, 2022. \n \nJohn Packham: \nAnother thing I would point out is that the time in which health professionals renew their \nlicense varies from board to board.  Some are on a yearly basis and some are every other \nyear, I believe.  With the state Board of Medical Examiners, you renew your license every \ntwo years by June 30.  The way to think about this is that the data will not start rolling in \nimmediately.  It will be phased in over the next couple of years, but in two or three years, we \nwill begin to have some solid data on health professions and not just practice characteristics \nand sociodemographic characteristics.  If it is the pleasure of this Committee, we can address \nsome of the concerns raised in a previous question about retirement plans or the likelihood of \nleaving or exiting the profession and the state.  Those are important questions.  The point \nI want to make is the data capture will not be immediate but will be phased in based on the \nway each board collects that data and the timeline in which they collect that data. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nFor the boards that still need to address the tech issue, does this require them to figure out \nhow to get themselves to an electronic renewal, or would they stay with paper?  For instance, \nthere could be an insert notification in the renewal letter that says, go to this link and do this \nsurvey electronically, until they can afford the cost to do everything online and with all \nthe tech. \n \nJohn Packham: \nI think the answer to that is a qualified yes.  We need to be flexible in how this is going to be \nimplemented and rolled out.  Some states have a superagency overseeing licensing, so you \nare dealing with one type of software and one common way of renewing your license.  We \nare different.  Each board is different, and I think we will have to be flexible and patient in \nhow this is implemented given that variation. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nThat was my question on implementation, but I have another about the specific data being \ncollected.  For the record, in section 5, subsection 1, paragraph (f), the working hours and \nlocation, what are you looking for in that?  When a licensee goes to complete that, is that \ngoing to be a qualitative sentence or are you looking for a delineation of their hours? \n \nJohn Packham: \nLet me speak to the general intent of that.  I did a survey about ten years ago on registered \nnurses in the state.  One of the things I discovered in that survey is that about 15 percent or \n20 percent of those nurses worked in a county that was different from where they had their \nlicensure renewal mailed back to them.  While it is good to know how many licensed \nphysicians or nurses work in a particular county or part of the state, we really need to know \nwhere they are practicing—where they are working and the type of employer they are \nworking for.  Are they working in a hospital or clinic setting or in a public health agency?  \nThe intent of that type of question is to get a better sense—for example, with respect to \na health professional shortage area designation—of whether they are providing care in a \nmedically underserved area?  What percent of the patient panel of population is on Medicaid, \net cetera?  As we are trying to assess that, we are getting better information on actually where \nthey practice medical care as well as whether the person is providing patient care, because \na  number of physicians work in administrative or university settings.  This will give us a \nbetter  handle  on  exactly  where  care  is  being  provided,  how  much,  and  what  types  of \npopulations those professionals are serving. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nBecause the list under NRS 629.031 is so exhaustive, your intent would be that those \nprofessions that are listed who work in the health care field would take the survey.  If they \nwere not working in the health care field, there would not be the assumption that just because \ntheir licensing type is listed in here, they are necessarily working in the health care field.  \nThat is something you would ask first and foremost.  Some of them are more obvious, like \nphysicians, but some others may or may not be in the health care field—for instance, a social \nworker.  Some might be in child welfare and some might be in medical, so I guess you would \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nask this question first:  Are they in the health care field?  If they are, then you want to capture \nthis data because otherwise it would just be erroneous data you would be collecting from \npeople who are not in the medical field.   \n \nJohn Packham: \nOur idea would be to ask every health professional renewing their license, so we could get \nour arms around that.  For example, if we are getting data on physicians whose primary \nspecialty is family medicine, it is important to not only know what the universe of family \nmedicine physicians are in the state or in a given county, but from that, how many are \nactually  providing  patient  care.   How  many  have  an  active  license and  how  many  are \nworking full time, because we know that for every 100 physicians in family medicine, maybe \n80 percent or 85 percent are actually in direct patient care.  In that subset, some are working \nfull time, and some are working part time.  Again, as we try to get our arms around what the \ncapacity of the state is and where we may or may not have gaps in provider coverage, this \ntype of data will really inform that much better than anything we currently have.  I can tell \nyou how many family physicians are licensed in Clark County; I have no clue what the \nfull-time equivalent of that number is providing direct patient care or serving Medicaid \npatients or working in medically underserved areas, and so forth.  We need answers to those \nquestions. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI appreciate that.  You keep using the example of physicians, and this is why I am asking \nfor the record because that list refers to all of the healing arts.  You are not just looking for a \nsubset of the healing arts, you mean the entire list of everyone in NRS 629.031.  Since I got \na firm yes on that, I am thinking that, with some of the licensing types such as social \nworkers, it is anyone who is licensed by the Board of Examiners for Social Workers, but not \nall of them work in health care. Therefore, once you get the data, you will clean it up so that \nnot everyone who is working in child welfare or working in anything other than health care is \nrepresented as a part of a workforce that indeed they are not a part of. \n \nJohn Packham: \nCorrect.  We are interested in the state's primary care capacity, and that does not mean just \nfamily  medicine  or  internal  medicine  doctors.    It  also  means  getting  our  arms  around \nadvanced practice nurses and physician assistants who we know are critical to primary care \ncapacity in our state.  If your profession would have that kind of variation—how many \nare practicing, how many are providing patient care versus administrative work, and so \nforth—I think the answer to that question is, yes. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nThere are a couple of others like music therapists in there.  They may or may not be in a \nmedical setting.  There is another one, I think it is a sports trainer, who may or may not be in \na medical setting—there were just a couple I was not quite sure about.  I believe we should \nflesh out on the record what you were trying to scoop up and the scope of it, because it will \nbe a lot of people to these licensing boards.  My licensing board asks me about the county \nI work in, the kind of work I do, the institution I work for, and those kinds of things.  \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nFor some of the professions, a lot of this will not be new.  I am thinking about how I am \ngoing to answer a lot of these things, such as working hours and locations.  I might spend \npart of my time outpatient and part of my time inpatient.  I guess you would want to know \nhow many hours I am in the hospital versus how many hours I am at the office versus how \nmany hours I am spending in patient homes.  I would just report that.  I assume you will \ngive me a freeform box to report that as more of a qualitative response, as opposed to just a \ndrop-down box with numbers; then you will sort all that out. \n \nJohn Packham: \nThe way to think about that phrasing [unintelligible] we could capture that data are to be \ndetermined.  The standard methodology in this line of research is to phrase the question, \"In \na typical  work  week,  how  much  of  your  time  is  involved  with  direct  patient  care, \nadministrative work, et cetera?\"  I am hoping that the bill is not overly prescriptive on the \nwording of questions, questionnaires, and so forth.  Again, going back to the original plan A, \nfinding out how many providers—regardless of what field they are in—are providing direct \npatient care. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI want to remind Committee members that this is a bill that came out unanimously from \na work session from the interim Legislative Committee on Health Care.  There is an interim \ncommittee report available on the Nevada Electronic Legislative Information System that \nI would encourage our members to reach out and look at.  There is a work session document \nthat has some of this in the minutes from a discussion of this bill as well. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nThat is an important point.  I also think it is important to note that the legislative record we \ncreate in committee is the legislative record.  We do not have a precedent for referring to \ninterim committees and the work they do as legislative record.  It may be helpful for us, but \nthe only formal actions we take are when we are in session, so I always think it is helpful to \nask these kinds of questions for the record.  If you do not ask how it is going to get done, this \nis the only place where bodies, boards, the people who write regulations, can look back for \ndirection. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI do not disagree, and I am not discouraging questions and creating a legislative history.  \nI just wanted to make sure the Committee members knew that.  It was left out during the \nintroduction of the bill, and I know the interim committee wanted to make sure that was also \nincluded on the record in case people had some additional information they wanted to look \nat—those other discussions that occurred during the interim.  Again, I would encourage \nanyone to ask questions and create that legislative history, because I agree that we do need to \nhave the intent clearly on the record. \n \nDo we have any other questions from Committee members at this time?  Seeing none, we \nwill begin testimony in support of S.B. 379 (R1). \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nSenator Julia Ratti, Senate District No. 13: \nI was the vice chair of the interim Legislative Committee on Health Care.  It was chaired by \nAssemblywoman Lesley Cohen.  This particular item came forward specifically because of \nan experience with one of our federally qualified health care centers in Washoe County.  \nThey have been able to use one of the wonderful programs from the federal government to do \nloan repayments to some of the health care professionals.  Unfortunately, because Nevada \ndid not have sufficient data to be able to compete well, when the time came around to renew \nthat kind of program that helps us recruit health care providers, and specifically health care \nproviders to serve low-income and underserved populations, we did not have the data, we did \nnot compete well, and we lost that program.   \n \nI want to underscore that this is not just about collecting data but absolutely about collecting \nenough data to be able to compete well and to know where we need to invest our resources \nand energy, but also to be able to draw down some federal resources so we can recruit \nproviders, particularly into hard-to-serve communities. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIs there anyone else to testify in support of S.B. 379 (R1)? \n \nJoelle Gutman Dodson, Government Affairs Liaison, Washoe County Health District: \nWe wanted to thank Dr. Packham and Senator Hardy for staying the course with this bill \nthroughout the session.  We are really pleased with [unintelligible] this session.  As the good \ndoctor said, knowledge is power, and the more we know about where providers are and are \nnot, the better we can work to serve our communities.  We believe this will help health \noutcomes in Nevada and, therefore, improve the public health of Nevadans.  Thank you for \nallowing me to testify.  We urge your support. \n \nBradley Mayer, representing Southern Nevada Health District: \nI am echoing Joelle Gutman Dodson's comments, and we want to thank Dr. Packham and \nDr. Hardy for bringing this bill forward.  We think collecting this data can have a meaningful \nimpact on how we deliver health care in Nevada, so we urge your support of this bill. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe will go to our next caller in support.  [There was no one.]  At this time, I will begin \ntestimony in opposition to S.B. 379 (R1).  [There was none.]  Next, I will go to neutral.  \nIs there anyone to testify in neutral to S.B. 379 (R1)?  \n \nKyra  Morgan,  Chief  Biostatistician,  Division  of  Public  and  Behavioral  Health, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services: \nI wanted to provide a little bit of clarity on data collection.  The idea behind data collection is \nthat the survey would be created and maintained by the Department of Health and Human \nServices (DHHS), and my office would be involved in that process.  A simple web link to \nthat survey would be provided to the health professionals upon renewal of their licenses.   \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nThis is an important piece of clarity because it really would just require—from a technical \nperspective—the person renewing their license to have access to either a computer or a smart \nphone in order to be able to follow that link and complete the survey.   \n \nThere really is no technical requirement from the perspective of the survey distribution on \nbehalf of the boards with the exception of just making that link available to their members.  \nThe data would then be submitted via an individual following that link.  They would be taken \nto a page to complete the questionnaire, and the responses to those questions would be \ndirected back to DHHS without actually having to be received by the boards themselves.  \nI think  that  not  only  eliminates  a  lot  of  workload  from  the  perspective  of  a  technical \nrequirement of the boards, but also eliminates concern that those responses could be used in \nany  negative  way  in  regard  to  confidentiality  of  the  data.    I  wanted  to  make  those \nclarifications. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nMs. Morgan, will you please hold on for a minute.  I want to see if our Committee members \nhave any follow-up questions for you specifically.  Do we have any follow-up questions for \nMs. Morgan? \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nThe responsibility of the board would just be to make the link available to their licensees; \nthat is a good distinction because I was worried that our boards were going to have to stand \nup  an  electronic  web  base.    Some  are  moving  there,  but  some  are  not,  so  we  could \ninadvertently be causing some of the smaller boards to really get their tech in line, which \ntypically means more licensing fee increases.  Would that happen in the time frame this \nimplementation date was looking at?  As long as they provide the information to their \nlicensee, which could include a piece of paper—a notice—in their renewal notice, then the \nboard has met its obligation for this legislation. \n \nKyra Morgan: \nThat is correct.  The idea was that we would take the burden of maintaining the survey away \nfrom the licensing boards.  We would cover the technical aspect of that, and anyone with \naccess to a smart phone or computer would be able to follow that link and submit their data \ndirectly to DHHS. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nI am learning today that all the boards do not have full web capability, but would the link be \navailable somewhere on their websites even if they do not have the ability to have online \nrenewal?  I heard Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson speak about a piece of paper, but \noften people go to websites to look things up.  Is that possible, and will you be able to help \nthose boards maintain that link to make sure it is fresh and functional in addition to any \nphysical papers they might share with their board members? \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nKyra Morgan: \nSimilar to what Dr. Packham stated earlier, there are a number of ways we can accomplish \nthis.  I think the bill keeps it broad and does not prescribe exactly how it will be done, but \nabsolutely, yes.  Once the survey is created and a link is provisioned, that link could be \ndistributed via an email list, it could be printed in hard copy, or it could be posted on a \nwebsite; there are a number of ways that could be distributed.  From a technical perspective, \nhow that works is, as we update the survey, as long as we keep it at that link, maintenance as \nfar as where that link is stored is extremely minimal.  The short answer is yes, but we do not \nhave the exact details worked out.  There are a number of mechanisms we could utilize. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any other questions from Committee members?  Seeing none, let us continue \nwith additional testimony in neutral on S.B. 379 (R1). \n \nMargot Chappel, Deputy Administrator, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services: \nThis data is important to the HPSA designations that our office is responsible for periodically \nfor the Health Resources and Services Administration at the federal level, and it will greatly \nassist us in creating that data and reporting it more easily on a regular basis.    \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIs there anyone else on the line who wishes to testify in neutral?  [There was no one.]  With \nthat, I will turn this back over to Senator Hardy for any closing remarks. \n \nSenator Hardy: \nThis is a committee bill that came out of the interim, and Senator Ratti is really the one \nresponsible for it.  I do not want to claim any responsibility or any accolades, because all of \nthis was committee work. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWith that, I will close the hearing on S.B. 379 (R1).  Next, we will move to Senate Bill 391 \n(1st Reprint). \n \nSenate Bill 391 (1st Reprint):  Revises provisions relating to dentistry. (BDR 40-455) \n \nSenator Julia Ratti, Senate District No. 13: \nAs the vice chair of the interim Legislative Committee on Health Care, I am bringing forward \nto you another bill that passed out of that committee unanimously.  This bill has been through \nquite the journey.  Chair Cohen and I recognized at the beginning of the interim that Nevada \nhas significant struggles when it comes to oral health care.  The interim committee had voted \nto focus on a couple of areas, and we chose oral health as one of the areas it was appropriate \nfor us to focus on because of the significant negative outcomes in Nevada when it comes to \noral health care. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nI did not know that we have a State Dental Health Officer within the Department of Health \nand  Human  Services  (DHHS)  until  last  session,  so  we  went  to  our  State  Dental \nHealth Officer and asked her to help us with a survey of best practices across the nation when \nit comes to oral health and places where we could move the needle when it comes to oral \nhealth care.  Dr. Antonina Capurro did some phenomenal work.  She brought forward a \npackage of things we could consider, and we had a couple of good days of hearings on oral \nhealth during the interim.  Then there was the pandemic, so coming into this session, we \nknew  that  we  probably  would  not  have  very  much  success  with  anything  that  had  a \nsignificant  fiscal  note.    During  the  interim,  we  pared  that  list  back  significantly  and \neliminated most of the things that had fiscal notes, knowing this was not the time to be \nlooking at significant expansions of programs or services. \n \nWhat we were left with were two very important pieces where we could move the needle on \noral health care.  One is focusing on oral health professionals—the whole spectrum including \ndental hygienists, dental therapists, or dentists and their roles in response to an emergency.  \nOne  thing  we  have  learned  during  the  pandemic  is  that  we  have  this  whole  field  of \nprofessionals who could lean in; but when it comes to oral health, we have very little \ninfrastructure built in terms of an emergency management structure—very little training, very \nlittle identification of who is available and how they could be available—and that was \nsomething we needed to rectify.  That was the first piece.  The second is that our state and \nour Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) lag when it comes to the concept of teledentistry.  We \nhave done a lot of work in this legislative body over multiple sessions on telehealth, and \ntelehealth has certainly seen a dramatic expansion and acceleration of acceptance during the \npandemic, but we had not done a lot of work on teledentistry.  As a result, we wanted to \nupdate the statutes when it came to teledentistry.  Those are the two concepts that came out \nof the interim Legislative Committee on Health Care.  I am going to ask Dr. Capurro to walk \nthrough those sections, because most of it is her work that she helped support the committee \nto work through.   \n \nSince the interim, I have had a couple of conversations with Richard Whitley, the director of \nthe Department of Health and Human Services, about some of the challenges for recruiting \nthe state's own dental health workforce.  We have two staff in the state of Nevada who \nsupport dental health.  One is our State Dental Health Officer, and Dr. Antonina Capurro is \nthat person.  The other is a State Public Health Dental Hygienist who works for the state.  \nThey were structured very differently in statute than were their comparable peers.  For \nexample, the State Dental Health Officer was structured very differently than the Chief \nMedical Officer, specifically when it comes to licensing, so we addressed the licensing for \nthe State Dental Health Officer to make it more comparable to the Chief Medical Officer.  \nThen, specific to the State Public Health Dental Hygienist, there is a piece in state law that \nsays that if you work as the State Public Health Dental Hygienist, you cannot take any \noutside work.  That typically makes sense with our state employees.  We say if you are going \nto have a full-time job with the state, you probably should not be doing any outside work \nwith the exception that our State Public Health Dental Hygienist is a part-time position \nbecause we have not had the resources to fund it at a full-time level.  To recruit someone into \nthat position, we are basically saying that we would like to hire that person for a part-time job \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nbut the person is not allowed to do any other work to be able to pay the bills.  That is just \nimpractical on its face.  I will take you through the parts that are very specific to the oral \nhealth staff, and then I will ask Dr. Capurro to take you through the specific sections about \ntelehealth and emergency response in the oral health community. \n \nIf you look at Senate Bill 391 (1st Reprint), section 1 states that the State Dental Health \nOfficer is not required to be a licensed practitioner.  This is a position that is not sitting in \na clinic doing dental health work on most days, so that license is not necessarily appropriate.  \nThe person could be a licensed dental practitioner:  that is one option.  However, the bill \nallows for an alternate option which is that the person would have a master's degree in public \nhealth and have graduated from a dental health college approved by the Commission on \nDental Accreditation (CODA) of the American Dental Association.  The person would have \ncompleted a dental health education in a CODA-approved educational facility and would \nhave a master's in public health.  This would allow for recruitment of someone who might \nhave been working in academia for a while and no longer using their practitioner's license \nand not updating it.  It will allow for much greater ease of recruitment from out of state, so \nwhen a dental health officer would come here, they would be able to get this license that is \nspecifically created for our State Dental Health Officer.   \n \nSection 1.3 is the section that removes the prohibition on the dental hygienist from having \noutside work.  Again, that is now a part-time position, and I think it is only fair that that \nperson be allowed to have other outside work. \n \nSection 27.5 is the section that authorizes the Board of Dental Examiners of Nevada to issue \nthis limited license for the dentist and dental hygienist, as applicable.  Section 27.5 also \nprohibits the holder of a limited license from practicing dentistry or dental hygiene, as \napplicable, and section 39.5 requires that it be renewed annually.  Sections 39, 40, and 41 all \nmake the conforming changes.  I will pause there because those are the sections of the bill \nthat specifically relate to the licensing of the dental health professionals, and ask Dr. Capurro \nto go through the teledentistry and emergency response sections of the bill. \n \nAntonina C. Capurro, D.M.D., M.P.H., M.B.A., State Dental Health Officer, Division of \nPublic and Behavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services: \nI oversee the Nevada Oral Health Program within DHHS.  I am joined by Ms. Jessica \nWoods, our Interim State Public Health Dental Hygienist.  She will also provide additional \ndetails on this bill. \n \nI want to start with some background.  The landscape of health care is changing, as is our \nservice delivery model, so to adapt to these changes and implement lessons learned from the \ndental community's response to the pandemic, this bill has been created.  The components of \nthe bill are built on the foundation that oral health is critical to overall health for individuals \nof all ages.  Poor oral health can lead to pain and tooth loss that affects quality of life and can \nimpact employment. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nResearch  has  identified  an  association  between  poor  oral  health  and  chronic  disease \nconditions such as diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, and stroke.  However, in 2019 what \nwe saw was 35.3 percent of Nevada adults reported they had not visited a dentist or dental \nclinic within the last year, and 23 percent of Nevada adults responded that they experience \nanxiety due to conditions of their mouth and teeth.  We know that low-income adults, \nindividuals,  and  families,  as  well  as  racial and  ethnic minorities,  are  disproportionately \naffected by oral health problems, and the COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated these health \ncare inequities.  It has led to dental office closures to all but emergency services.  From \nMarch 16, 2020, to May 4, 2020, we had cancellation of school-based preventive touch \npoints.  There has also been a change in the dental workforce which we may not realize for \nseveral years.  Many of the lessons learned from providing dental care during the pandemic, \nincluding  the  expanded  use  of  teledentistry  and  inclusion  of  dental  professionals  as \nemergency responders, is addressed in this bill. \n \nSections 10 to 16 define the educational and training requirements that are needed for oral \nhealth professionals to respond to a public health disaster or any type of state of emergency.  \nIt also establishes the Committee on Dental Emergency Management.  These sections are \nbased on the concept that emergencies and disasters strain the state's health resources, and \nwithout a more robust disaster workforce, the lives and well-being of Nevadans are at risk.  \nDental practitioners who are well versed in emergency management are deployable health \ncare professionals during a public health crisis, terrorist threat, or natural disaster.  There are \nnumerous dental professionals who are technically trained to save lives, but who do not have \nthe specific types of training that would be necessary to step in during an emergency or \npublic health disaster.  This lack of training impairs the state's ability to respond quickly and \nefficiently  to  emergencies  and  disasters,  so  this  training  is  addressed  in  these  sections.  \nSection 17 adds a dental emergency responder to the Committee on Emergency Medical \nServices.  The last component in the bill is teledentistry. \n \nDuring  the  2020  stay-at-home  orders,  there  was  an  exponential  rise  in  the  number  of \nteledental visits.  In June 2019, there were roughly 102 teledental visits to Medicaid patients.  \nThat number grew to 934 in May 2020.  This increase occurred without a framework for safe \nand efficient utilization of teledentistry.  Sections 19 to 21 include a teledental exam that \nmeets certain criteria as an option to fulfill school entrance requirements.  Sections 22 to 27 \ndefine what teledentistry is, and sections 28 to 31 require a dental practitioner to follow \nclinical  requirements,  ethical  standards,  and  confidentiality  of  the  patient's  information \nduring a teledental visit.  It also outlines the practitioner-patient relationship and outlines it \nfor consent as well.  Sections 32 to 35 ensure communication complies with all Health \nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act laws, and the patient information is secure and \nencrypted.  Section 33 outlines when referrals should be made to ensure that there is adequate \nin-person care when it is needed.  Section 34 requires the Board of Dental Examiners of \nNevada to adopt regulations governing teledentistry, and sections 37 and 39 outline a one-\ntime teledentistry education course for dental practitioners. \n \nSection 1.7 and sections 42 to 45 create options for hospital systems in the state to leave the \nestablished network of dental professionals that are enrolled in the dental managed care \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \norganization to bring those teledental services to individuals who are having a real-time \ndental emergency at a hospital.  Sections 19 to 39 and sections 42 to 45 are the sections that \nestablish this framework for teledentistry to reduce those traditional barriers to care, to foster \nequality, and allow Nevada to leverage new technology that expands access to dental care for \nall patients in the state regardless of where they are located, a parity with in-person services, \npractitioner-patient  relationship,  informed  consent,  patient  record  requirements, \nconfidentiality of the information, and referrals and regulations to be created by the Board of \nDental Examiners are all outlined in these sections. \n \nSenator Ratti: \nI believe that is the entirety of our presentation, and we stand ready for questions. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank  you  for  bringing  this  bill  forward.    I  was  a  member  of  the  interim  Legislative \nCommittee on Health Care; however, we never see the bills actually written.  They are \ngenerally just concepts of what the priorities will be for a bill presentation, so I have a couple \nof questions on the bill.  Under section 1, subsection 1, paragraph (b), subparagraphs (1) and \n(2), you are removing the requirement that they be a licensed dentist in the state, so at no \ntime can our dental health officer see patients, practice on anyone, give advice, or consult.  \nYou are removing from them their ability to practice, or will we ultimately require that they \nget a license in the state?  I understand that perhaps you might want to recruit someone who \nis not currently licensed in Nevada and there may be a delay—the individual might not have \na license at the time—but I am concerned that ultimately they may never need a license to \npractice in the state. \n \nSenator Ratti: \nSection 1 creates the alternative path to licensure, and that is where you see the word \"or.\"  \nRight now, it has to be someone with a current license to practice.  Section 1, subsection 1, \nparagraph  (b),  subparagraph  (2), creates  the alternate  pathway  which  is  the  master's  or \ndoctorate degree in public health or a related field and be a graduate of a dental college or \nresidency program accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation.  That is the \naccrediting body for educational institutions for oral health.  Then, if you will follow me to \npage 19 and section 27.5, this is the section which states, \"The Board shall, without a clinical \nexamination  required  .  .  .  issue  a  limited  license  to  a  person  to  practice  dentistry  or \ndental hygiene who:  (a) Has entered into a contract . . . to serve as the State Dental Health \nOfficer . . . or the State Public Health Dental Hygienist\" and satisfies the requirements of \nthose chapters of NRS and pays the fee.  Then the bill talks about the limited license—how \nyou get that license; the fee; and then on page 20 at line 21, the bill states: \n \n\"Shall  not,  for  the  duration  of  the  limited  license,  engage  in  the  private \npractice of dentistry or dental hygiene in this State or accept compensation for \nthe  practice  of  dentistry  or  dental  hygiene  in  this  State  except  such \ncompensation as may be paid to the person by the Division of Public and \nBehavioral Health . . . .\" \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \nYou see it there, and it is only within the scope of his or her appointment as the dental health \nofficer or the dental hygienist.  Section 27.5, subsection 6 is important.  It states, \"Not later \nthan 7 days after the termination of a contract . . . .\"  Now they are no longer an employee of \nthe state.  Subsection 6, paragraph (a) continues with, \"Provide to the Board written notice \nof the termination; and (b) Surrender his or her limited license to the Board.\" \n \nIf  they  were  interested  at  that  point  in  going  back  into  practicing  dentistry,  or  maybe \npracticing dentistry for the first time in the state of Nevada, they would have to apply for and \nobtain their license to practice.  It is the combination of section 1 and section 27.5 that lays \nout what the new path is and what the requirements of the new path are. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank you for that clarification.  I have another question.  In section 1.7 it reads that if a \nMedicaid  recipient  presents  to  the  emergency  room,  there  is  a  list  of  dental  providers \nthat must be given to them or displayed somewhere.  In my practice, we always made \nsure everyone—those  who  were  not  on  Medicaid,  those  who  were  uninsured  or \nunderinsured—had follow-up instructions and access to lists of providers we would refer \nthem to whether it was the ophthalmologist, the orthopedist, et cetera, including a dentist.  \nWhy are you singling out that the Medicaid recipient has to have this list and it has to be \nposted? \n \nSenator Ratti: \nI will turn that one over to Dr. Capurro.  There were many conversations with providers that \nresulted in some compromise language, and she had more involvement. \n \nAntonina Capurro: \nThis language specifically talks about Medicaid recipients because that is the patient pool \nthat we know services are provided for.  When they come in for a nontraumatic dental \nemergency right now—someone who is seen at the hospital—there is no definitive treatment \nthat is provided.  Providing teledental services to that group will ensure that they are able to \naccess real-time care and those services are provided under Medicaid.  That is why this \nlanguage  has  come  about,  so  there  is  some  type  of  information  when  in  the  hospital \nemergency room and they do not go from that emergency room back to the emergency room \nwhen  their  condition  flares  up  again.    Adults  in  the  state  have  dental  coverage  for \nemergencies, but we are trying to link them to a provider.  That is why this is more specific \nto the Medicaid patient, but I would hope that if the hospital had signage about teledental \nproviders or used teledentistry, any patient in the hospital would become aware of that and \nwould use the services. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI just want to make sure that the Medicaid patient is not seen as getting lesser care because \nthey are forced to use teledentistry, whereas another patient might be referred right to the \ndentist—an in-person visit.  I wanted to make sure there was parity there and not that a \nperson who is on Medicaid would have to use teledentistry.  I am always anxious when  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \na certain subset is provided one avenue and not everyone else is provided with that avenue, \nor the reverse.  I needed some clarity that, indeed, there is health care for all patients, and \nI am not seeing that. \n \n[Assemblywoman Peters assumed the Chair.] \n \nAntonina Capurro: \nWe are not trying to change what is provided in the hospital.  All patients would still have to \nbe triaged in the hospital; this is simply a referral mechanism to ensure that those patients \nwho have this Medicaid benefit are able to receive it.  It is a type of care coordination. \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nAre there other questions from the Committee? \n \nSenator Ratti: \nHaving served on many health committees with Assemblywoman Titus, I know where she is \ngoing with that line of questioning, and I would be happy to look into it a little bit further.  \nI will say that the origin of this is that we have set up a dental provider managed care \norganization within the state and we see underutilization.  For whatever reason, our Medicaid \npatients are not figuring out that they also have dental insurance.  I do not know if we see that \nsame problem for someone who has their own insurance and knows about their insurance, \nbut we are definitely seeing in the Medicaid market a significant underutilization of a service \nthat we are investing a significant amount of resources into.  This is really trying to get at that \nunderutilization of our Medicaid dental health benefits, but I am happy to take a look at it and \nsee if we need to expand the language to read that anybody who has a dental emergency \nshould get this list.  I think that will happen naturally, but that is the genesis of this if that is \nhelpful for context. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank you, Senator Ratti.  That is much appreciated. \n \n[Assemblywoman Nguyen reassumed the Chair.] \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe will go next to Assemblywoman Thomas. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nMy question concerns clarity or understanding.  In section 13, subsection 5, it reads: \n \nA dental responder may not be held civilly or criminally liable for any act or \nomission  performed  while  providing  or  supervising  the  provisions  of \nemergency medical care, immunizations, medical care in a mobile clinic or \nhumanitarian care in accordance with this section and the regulations adopted \npursuant  thereto  unless  the  act  or  omission:  (a),  Amounts  to  willful \nmisconduct or gross negligence.   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 27 \n \nWho determines what is willful misconduct or gross negligence?  I am not seeing where the \npatient who is under the care of a dental responder has the ability to tell authorities that they \nfeel like there was misconduct or negligence. \n \nSenator Ratti: \nI  feel  relatively  confident  that  this  is  the  boilerplate  language  that  is  in  place  for  all \nemergency  response,  so  it acknowledges  that  in an  emergency response  sometimes  our \nproviders  are  going  to  need  to  take  emergency  action.    We  try  to  give  them  some \nprotection—a limited protection—from liability if they are operating within the scope of their \nlicense to provide assistance to somebody in an emergency.  That is the first premise.  \nSpecifically getting down to the exceptions to that—and these are very important exceptions, \nso this is not a get-out-of-civil-court or get-out-of-criminal-court-free card.  It does not \namount to that at all because if there has been willful misconduct or gross negligence, or they \nwere under the influence, you lose that liability protection. \n \nAt the end of the day, the decider will be the judge, right?  Really, this is about if there were \na criminal charge filed or if there were a civil complaint, so if that patient perceived he or she \nhad been harmed, the remedy would be to file a civil complaint.  A judge would look at that \ncivil complaint.  The judge's starting point would be that there is some limited immunity here \nbecause it was an emergency, unless they were under the influence or it meets the standard of \nwillful misconduct or gross negligence—which are legally defined terms that courts are \naccustomed to working with.  This is really all about that system—the court system—and the \njudge would be the person who would decide. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nMs. O'Krent is on the Zoom now, and I will turn it over to her to confirm what you just \nmentioned. \n \nKarly O'Krent, Committee Counsel: \nThat is absolutely correct.  It would be up to the court to make a determination regarding \nwhether willful misconduct occurred, and \"willful\" is defined in Black's Law Dictionary to \nhave a particular meaning, so that would be interpreted by the court at that time. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nTo me, it looks like that patient does not have the ability to seek restitution, but it might be \njust the way it is worded here.  That is my opinion. \n \nSenator Ratti: \nI appreciate the clarification and the perception.  It is relatively standard language we have in \nall our emergency responses.  It is not my intent to remove a patient's right to seek remedy.  \nThey absolutely have that right to seek remedy; however, they would only achieve that \nremedy if there was willful misconduct or gross negligence or someone was under the \ninfluence.  That would be the way to think about it; and thank you for the comment. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 28 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAssemblywoman Thomas, do you have any follow-up questions? \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nNo, but I appreciate it. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any other questions from Committee members? \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nIf memory serves, we had a bill yesterday in the Assembly Judiciary Committee that talked \nabout  removing  the  dental  board—consolidating  some  of  the  boards.    That  was  really \nsurprising, so I texted my dentist and asked if he knew anything about it.  How would this \nbookend into that? \n \nSenator Ratti: \nI am not in a position to answer that question because it was not my bill and I have not sat on \nthe committees that heard that bill, so I cannot claim to be familiar with it in a detailed way.  \nLegal counsel might want to chime in and explain what happens if two bills pass that are in \nconflict with each other.  We certainly have lots of statutes that call out the licensing boards, \nand if there is a change to the licensing boards, my assumption would be that all the other \nstatutes would have to conform to that. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nMs. O'Krent, is there any clarification you can give to Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong \nat this time, or do you need additional time to research those two bills? \n \nKarly O'Krent: \nI would need some additional time to research the specifics of that bill, but Senator Ratti is \ncorrect.  In the event a bill passes and is enrolled that conflicts with another bill, our office \nhas a review process whereby we ensure that subjects of conflict are not passed without \nbeing addressed during the legislative session. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there further questions? \n \nAssemblywoman Krasner: \nI am looking at sections 19, 20, and 21 that talk about teledentistry and dental homes and \nvirtual dental homes.  Section 19 talks about public schools, private schools, and child care \nfacilities that require children to receive dental examinations.  Then it says that the \"dental \nhome,\" which is a group of people including a dentist, can have a virtual dental home.  It just \nhas to be a dentist licensed in Nevada.  I am wondering if it can be a dentist who is licensed \nin Nevada but living and practicing in, say, Florida or some other state or country? \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 29 \n \nSenator Ratti: \nThank you for the question, but I will turn that one over to Dr. Capurro.  We have learned \na lot about telehealth generally and what works well, but I will turn the details on that one \nover to her. \n \nAntonina Capurro: \nIt is specified in section 28 that a person who provides teledentistry would need to be \nlicensed in this state, so they would need to be licensed in Nevada.  What I have seen in other \nstates that have a virtual dental home model is more for a patient who might be living in \na rural  community  where  there  is  not  a  dentist  nearby.    They  are  receiving  care  via \nteledentistry with the licensed provider in the state they are living in.  There is also language \nregarding  informed  consent  that  determines  that  a  patient  is  in  the  state  the  dentist  is \npracticing in. \n \nAssemblywoman Krasner: \nBecause they can have a virtual home, I think dentists can be licensed to practice in more \nthan one state, is that correct?  If that is true, could the dentist be licensed in, say, Nevada and \nFlorida both, and have a virtual home in Nevada where the dentist does teledental exams on \nthe children, but they are physically located in a different state?  Is that possible with \nthis bill? \n \nAntonina Capurro: \nIf the provider is licensed in multiple states but is also licensed in Nevada and following \nNevada's statutes and laws, then that would technically be possible.  The provider would also \nneed to provide referrals, and that is also outlined in the bill.  If the patient needed care that \nthe dentist could not provide through teledentistry, they have to be aware of the surrounding \nprovider network and refer the patient to care.  Therefore, the child would not be without \na referral network if that was the case. \n \nJessica Woods, R.D.H., M.P.H., Interim State Public Health Dental Hygienist, Division \nof Public and Behavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services: \nI have worked in this model before, so one thing that might be helpful is to think of us like \na hub-and-spoke model where the dentist may be in one location but other members of the \ndental team—like a dental hygienist or dental therapist—would be out in a rural community \ncollaborating with that dentist.  Often, the dental hygienist or the dental therapist will be \ncollecting some sort of information such as X-rays or intraoral pictures and sending them \nback to a dentist who is not actually in that community—maybe not even in the state—but \ngiving the direction to a provider who is actually located there.  This language would allow \nfor that. \n \nSenator Ratti: \nIt does end up becoming critically important for a state like Nevada that has so many \ncommunities right on the border.  In some of our eastern Nevada communities, a big chunk \nof their care might come from Salt Lake City, Utah.  In our southern Nevada communities,  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 30 \n \na good chunk of their care might come from across the border in Arizona, or right here where \nwe have some good relationships with our California providers.  Yes, the model is intended.  \nThere is nothing in the bill that prohibits that virtual home from being outside the state. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nSeeing no more questions at this time, we will begin testimony in support of S.B. 391 (R1). \n \nEdward Ableser, representing Nevada Dental Association: \nThank you for hearing the bill and the testimony as provided by Senator Ratti.  We want to \nextend our appreciation to Senator Ratti for sponsoring and bringing the bill out of the \ninterim, and for the hard work that was done in the interim on this topic.  Also, thank you to \nDr. Capurro for her efforts in bringing these much-needed pieces of policy before you.  We \nask for your full support on the bill, on behalf of the dentists throughout the state of Nevada.  \nThank you for hearing this, and we appreciate your time. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIs there anyone else in the room or on Zoom who would like to testify in support?  [There \nwas no one.]  Are there any callers waiting to testify in support?  [There were none.]   \n \n[Exhibit M, Exhibit N, and Exhibit O, letters in support, were submitted but not discussed \nand will become part of the record.] \n \nAt this time, I will open testimony in opposition.  Is there anyone in the room or on Zoom \nwho would like to testify in opposition?  [There was no one.]  Are there any callers waiting \nto testify in opposition?   \n \nVilas Sastry, Chief Executive Officer, TeleDentistry.com: \nI was trying to figure out the navigation of the mute and unmute.  I am in support of this bill.  \nI want to say thank you to all the members on the call as well as to Senator Ratti and \nDr. Antonina Capurro for putting together this legislation and want to offer my full support \nfor it. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nPeople occasionally have technical difficulties.  We will classify that testimony as support.  \nDo we have anyone in opposition? \n \nFelipe M. Paleracio, D.D.S., President, Las Vegas Dental Association: \nI am a licensed practicing dentist in Nevada and, at the same time, president of the Las Vegas \nDental Association.  I am here to oppose S.B. 391 (R1).  The State Dental Health Officer \nneeds to be a qualified Nevada-licensed dentist.  The State Dental Health Officer needs to \nhave passed [unintelligible] to be able to understand the oral health needs of Nevadans.  The \npublic citizens of Nevada are not protected when the State Dental Health Officer is not \ncapable to diagnose patients and has not been trained clinically to examine patients.  The \ncurrent State Dental Health Officer, Antonina Capurro, earned over $200,000 last year in her  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 31 \n \nposition.  The current State Dental Health Officer, Antonina Capurro, is under investigation \nfor the illegal practice of dentistry and violating the terms of her license which was based on \nthe condition that she would not then practice dentistry.  \n \nSenate Bill 391 (1st Reprint) proposes to change the law that the State Dental Health Officer \ndoes not need to be a Nevada-licensed dentist, thus allowing Antonina Capurro to keep her \nvery highly paid job earning over $200,000 per year, and then forcing the dental board to  \ngive her a dental license.  Senate Bill 391 (1st Reprint) changes the law that the State Public \nHealth Dental Hygienist should be allowed to work outside of her state position.  The current \ninterim State Public Health Dental Hygienist is already working outside of her position, thus \npossibly violating current state law.  Why would a Nevada legislator who is responsible for \nprotecting  the  citizens  of  Nevada  propose  S.B.  391  (R1)  to  have  an  unlicensed  and \nunqualified individual be the State Dental Health Officer?  It seems to me that this bill has \nbeen designed in order to protect someone.  For the record, I am a long-time Medicaid \nprovider, and there are a lot of problems we encounter, and I would be glad to testify during \n[unintelligible] if there is a need, and I would like to discuss the [unintelligible] dental care \nand the Medicaid Program.  [Unintelligible.] \n \nChair Nguyen: \nCould we go to our next caller in opposition?  [There was no one.]  \n \n[Exhibit P, letters in opposition, was submitted but not discussed and will become part of the \nrecord.] \n \nNow, I will go to any neutral testimony.   \n \nCody L. Phinney, M.P.H., Deputy Administrator, Division of Health Care Financing \nand Policy, Department of Health and Human Services: \nI would like to go on the record as saying that Dr. Capurro's help for the Nevada Medicaid \nServices program has been greatly appreciated.  Having that clinical experience for our \npolicy development has been a great boon to us in trying to improve our dental policy and \ndental programming, and we appreciate the help. \n \nVilas Sastry: \nI want to speak in support of Dr. Capurro and everything she did last year. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe have already heard your testimony on this bill in support and reclassified it.  If you have \nany additional comments, I encourage you to wait until public comment. \n \nIs there anyone else in neutral?  [There was no one.]  With that, Senator Ratti, would you like \nto make any closing remarks? \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 32 \n \nSenator Ratti: \nI want to let the Committee know that no one has contacted me with any concerns about the \nbill directly or asked for any conversation or changes to the bill.  Sitting here in today's \nhearing was my first knowledge that there were any concerns—none of this came up in the \nSenate. \n \nI would also like to note that the changes in the bill with regard to the current health staff are \nneutral and not intended to be specific to any one individual.  They came about because of a \nconversation I had with the director of DHHS about the challenges for these particular \npositions.  Again, the chief dental officer position is aligned very similarly to what we do \nwith the Chief Medical Officer, and I think there are some very legitimate reasons why we \nwould want to do that.  I am disappointed that anyone wants to make this about any one \nindividual or person and would like to give you my assurance as the chair that this is about \ngood policy and nothing more than that. \n \nI know there were some questions and concerns.  If there is anyone on the Committee \nlooking specifically for an amendment to this bill that would help you support it, I would ask \nyou to reach out to me.  We are getting to that point in the session where we are running out \nof time and there are some good things in this bill that really will help move the needle—be it \never so slightly—not as grandiosely or significantly as we had hoped during the interim—but \nit will make a difference, particularly on building that emergency responder workforce and \ngetting  some  clarity  in  our  statutes  around  teledentistry.    If  you  are  looking  for  some \namendments, please reach out to me; otherwise, I very much urge your support.  We need to \ndo more when it comes to oral health, and these are some good steps forward. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWith that, I will close the hearing on Senate Bill 391 (1st Reprint) and open the hearing on \nSenate Bill 329 (1st Reprint).    \n \nSenate Bill 329 (1st Reprint):  Revises provisions relating to competition in health care \nmarkets. (BDR 40-998) \n \nSenator Roberta Lange, Senate District No. 7: \nThank you for the opportunity to present Senate Bill 329 (1st Reprint) before you today.  \nThis  bill  aims  to  enhance  transparency  around  health  care  consolidation  and  limit \nanticompetitive contract practices between hospital systems and health insurers in Nevada.  \nAs  you  are  all  well  aware,  health  care  spending  is  high  in  Nevada  and  nationwide.  \nAccording to official estimates, total health care spending in the United States reached \n$3.8 trillion in 2019—a 4.6 percent increase from the previous year.  In fact, national health \ncare spending has been growing by 4 percent to 5 percent annually since 2014.   \n \nThe key factor that contributes to increased health care spending is market consolidation and \nhealth care providers and facilities.  According to a new report from the National Academy \nfor State Healthcare Policy, rapid consolidation in nearly every state has created dominant \nhealth care systems that use anticompetitive contract practices to charge super competitive \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 33 \n \nprices especially to commercial insurance plans.  The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to \nfurther accelerate this consolidation and, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a large \nbody of research demonstrates that provider consolidation leads to higher health care prices \nfor private insurance.  Studies also show that consolidation of health care facilities reduces \nhealth insurers' ability to keep prices low because they have less market power than the \nhospitals.  At the same time, these increased prices have little or no impact on quality of care, \nutilization rates, or efficiency. \n \nNevada currently does not have many tools to review or regulate consolidation in the health \ncare market.  We are a pretty high bar before mergers and acquisitions are reviewed by state \nagencies.  Certificate of need laws only apply to certain parts of the state.  We do not have \nany information about the impact of private equity in the health care markets, and nothing \nprohibits contracting practices that favor health care monopolies.   \n \nThis bill aims to address these problems by taking the first step to monitor consolidation \namong  health  care  facilities  and  limiting  anticompetitive  contracting  practices  between \nhospital systems and health insurance payors in Nevada.  Joining me to provide additional \ninformation regarding the real-world effect of these issues as well as to discuss the technical \ndetails of the bill and amendments are Stacie Sasso, Executive Director, Health Services \nCoalition; Maya Holmes, Healthcare Research Manager, Culinary Health Fund; Bobbette \nBond, Director of Public Policy, Culinary Health Fund; and Katherine Gudiksen, Senior \nHealth Policy Researcher, The Source on Healthcare Price and Competition.  Now, I will \nexchange seats with Chelsea Capurro, who will direct the questioning to the appropriate \nperson. \n \nChelsea Capurro, representing Health Services Coalition: \nWe will start with Stacie Sasso.   \n \nStacie Sasso, Executive Director, Health Services Coalition: \nWe want to thank Senator Lange for bringing this needed bill forward and working with \nus and  other  stakeholders  on  the  language  and  intent.    We  would  also  like  to  thank \nChair Nguyen, Vice Chair Peters, and the Committee members for their consideration of \nS.B. 329 (R1).  The Health Services Coalition represents 25 union- and employer-sponsored \nhealth plans in southern Nevada, including the MGM, Boyd Gaming, firefighters, Las Vegas \nMetropolitan  Police  Department,  and  unions  including  the  culinary,  electrical  workers, \nplumbers, and others.  The coalition's main focus is to bring affordable, quality health care to \nour estimated 300,000 covered lives.  It is the intent of our member groups to help our \nparticipants  become  good  stewards  of  their  health  care  dollars.    In  order  to  do  that, \ntransparency  is  key.    At  this  time,  I  would  like  to  turn  the  presentation  over  to \nBobbette Bond. \n \nBobbette Bond, Director of Public Policy, Culinary Health Fund: \n[Bobbette  Bond  presented  a  PowerPoint,  Exhibit  Q.]    The  Culinary  Health  Fund  is  a \nnonprofit health fund that provides comprehensive benefits for our 60,000 members and their \ndependents, so we cover about 125,000 lives.  The part of the coalition you just heard about \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 34 \n \nfrom  Ms.  Sasso  is  a  labor-management  partnership  that  includes  most  of  the  hotels, \ndowntown casinos, airport food services, and industrial laundries in Las Vegas.  Our priority \nis to ensure access to high-quality and affordable health care in Nevada.  For public and \nprivate payors and patients, health care dollars are precious and in limited supply, and you \nhave heard a lot about that this session, as you have other sessions. \n \nHealth care is a critical need, though, so we have to be effective stewards of those monies.  \nWe spend our time trying to find what the cost drivers are, where there is opportunity to \nimprove the system to reduce price, control price, and increase access and also educate our \nmembers and improve qualities.  That is the space we try to fill in this community. \n \nNationally there has been tremendous consolidation in the health care industry.  Hospital \nsystems  are  buying  out  hospital  systems,  private  equity  is  buying  up  doctor  groups—\nincluding here—and other health care entities are consolidating as well.  All the experts are \nsaying that this trend is going to continue and is exacerbated by COVID-19, so there will be \nmore industry consolidation moving forward.  In Nevada, we have a lot of private, for-profit \nhospital care already, and we do not know very much about how the industry is changing.  \nWe know it is happening; we know consolidation is happening in the markets because we see \nit in our claims and in our contracts.  We see it when we see that the hospital system has \nhired an emergency room (ER) group that now, instead of being owned by ER doctors in \nNevada, is owned by a private equity company.  We have had experience with this happening \nwith a couple of ER groups in Las Vegas.  There is no transparency about it for you, as \npolicy makers, or for us to really understand the trends.  Nevada is just behind on hospital \ntransparency and behind on health care transparency in general in trying to identify our \npolicy issues.  Price is a contributing factor behind our health care costs.  Compared to other \nnations, consolidation and lack of competition is a major high-price issue. \n \nLet us go to slide 2 [page 2, Exhibit Q].  Prices for health care have increased much faster \nthan inflation, and this slide is a testament.  In the last 20 years, the cost of hospital services \nhas increased 200 percent, when overall inflation increased 54.6 percent.  To compare how \nthat has hit all of us, college tuition in that time has increased 170 percent, other medical \nservices have increased 120 percent, housing has increased 60 percent; so while the average \noverall inflation rate has gone up 54.6 percent, hospitals are at 200 percent.  The next slide \n[page 3] demonstrates how that feels to us if the same thing had happened in the supermarket \nover the last 20 years.  We would be paying $57 for some oranges, a dozen eggs would \ncost $65, and a gallon of milk would cost $160.  This is the trend we are trying to interrupt. \n \nThere are three kinds of consolidation going on [page 4].  One is horizontal mergers, which \nI will talk about now, another is vertical mergers, and then the private equity issues.  Studies \nshow that health care consolidation results in higher prices and without improving quality.  \nThat is happening when hospitals buy other hospitals or doctor groups buy other doctor \ngroups.  That is what horizontal mergers are.  You see an increase in prices, you see an \nincrease in premiums, you see reduced wage growth for the workforce, and you do not see \nincrease in quality in general.  It is not an indicator of increased quality. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 35 \n \nVertical mergers are when one group buys a lower group in the health care tier such as \na hospital buying a doctor group [page 5, Exhibit Q].  We have some state laws about that in \nthis state, but we also have some cases where doctor groups are being bought by hospital \ngroups.  That results in higher clinical prices and also results in higher hospital prices and \nlittle to no quality improvement.  Specific ways that this happens is when a hospital buys  \na physician group, it can then start charging a facility fee for the physician group.  So you are \npaying an additional fee for no additional care because of the cost of the facility now when \na hospital group buys a physician group.  That is one clear way that prices are increasing. \n \nIn the last five years, there has been over $10 billion of private equity investment that has \ngone into health care nationally, and as I said, we are seeing that in Nevada now and the \nother [unintelligible] around it.  State and federal authorities exist to protect this competition, \nand you can see the Attorney General's bill that moved through the session which you \nalready heard.  There is an attorney general's bill that tried to think about how to better look \nat these mergers, but these mergers fly too far below the radar screen for the attorneys \ngeneral to be involved in them.  The Attorney General only gets involved when a merger is \nso large that it changes the entire market all at once, and what we are seeing is incremental \nchange that you do not see at all.  You just feel it and you pay for it. \n \nIt can take years and tremendous resources to do this through the courts, and so what we are \ntrying to do is increase our opportunity to interrupt the price trends that are going on with \neliminating  some  of  the  noncompetitive  language  in  our  contracts,  but  also  create \nenough transparency to see what is going on, even if you cannot interrupt it; to see some \ntransparency laws that we do not have right now, and that is our goal.  Now, Maya Holmes \nwill talk about the bill itself. \n \nMaya Holmes, Healthcare Research Manager, Culinary Health Fund: \nSenate  Bill  329  (1st  Reprint)  will  ensure  that  Nevada  has  accessible  data  on  what  is \nhappening in our health care markets.  Collecting basic information on health care mergers \nand acquisitions is critical for the state—policy makers, patients, payors, employers, and \nother  stakeholders—to  understand  consolidation  in  our  health  care  markets  and  guide \ndecisions that protect competition and patient choice.  Senate Bill 329 (1st Reprint) will also \nprohibit  anticompetitive  contracting  practices  that  hospitals  and  health  care  providers \nwith market dominance can demand because payors need to have them in their networks.  \nSenate Bill 329 (1st Reprint) will address market players using their market power to drive \nup  prices  and  thwart  competition  based  on  price  and  quality.    Recent  settlements  in \ntwo major antitrust lawsuits, one in California and another in North Carolina, ended many \ntypes  of  anticompetitive  contracting  practices  through  those  settlement  agreements.  \nHowever, the settlements do not set legal precedent and only apply to the health systems \ninvolved  in  the  lawsuits.    Anticompetitive  contracting  practices  like  all-or-nothing  and \nanti-steering and anti-tiering provisions prevent health plans from directing or incentivizing \nor communicating with patients to move them toward lower cost, higher quality care.  These \nprovisions also prevent other hospitals from benefiting if they offer better deals or higher \nquality.  They also stop patients and health plans from shopping for and getting the best deal \nthat is appropriate for themselves. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 36 \n \nSpecifically,  S.B.  329  (R1)  has  two  primary  provisions.    The  first  provision  provides \nimportant transparency into consolidation of our health care markets.  The bill will require \nreporting on health care deals in Nevada involving hospitals and physician groups within \n60 days after they have occurred.  This is basic summary information that will be reported, \nand it is listed in the bill, but we do not expect this to add any significant administrative \nburden.  This should all be easy and accessible information.  Senate Bill 329 (1st Reprint) \nalso  requires  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  to  post  the  information \ncontained in the notices on an Internet website maintained by the Department.  Connecticut \nalready does this and has done so for several years.  The Department of Health and Human \nServices will also prepare an annual report regarding market transactions and concentration \nin health care based on the notices and post the report on an Internet website maintained by \nthe Department.   \n \nThe bill's other major provision will make specific anticompetitive contract provisions unfair \ntrade practices.  Prohibited provisions will be void and severable.  The prohibitions will also \nonly apply to new and not existing contracts, so it will not disrupt existing agreements.  The \nspecific contract provisions between hospitals, health systems, providers, and health plans \nthat will be prohibited as unfair trade practices are anti-tiering and anti-steering provisions.  \nThe antitrust language we want this bill to end prohibit flexibility to promote programs that \nhelp patients find the lowest-cost and highest-quality care in the network based on patient \nchoice and priority.  Our plans want to keep all facilities contracted but be able to have \na lower copay for places with a higher-quality program like knee surgery or prenatal care \nwhich cost the patient and the plan less money.  That is what steering does in plan design.  \nInstead of forcing us to treat every hospital the same, which is what the monopoly-like \nlanguage does, we now have to contract with all hospitals the same way regardless of the \nrates they are charging or their quality.  This prevents plans from educating, directing, or \nincentivizing patients to utilize lower-cost, higher-quality care. \n \nThe other provisions that would be prohibited are all-or-nothing contracting.  These clauses \nare when a hospital system refuses to contract with our plan unless all hospitals in their \nsystem are included in the contract.  We usually want this, too, so patients are not confused \nabout where to go in a network, but when a hospital system controls the majority of beds in \na community and they force this provision into the contract, we cannot negotiate on an even \nplaying field.  If we need our members to have access to hospitals near them, we have to take \nall the hospitals the company controls, even if one has quality problems, even if it drives up \nhealth  care  cost  or  is  a  lower-quality  facility.    Forcing  plans  to  include  higher-cost, \nlower-quality facilities and providers is the opposite of value-based care and undermines \nefforts for truly successful coordinated care. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 37 \n \nSenate Bill 329 (1st Reprint)'s prohibitions on anticompetitive contracting provisions like \nanti-tiering  and  anti-steering  and  all-or-nothing  will  not  limit  the  ability  of  a  hospital, \nproviders, or plans to negotiate networks or what those networks will look like.  It will  \nsimply affect language that restricts the ability of plans to communicate with, educate, direct, \nor incentivize their members to utilize lower-cost, higher-quality care which benefits the \npatients and the plans.  Now, Katherine Gudiksen will discuss what is happening in other \nstates. \n \nKatherine Gudiksen, Private Citizen, Piedmont, California: \n[Katherine Gudiksen presented a PowerPoint, Exhibit R.]  I work at The Source on Health \nCare and Competition, and I need to say that I am speaking only for myself today.  Anything \nI say does not represent the views of University of California, Hastings College of the Law, \nThe Source on Health Care Price and Competition, or their funders. \n \nIn our research, we looked at what other states are doing, as Ms. Holmes described [page 2, \nExhibit R].  There were two lawsuits alleging anticompetitive use of anti-tiering or anti-\nsteering clauses.  After those lawsuits were settled, after much time and expense, many states \nhave taken the mantle and asked what they could do to prevent some of this legislation as \nwell.  As you can see from my map, Massachusetts is the only state that has banned these \nprovisions in statute, and their law passed more than two decades ago.  At the federal level, \nCongress considered banning these provisions in a couple of bills last year, and one in the \nproposed Lower Health Care Cost Act of 2019 came close to passing.  The Congressional \nBudget Office issued a report about that bill and found that nationwide, if there was a ban on \nany anti-tiering, anti-steering clauses, the country would save over $1 billion over ten years. \n \nThe interest in these clauses is starting to pick up, partly because of those lawsuits in the \ncongressional  bills.    So  far  this  session,  seven  states  have  introduced  bills  to  prohibit \nanti-tiering or anti-steering clauses—similarly for all-or-nothing clauses, the other clause that \nS.B. 329 (R1) would prohibit [page 3, Exhibit R].  Massachusetts is the only state that has \na restriction, and it is a pretty narrow restriction.  It only applies in narrow-network or \ntiered-network plans, but this clause was considered in that lower health care cost act in \nCongress.  So far this year, six states are considering banning these provisions. \n \nIn  summary,  there  are  eight  states  that  are  considering  bills  to  restrict  anticompetitive \npractices, and it seems to be a subject of growing interest [page 4].  I helped write some \nmodel legislation for the National Academy for State Health Policy because they were \ngetting interest from states to ban the use of these clauses in most insurance contracts.  There \nis growing interest in the ways that state laws can support antitrust enforcement by banning \nspecific provisions that have been used to drive up prices by dominant health firms.  \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 38 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre you ready for questions at this time?  I will start with Assemblyman Hafen. \n \nAssemblyman Hafen: \nUnder the current law, a hospital and doctor groups are covered under one plan.  It is one \nnegotiation, and what we are trying to do is split that up.  I think the term you used was \n\"monopoly.\"  Is that correct? \n \nBobbette Bond: \nThere are two things going on.  One thing we are trying to do in this legislation is to start \ntracking transactions when a group is buying a group.  The second thing we are trying to do \nis, we have contracts with monopoly language in the contracts.  It is not a monopoly between \na hospital and a doctor right now so much that we are talking about today; it is a hospital \nsystem that has created a monopoly in the area.  They have over half the hospital beds, so \nthey insert language into the contract that requires you to not do any of these other creative \nthings about [unintelligible] a physician group that is not their physician group or a hospital \nthat is not in the system that has a great women's health program.  They call that anti-steering \nwhen we tell our patients there is a better place to go, they call that steering the patient so \ncontracts with one hospital system do not allow that.  Because it does not allow it in one \nsystem, it is impacting all the systems because we cannot do it anywhere.  We are not the \nonly ones that face this issue, but we are the ones bringing it to the Legislature today. \n \nAssemblyman Hafen: \nI fully understand that the way insurance and hospital systems work is very confusing.  \nI struggle to figure out where I can go and where I cannot go, but my concern is that right \nnow under the current system, I have a fairly comfortable way of navigating when I go to the \nhospital that some of these things are going to be covered.  It appears under this bill the intent \nis to actually break that up.  If I end up at a hospital that is not in my plan, the radiologist \ngroup may or may not be covered under this plan, and that draws some very serious concerns \nto me.  Maybe you can address why that is a benefit.  I look at a one-stop shop as being of \nmuch more benefit to the patient, including myself, than having to go to a hospital, check in, \nand then be sent to a radiologist group clear across town or, in my case, possibly to another \ntown. \n \nBobbette Bond: \nThat is not where this bill is intending to go.  Where this bill is intending to go is if you are in \nnegotiations with a hospital and you know the quality scores or the price at that hospital is \nhigher and lower in quality than other hospitals, then you want to be able to negotiate a rate \nwith that hospital that takes that into account, or you can negotiate a different rate for \none hospital than for another.  That is one thing we would like to do in our contracts, so that \nis why we talk about it in monopoly terms.  The language that is being [unintelligible] into \ncontracts  does  not  let  us  do  that.    We  are  not  trying  to  eliminate  the  hospital  from \nthe contract, we are trying to be able to steer people to it in different ways.  If it is the most \nexpensive contract we have, then we would tell our patients that they can go to the other \ntwo places  for  less  money.    We  would  tell  them,  This  is  your  cost  share;  it  is  lower \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 39 \n \nsomewhere else, or it is better quality; or you would be able to work with one hospital and \ntheir special women's health program.  That is a real example we are dealing with right now.  \nIt is not about breaking up the hospital and doctors at all.  It is more that we want to eliminate \nthe language that does not allow us to send a patient to one hospital with their radiology \ngroup at a lower cost than the other hospital, because that is called steering.  We are not \ntrying to break up the radiologists from the hospital at all. \n \nChelsea Capurro: \nThis bill does not do anything to address our current contracts.  This is only for things going \nforward.  I would also point out that the biggest thing is that we just want to be able to \ncommunicate to our members what options are out there and what the costs are and what the \nquality is.  This is not going to change our saying you cannot go to this radiologist; you have \nto go here.  It is saying that you can have all these choices.  If you go to radiologist A, it is \ngoing to cost you this; if you go to radiologist B, it may cost you this.  Some of our contracts \nrestrict us from even giving information about cost—what different hospitals may cost if we \ngo there or if a member says, How much will this knee surgery cost us?  We struggle with \nbeing able to direct them and tell them, If you want to go to hospital A versus hospital B, \nhere is what that price difference is going to be. \n \nBobbette Bond: \nTo follow up, I think it is important to say that we think fixing this will impact the networks \nmuch better because right now, our only alternative is to eliminate this hospital system from \nour network.  We do not want to do that.  We want people to have choice, but we want the \nmembers to drive that choice.  We want them to be informed about which hospital they want \nto go to.  If you want to go to the great women's hospital because it has high-quality good \ncare around deliveries, then we want to be able to say that information.  If you want to go to \nwhatever hospital your favorite obstetrician is practicing at, then they should be able to do it, \nbut this is going to be the price difference.  We cannot do that right now. \n \nAssemblyman Hafen: \nI am not following, maybe because I am not an insurance provider or doctor.  First, we want \nto split up the monopolies, and now we, as the insurance provider, want to steer patients to \none hospital or the other.  I am really confused now about what it is we are actually trying \nto do here.  Are we trying to allow the insurance companies to steer to certain hospitals and \naway from other hospitals?  Are we trying to break up a \"monopoly\" and get rid of the \none-stop shop? \n \nChelsea Capurro: \nThis is not about breaking up monopolies; this is about having the opportunity and the ability \nto provide our members, the patients, your constituents, with information about their health \ncare.  If it is helpful, I can follow up with you offline. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 40 \n \nAssemblyman Hafen: \nI keep getting conflicting answers, so I am trying to figure out where we are actually going \nwith this.  Thank you for the answer. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nI had a high-risk pregnancy many years ago and my obstetrician (OB) really wanted me to go \nto a particular hospital where I could receive good care for the delivery of that child.  That \nhospital was not in my group plan.  Are you saying that this would allow me to ask my \ninsurance people if I could go to another hospital and I would be able to go there?  Or would \nit allow you to have that hospital as an option because you looked at your group of insureds \nand saw that you have older patients and that there might be a need for a place for women to \ngo for high-risk pregnancies?  Maybe the group you have a contract with does not have such \na facility and you could add another hospital into the options for that group. \n \nBobbette Bond: \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong, I think it is the second sentence you said.  It would \nallow the insurance plan flexibility to create opportunities for you to go to the hospital.  You \nmight pay a different amount for that, though, and that is called steering.  Alternatively, the \ninsurance  plan  would  not  put  that  hospital  in  network,  and  then  you  would  not  have \nthe opportunity to go there at all.  Our perception of this is that it is a way to keep all of the \nhospitals contracted but have options that are more or less expensive depending on the cost \nand quality of that hospital.  That would be a decision you could make with your doctor.  \nIt increases the decision making you can make with your doctor. \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nThroughout the presentation, you have been mentioning quality scores.  Could you elaborate \nmore on how the quality scores are determined and who determines the scores? \n \nBobbette Bond: \nAt the Health Services Coalition, we follow a series of scores.  Some of them are built into \nour contracts.  For example, what the rate of sepsis is that a hospital would have or how \nmany readmissions the hospital has.  Those are numbers we collect, but it is also public \nrecord.  There are public databases that are created.  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices has a set of scores that they use to compare every hospital in the country.  There is a \ncompany called The Leapfrog Group that has a national set of scores where they compare \nquality.  There are other tools out there, but those are the two biggest ones—the most \ncommonly used ones.  They allow you to see how hospitals are doing across certain factors, \nthen you can bring that into the way you want to contract and the way you want to educate \nyour membership. \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nHow  would  that  work  with,  say,  a  hospital  with  multiple  departments?    Maybe  their \nOB department is really good, but their radiology department might not be so good.  How \nwould that work in that case? \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 41 \n \nBobbette Bond: \nThat is exactly what we are trying to get to.  If their OB department is really great, we would \nlike to be able to highlight that in the way we structure the plans.  Every plan is going to \nstructure the way it works best for their members.  There is not just one structure, but if \nanyone is contracted and we can tier or steer, we could design a plan that says, this hospital \nhas the best OB scores, so we are going to have the lowest rates to go to this hospital because \nthey have the best outcomes.  We are not going to tell you that about the radiology program.   \nWe are going to tell you what we know about the radiology program—those scores that we \ncan get.  It is to help us develop some consumer tools and some patient choice while keeping \nall the hospitals contracted.  What we have to do to do that is remove this language in the \ncontract that does not allow us to do it. \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nThank you.  I would like to follow up later offline about some more questions because I am \nafraid it might take a little while to get some more clarification. \n \nAssemblyman Matthews: \nI  have  a  question  about  the  economics  of  this.    Regarding  section  20.9,  subsection  1, \nparagraph (c), it is my understanding that a hospital's firms are able to provide contractually \nlower prices when they are assured of higher volumes.  Assuming that is the case, when you \nhave the forced fragmentation under this, which I think is what Assemblyman Hafen was \ngetting at, how would this lead to anything but higher prices?  It seems to me that paragraphs \n(c) and (d) would work together to make health care more complex and more expensive for \npatients. \n \nBobbette Bond: \nWe negotiate our contracts in cycles of three to five years.  Our rates and our programs are \nset on what the quality scores are, how much pain a patient experiences, and what the \noutcomes are.  For section 20.9, subsection 1, paragraphs (c) and (d), I think what would \nactually change is instead of us having to just pay a blanket rate for contracts, we would be \nhaving a conversation with the hospital to say, We do not really see the quality in this \nhospital for this procedure.  We would like to talk about different rates.  It is possible, as you \nare suggesting, that the rate at one hospital would go up for us, not for our members, but for \nus to pay that rate.  However, on others it would go down, and then you would look to steer \npeople to the best care for them for that procedure they need and that will help us manage \ncosts and outcomes.  I think we did get good value out of a rate, of having all the hospitals \ncontracted,  but  there  is  no  flexibility  in  this  steering  language;  if  they  removed  that \nanti-steering language, anything else is handled in the contract.  If the hospitals want to \ncharge us more because we are now able to steer our patients, that is a negotiation point with \nthe hospitals instead of just a prohibition.   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 42 \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank you, Senator Lange, for bringing the bill forward.  Your concerns about health care \ncosts are accurate as far as the health care costs rising and what we are doing to lower health \ncare costs.  Having had to give up private practice after 15 years and go to work for a local \nhospital because I could not afford to be a private practitioner any longer, I am acutely aware \nof the problems in health care and cost.  However, I have concerns about what this bill does \nand that it may lead to the opposite of what you are trying to solve.  As an insurance \nprovider, or payor, as the Culinary Union is, I see you as being almost as guilty of the very \nthing you are trying to say physicians or providers are.  Do your Culinary Union members \nhave the option of another insurance plan other than what you offer them? \n \nBobbette Bond: \nOur insurance plan gives them a comprehensiveness of coverage and a large network in all \nthe hospitals contracted, and that is just us.   Stacie Sasso with the Health Services Coalition \ncan talk more about the other 24 plans that are in the Coalition. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nWhen you have a contract, as a provider, I know many years ago something called the Stark \nLaw [Physician Self-Referral Law] came out.  In the interests of lowering costs, the federal \ngovernment recognized that providers should not own the X-ray equipment that they then \nrefer their patients to.  There were national concerns about that increasing the cost of health \ncare, so there have been regulations already to help lower the cost.  For me, what I see the \nCulinary Union do, or your insurance plan do as other insurance plans do, is you negotiate \ncertain rates with hospitals.  It is not about cost reimbursement.  Your wanting to know what \nthe true cost is of doing business I think would be ideal.  If you paid and reimbursed the \nproviders—all providers—their costs, you might be surprised that health care rates would \ncome down because they would not be charging the extra fees for those who are not getting \nreimbursed at all for the care they give. \n \nI think the concept and the solution would be if we truly did know and ask all across the \nboard what the actual cost of doing business was.  That, for me, would be the solution to cost \nreimbursement.  I am not sure you are asking the providers the right questions as opposed to \npreventing them from joining.  I had to join something else because I could not stay in \nbusiness.  You are going after the providers and even making it a felony—in section 20.9 it \nbecomes a felony, but we are trying to stay alive.  Most of these mergers are happening, not \nbecause they want to make more money, but, frankly, they want to stay in business.  They \ncannot survive.  A small group of five, for instance, cannot survive because they do not get \nreimbursed enough. \n \nI would support efforts along your line to find out what the true cost of doing business is and \nthen make sure you cover the cost of doing business.  Then there would not be the winners \nand losers I am seeing right now.  You, then, would be in the driver's seat of negotiating \nthese contracts.  For me, this does absolutely the opposite of the problem I am hearing you \nare trying to solve—which is allow your members to know where they can go and what those \ncosts genuinely are and then direct them—if you go to this hospital, the cost is this.  I do that \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 43 \n \nnow in health care.  I have my patients call the radiology department and find out what it is \ngoing to cost to have a CAT scan, especially for a cash payor, and negotiate the cost.  I think \nthat is the solution, and I am very concerned that this bill does absolutely the opposite of \nwhat you are trying to do. \n \nBobbette Bond: \nWe agree with you that more transparency is needed.  We spend a lot of time as a coalition \non health care transparency.  The issue you are raising about section 20.9, the felony, is not \nabout the merger.  If it makes it prohibitive to have this language in the contract that does \nnot allow us to tier and steer, that is what is being [unintelligible].  That language no longer \ncan be used in contract to prohibit us from doing the tiering or steering we are talking about.  \nThat is what we are trying to stop.  The reason it is a felony is that is the way the state law is \nwritten about what happens in a situation where you are dealing with this antitrust agreement. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nI have clarifying legal questions about section 1.  There were a couple of concerns about the \nbreadth which this section would cover—mergers and acquisitions.  As we know, not every \nhospital or provider in the state is isolated to the state of Nevada.  In this language, would \nthis pertain to only mergers and acquisitions in the state of Nevada?  My second question \ninvolves  the  fact  that  when  we  talk  about  other  affiliations  between  physician  group \npractices,  we  talk  about  physician  group  practices  and  hospitals.    Does  this  pertain  to \nsituations  in  which  we  have  an  insurance  company  that  is  a  part  of  a  health  care \nprovider/hospital entity that may be acquiring new facilities or partners under their umbrella? \n \nBobbette Bond: \nI know what the intent of the bill is, and the answer to your second question is, yes, it would \ncapture those.  The answer to your first question—would this cross state lines—would be, no, \nbecause it is a state statute.  HCA Healthcare has three hospitals in Las Vegas; it should only \nimpact them in Las Vegas.  It would not impact them in Arizona. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nI would ask our legal counsel to weigh in on what this language does say and ensure that is \nbeing covered under this language. \n \nKarly O'Krent, Committee Counsel: \nI will take the questions one at a time, starting with whether this applies to providers that \nhave groups in other states.  It is possible that this bill would apply to providers that have \ngroups in other states if those groups merged with groups in this state.  The Committee, if it \nso chose, could amend the bill to make the bill only applicable to provider groups in this \nstate.  The Committee would need to specify exactly how that would look.  With regard to \nthe other question, section 1 of the bill does not apply to insurers.  I am not sure if that \naddresses your concerns, but that is how the bill works as it is currently drafted.  \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 44 \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nMy question was related to groups such as Optum that have provider umbrellas also under \ntheir insurance network.  As they purchase those providers under their umbrella, would that \nscenario be captured under the data collection described in section 1, or would it be excluded \nbecause Optum is an insurance company? \n \nKarly O'Krent: \nAs it is currently drafted, it would be excluded from section 1 because Optum is an insurance \ncompany. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nThank you for that clarification.  If I may, Chair Nguyen, I have additional questions related \nto section 20.9.  I am not familiar with contract language in your negotiated contracts with \nhealth care providers.  As I read some of this, I got concerned about situations in which you \nwould want to have those hospitals and their attached groups in the same coverage, if that \nwas your only option, which is one of the scenarios in northern Nevada—we have two major \nhospital groups.  Often, patients prefer to use those network groups because they know they \nare covered under their insurance or they are connected by the way they share data or bill or \nwhatever.  When you are talking about the language that restricts these different points, these \nparagraphs in section 20.9, subsection 1, what does that language look like?  Would it be if \nI saw a contract that said, We are contracting with this group and its subgroups?  Would that \nqualify as this \"Requires the third party to place all providers of health care affiliated with a \nbusiness entity in the same tier,\" as stated in section 20.9, subsection 1, paragraph (c), or is \nthere separate language in the contract that says, Upon contracting, we limit you to only our \ngroups under our network umbrella and they are listed below? \n \nBobbette Bond: \nI think what we would do is your second example, but I want to make sure I understand what \nyou are saying. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nCan you give us an example of the language in your contracts that restricts you from steering \nand tiering that you are trying to eliminate with this language? \n \nBobbette Bond: \nThere is language in some of our contracts that we have been unable to remove through \ncontract negotiations that say we are not allowed to tier or steer in any way.  When we say \nwhat we want to do is start the program where we can provide special benefits inside our \nfunds or inside our coalition to allow, for example, someone to go to a women's health \nprogram that is only at one hospital.  We want to make a separate price for that, we want to \nhave our maternity patients go there, and that is called tiering, that is called steering.  We are \nnot allowed right now to do it because of that one sentence in our contract that prohibits \ntiering and steering.  That is all we are trying to do is remove that one sentence and allow the \nrest of the contract to flow as a contract would. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 45 \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nIn this bill, why is there not just a line item that says contracts cannot include clauses that \nprohibit steering and tiering?  Instead, there are these descriptions of restricting, requiring, \nand prohibiting. \n \nBobbette Bond: \nI think the language is nationally established language that was suggested by our consultant \nto make sure we capture the issues that steering and tiering are.  It became a more specific \nexplanation, but the intent is what you just said—that is where you go; that is what you get. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nI do not want to have a scenario come up where an insurance provider has a contract with a \nhealth provider that inadvertently puts them in a situation where they have restricted their \nnetwork to only that provider umbrella and then put them in this category.  That is my \nconcern, and I want to get on the record that the intent is not to capture those scenarios.   \nIn that good-faith negotiation, those situations can happen, but what this is really trying to get \nat is that anti-steering, anti-tiering clause that prohibits you from doing those things within \nyour member groups. \n \nMy other question had to do with how this language you are presenting here in section 20.9 \ncompares to the language that was referenced in Maryland. \n \nKatherine Gudiksen: \nI think you meant Massachusetts.  The language is quite similar.  I think the anti-tiering, \nanti-steering is the same, but I would have to go back and read it.  I can get the statute and \ncitation for the Committee; it is very similar to Massachusetts' language. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nIf you would follow up with the Committee with that information, that would be helpful. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nIn section 20.9, section 1, there are five things—five \"shall nots\"—paragraphs (a), (b), (c), \n(d), and (e).  What gets negotiated and what gets contracted are read or seen by people, \nbecause I imagine some of these things are probably proprietary, so there is not a bunch of \ncontracts lying around that we can read.  What might be helpful is clarity on the \"shall nots.\"  \nWe have been focusing on paragraph (a)—the incentives, steering.  Could you give us an \nexample of what the \"shall not\" is, and, if enacted, what the \"will allow\" is?  That way we \ncould hold an example of each one of those things in our heads.  I heard a reference to a \nwomen's clinic, but I do not think I have it quite contextually.  That might be helpful and also \ngood for the legislative record on concretely where we are on the status quo on paragraphs \n(a) through (e), and then where the bill will lead us with (a) through (e).   For example, \nparagraph (a) mentions incentives.  Do we have \"incentives\" defined somewhere?  When we \nthink of incentives, is it like a bonus in a health savings account?  Is it a lollipop?  That is \nwhat I am looking for.  Take your example down to a little bit more pedestrian level and \noutside of contract law. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 46 \n \nBobbette Bond: \nIt restricts a third party from offering incentives.  We want to remove that so that we \ncan offer incentives for our covered persons using a specific provider.  We could make \na lower copay.  That would be an incentive.  They would have a lower copay to go to a \nspecific provider.  Right now, that is prohibited but would be allowed under section 20.9, \nsubsection 1, paragraph (a).   \n \nIt restricts a third party from assigning providers in health care into tiers.  Now we have to \nhave all our hospitals have completely equal communication materials, copays, deductibles, \nlisting in our directory—everything has to be exactly the same among our providers.  If there \nare tiers, we could say, Okay, for knee surgery at this hospital—and we did this in our benefit \ndesign in our contract—it is going to cost you, the patient, $250 to go to hospital A.  \nHowever, because of the quality scores and the cost to us, it is going to cost you $125 to go \nhere.  That is tiering.  That is in section 20.9, subsection 1, paragraph (b).  I will need help \nwith defining paragraph (c). \n \nKatherine Gudiksen: \nSection 20.9, subsection 1, paragraph (c), would be if a health system said you need to put all \nour clinics in the same tier at the same cost-sharing.  For example, if you wanted to put our \nwomen's health at the lowest cost pay, you have to also put our radiology group and our MRI \nmachines at that same rate.  It prohibits a health system from saying that everyone has to be \nat the same tier and gives the insurer or payor the flexibility there.   \n \nParagraph (d), the fourth item, requires a third party to contract with a business entity \naffiliated with the provider as a condition of entering that contract.  For example, if an insurer \nwanted to only contract with the main hospital and not all of that hospital's affiliated clinics \nthat they felt were of lower quality, this would prevent the health system from only offering a \ncontract that was for all of those systems.  The insurer has to be given the right to contract \nwith just one of those entities. \n \nParagraph (e) prohibits the third party from contracting with a provider of health care that is \nnot a party to the contract or a third party from entering into such contract.  That one is more \nabout exclusive contracting.  That one is where the provider prohibits the third party from \ncontracting with someone else.  If you want to contract it with us, we are the only ones who \ncan provide that service. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nPieces of the audio were not great, so I had difficulty hearing.  Section 20.9, subsection 1, \nparagraphs (b) and (c) are talking about tiers; one is tier restrictions and the other talks about \ntier clumping, right?  I think I heard the example that it would be a lower copay for the \ninsured person to be able to say one hospital will cost $250, but if you go to this other \nhospital, it will cost $125.  That is where you would see that tiering—price tiering.  It is not \nnecessarily  categorical  tiering.    That  would  be  the  same  for  paragraph  (c)—pricing  in \ndifferent tiers versus all groups, the women's clinic and MRI groups, all having to be one cost \nto the insured person.   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 47 \n \nBobbette Bond: \nWhat she is saying in the last part of her sentence, I am not sure that is what that is. \n \nKatherine Gudiksen: \nOn paragraph (c), it would depend on how the insurer has structured those tiers.  Typically, \nthey are different costs—either copays or cost sharing—but it would be up to the insurer to \ndetermine what it would mean to be in tier 1 versus tier 2.  The language there prohibits the \nhealth system from requiring everything to be in the same tier with that same cost sharing or \ncopay, however those tiers have been structured. \n \nThe restriction on paragraph (b) is just a restriction to even be putting them in tiers.  Some of \nthese contracts do say that if you want to contract with us, you cannot have a tiered network.  \nParagraph (b) just requires the health system to allow the insurer/payor to have a tiered \nnetwork to begin with. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nIs this the normal course of business?  The way the contracts are coming out across the \nboard, no matter where you go to contract, you are going to run into these tier restrictions and \nthe  networking,  contracting  to  contract,  paragraph  (d),  contracting  with  affiliates.    For \ninstance, if you are going to contract with me, you need to have the whole kit and caboodle.  \nAm I correct in assuming that those types of pieces are probably boilerplate for most insurers \nwhen they are negotiating contracts with hospitals?  Or is it a uniquely Western trend or a \nuniquely Nevada trend? \n \nBobbette Bond: \nI do not know how unique it is, and we do not do it now.  We do not do it now because if it \nwere held up in one contract, it would be held up.  We cannot do any tiering or steering, so I \ndo not know how common the tiering or the steering is in plans.  We just do not do it and the \nCoalition does not do it.  What we would like, in order to make sure we keep all of our \nhospitals contracted, is the ability to do it when we feel like we should be able to do it.  I do \nnot know how widespread it is, though.  It would all be negotiated in contracts, so we would \njust be removing the language that prohibits us from doing it and then negotiating it in a \ncontract. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nIt  sounds  like  de-aggregating  and  then  negotiating  all  of  these  pieces  out.    We  are  in \nNevada Revised  Statutes  (NRS)  Chapter  598,  so  we  are  in  the  chapter  on  unfair  trade \npractices.  As I read the chapter, and this is general law, applicable law, there is nothing \nreally targeted toward health care in here right now.  I understand that the chapter has been \napplied toward health care, so we have some case law out there on some of these things \nI would  imagine  such  as  the  noncompetes,  which  I  think  section  20.9,  subsection  1, \nparagraph (d), would be interpreted as—the contract with our affiliates—but I do not see \nanything in here.  It may have been a piece of Assemblywoman Peters' question, but that is  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 48 \n \nalready inherently illegal, right?  The exclusivity, contractor exclusivity—if you contract \nwith us, you cannot contract with anyone else for provider groups.  Am I correct in that \nassumption as well, that NRS Chapter 598 gets used as a tool in health care?  I would guess  \nfrom these \"shall nots,\" not as frequently as we might think, or it is an arduous process, or it \nfeels like it.  When it comes specifically to conversations about these contracts, the level is \ndifferent than it might be for investigating other types of acquisitions and such. \n \nBobbette Bond: \nWhat I understand from what you are saying is the unfair trade practice language.  That \nlanguage was just referenced in statute because we want it to be unfair; we do not have any \nextra hooks on this; we do not have any other way to prohibit; we do not have a fine; and we \ndo not have a way to otherwise penalize a contract that has this in it.  I think what is going to \nhappen is we just will not have this language anymore.  That section will be out of our \ncontracts because no one wants to commit an unfair trade practice, but the rest of the \nlanguage in here that is referencing this is related to the state statute now; it is not specific to \nthis bill. \n \nKatherine Gudiksen: \nCalifornia brought up interstate antitrust law in their lawsuit against Sutter Health, against \nstate antitrust law.  At a certain level, this does rise to an antitrust violation that could be \nbrought under state antitrust law.  This basically eliminates the need for proving under \nthe standards and geographic markets, et cetera, that are needed for an antitrust lawsuit.  The \nSutter case took a decade to reach settlement, and that is the reason for this law. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any other questions from Committee members at this time?  Seeing none, I will \nbegin testimony in support of S.B. 329 (R1). \n \nRusty McAllister, Executive Secretary-Treasurer, Nevada State AFL-CIO: \nMy first session lobbying was in 1999.  I was a firefighter and also the chairman of a health \ninsurance trust fund.  I got to attend a subcommittee meeting and the subject was clinical \npsychologists trying to pass statutes that would make it so that the marriage and family \ncounselors could not see certain patients.  They had to go to a doctor first and not to the \nlicensed counselors.  I listened to the hearing and then was asked if I wanted to say anything.  \nI asked if I could ask a question of the testifiers and was told, sure.  My question was, \nIf someone came to you and had a marriage problem or family counseling problem, would \nyou refer that person to them?  The answer came back, No, why would we?  We are licensed \nto do that, so they were basically cutting them out of the business.  I replied, All I know is \nthis.  If it costs $200 an hour to go see that person or $50 an hour to go see that other person, \nour members, if they cannot go there, they will not go there.  They will not go see that \nperson, and if they do not get the mental health care they need, bad things happen.  The more \nthings change, the more they stay the same.  That was in 1999. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 49 \n \nWe are battling every day as the chairman of the health insurance trust fund, and I watch \nthese  people  who  run  these  health  programs  now.    I  had  only  3,500  members  in  our \ntrust fund.  Assemblywoman Titus mentioned constantly trying to keep her head above \nwater.  That is what health trusts are trying to do—anything we can do to limit the ability of \nhospitals, networks, or providers to increase costs.  There is only so much money—you \ncannot just go get more money and give it to them.  The bottom line is, we are constantly \ntrying whatever methods and techniques we can to limit our liability.  We believe that \nS.B. 329 (R1) allows patients and health plans to shop for and get the best options available \nto them both in quality and cost.  For those reasons, we are in support of this.  Our 150,000 \nmembers and their families need techniques like these to try to limit the costs that are going \nout of their pockets every day.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIs there anyone else to testify in support of S.B. 329 (R1)? \n \nPaul Catha, Political Organizer, Culinary Workers Union Local 226: \nThe  Culinary  Workers  Union  supports  S.B.  329  (R1)  because  health  care  affordability, \nquality, and access are critical concerns for Culinary Union members.  Consolidation in the \nhealth care industry drives up prices but not the quality of our health care.  Senate Bill 329 \n(1st Reprint) will take important steps to understand how consolidation impacts our health \ncare markets.  In addition, S.B. 329 (R1) will stop anticompetitive contracting practices that \nprevent patients, employers, and plans from shopping for and getting the best deal.  The \nCulinary Union urges the Nevada Legislature to support and pass S.B. 329 (R1).  \n \nDeanna Leivas, Secretary Treasurer, United Food and Commercial Workers Union \nLocal 711: \nOn behalf of the 6,800 members of the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 711, \nI am speaking in support of S.B. 329 (R1).  The bill will allow the state, policy makers, \npatients, payors, and other stakeholders to understand consolidation in our health care market \nand its impact on prices, affordability, quality, and access.  It will provide vital information \nto guide decisions that protect competition and patient choice.  Senate Bill 329 (1st Reprint) \nwill also prohibit anticompetitive contracting practices at hospitals and health care providers \nwith market dominance and demand because payors have to have them in their networks.  \nThis  will  prevent  dominant  market  participants  from  exercising  their  market  power  to \ndrive up  prices  and  thwart  competition  based  on  price  and  quality.    Anticompetitive \ncontracting practices like all-or-nothing, anti-steering, and anti-tiering prevent health plans \nfrom  directing  or  incentivizing  patients  toward  lower-cost,  higher-quality  care.    These \nprovisions also prevent other hospitals from benefiting if they offer better deals or higher \nquality.  They also stop patients and health plans from shopping for and getting the best \ndeals.  Senate Bill 329 (1st Reprint) will prohibit anti-steering and anti-tiering clauses which \nrequire health plans to treat all of the health systems' hospitals in the most favorable tier with \nthe lowest cost sharing regardless of the rates they are charging or their quality.  Thank you, \nand I urge you to pass S.B. 329 (R1).  \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 50 \n \nJuston Larsen, Member, Culinary Workers Union Local 226: \nI am testifying today in support of S.B. 329 (R1).  I have had asthma since I was a child.  \nI carry an inhaler everywhere I go just in case I have an asthma attack.  I want to be an \ninformed and empowered patient, so I need to have information to be able to better advocate \nfor myself.  I trust my Culinary Health Fund to help make sure I am going to the best quality \nof care for the lowest price.  I wish that my Culinary Health Fund advocate could give me \nadvice on which place is best for me to go:  a place that is safe, a medical professional who is \na good doctor, and a clinic that is the lowest copay for me.  Right now, due to anti-steering \nand anti-tiering language in hospital contracts, my Culinary Health Fund is not able to give \nme complete information that I need and deserve, and that is not right.  Removing the \nanticompetitive clauses from hospital contracts will allow my Culinary Health Fund to better \ngive me the complete information so I can get my health needs met better.  Please support \nS.B. 329 (R1). \n \nTodd Ingalsbee, President, Professional Fire Fighters of Nevada: \nWe are here in support of S.B. 329 (R1).  Managing our health care and its costs is a full-time \njob for us.  We are constantly putting our lives and health on the line, from work-related \nphysical injuries to heart and lung disease due to the cancer-causing carcinogens we are \nexposed to daily, it is vitally important that this piece of legislation pass.  Without this, we \nhave situations where we are unable to communicate to our members about where they can \nget the best care due to anti-tiering and anti-steering language that we are forced into with \nour hospital contracts.  Our self-funded health trust needs to be able to educate our members, \nespecially about where they can get the highest quality and lowest cost care.  There are many \ntimes when we are prohibited from doing that, especially in a field that is so rife with \ninjuries, disease, and, unfortunately, premature death.  It is wrong that we are restricted from \ngiving our members the basic information.  This bill brings transparency about what is going \non in the health care market in Nevada and allows us to educate our members about the best \noptions out there for them.  We ask your support for S.B. 329 (R1) to help our members so \nthey are able to take care of themselves so we can take care of all our residents and guests in \nNevada. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWith no more callers in support, at this time we will begin testimony in opposition to \nS.B. 329 (R1). \n \nGeorge  Ross,  representing  Sunrise  Hospital  and  Medical  Center;  MountainView \nHospital; and HCA Healthcare: \nDo I have just two minutes, or may I use three minutes? \n \nChair Nguyen: \nGo ahead with your testimony, and we may have some additional questions for you as well \nfrom Committee members. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 51 \n \nGeorge Ross: \nI want to express our profound appreciation to the sponsor of the bill, Senator Lange.  She \nmet with us with an open mind and gave us a great deal of time to go over this bill.  The most \ncritical piece of this bill is the antitrust section—section 20.9, subsection 1.  HCA Healthcare \ndoes not do section 20.9, subsection 1, paragraph (a).  They do not do paragraph (b), and they \ndo not do paragraph (e), so what we are going to focus on are paragraphs (c) and (d).  With \nregard to paragraph (c), we believe that the provider should be explicitly permitted to offer \nincentives in the contract bargaining process to include those of its own entities in the \ncontract or in the same tier.  Proponents seemed to imply that they thought that to be the case, \nbut the lawyers I have talked to who have read this believe that this may prohibit that from \nhappening.  We would like to have explicit language allowing the provider to offer such \nincentives.  This would enable a higher volume of patients and thus enable a more discounted \nrate.  It would also permit coordination of care.  Hospital Corporation of America has \nconsciously put together a system which enables the providers to get the patients to the right \nplace for the needed treatment in a timely manner, thus seamlessly to the patient.  We would \nlike to explicitly know that is permitted, and why that is important is that, at the end of this \nbill, it says a violation of this section is a felony.  This language is pretty vague.  We have \nalready had discussions about what it means.  It is very important that a normal bargaining \nprocess not get you into a situation where you can be accused by an aggressive attorney or \naggressive opponent of committing a felony. \n \nWith regard to section 20.9, subsection 1, paragraph (d), similarly, providers should be able \nto incentivize the payor to contract with affiliated groups.  Those groups that provide your \nradiology treatment, your anesthesiology treatment, your hospitalists, having these together is \nessential to providing the continuity and coordination of care as well as preventing the \ndifficult situation that can happen when a patient thinks he or she is going to an in-network \nhospital,  and  then  wakes  up  after  surgery  to  find  out  that  the  anesthesiologist  or  the \nradiologist or the hospitalist is in a different network, and all of a sudden they are paying \nout-of-network charges.  Plus, when you do not have that connection, you have much less \ncoordination, much less cooperation.  We would love to see that section cut out altogether, \nbut if not, it should be changed to explicitly permit the provider to incentivize the payor in \nthe bargaining process to contract with affiliated groups as necessary for profit continuity, \ncoordination, and integration of care.  Without that, this puts the patient in a very difficult \nsituation.  It is my understanding that the [unintelligible] which was referred to, actually \nallows hospitals to ask for contracts with doctors providing services in that area or at that \nhospital for the reason of continuity of care. \n \nEssentially, failure to fix section 20.9, subsection 1, paragraphs (c) and (d), as we are asking, \nwill leave the patients in a very difficult situation.  They would be facing a fragmented, \ndisorganized, confusing medical environment in terms of both health care and figuring out \ntheir  billing.    I  know  there  are  certain  payors,  and  we  have  heard  from  one  of  them \nextensively here today, who probably takes their patients almost by the hand and guides  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 52 \n \nthem around, but the vast majority of Nevadans are not in that situation.  They are left to do \nthis on their own, and now that neither I nor my wife are as young as we used to be, we are \ndoing a lot of health care.  It is quite a confusing situation.  Having everyone at least in the \nsame network certainly would make life exceptionally easier. \n \nFinally, antitrust violations should not constitute a felony.  Antitrust cases are typically civil \ncases.    The  language  in  paragraphs  (c)  and  (d)  is  ambiguous  and  open  to  very  varied \ninterpretations.  To make trying to achieve a situation where the doctor groups serving a \nhospital are not in a payor's network a felony is a recipe for much worse and expensive care \nas well as a very anxious and confusing world for the patient.  The beginning statements \ntalked a lot about health care costs, and this is a way to bring down health care costs.  But \nI think I have the right to say that the single most important thing this Legislature and the \nadvocates of this bill could do to bring down their health care costs is to join together with all \nof us and convince the Legislature to increase Medicaid reimbursements to providers.  The \nsingle reason why those costs are so high is because we have to shift such a large amount of \ncost onto the commercial and trust fund payors.  It is very simple.  Katherine Gudiksen talked \nabout how much health care costs have gone up.  Well, since 2001, hospitals have gotten one \nraise in Medicaid rates—2.5 percent—which was taken away from us last summer.  That is \nall we have gotten.  If you wonder why costs are going up, that is a very, very large reason. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any follow-up questions? \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nGoing back to the same question about section 20.9, subsection 1, and the \"shall nots\" and \nparagraphs (a) through (e), it looks as though paragraphs (a), (b), and (e) are off the table \nand we are focusing on paragraphs (c) and (d).  Could you talk a little more about the \npractices that are allowed now that will become the \"shall nots\"?  What it will allow from \nyour perspective. \n \nGeorge Ross: \nI cannot speak for any other company on that and I am not the negotiator on ours, but I can \ntell you that we do not require them all to be in the same tier, and we do not require them all \nto contract with all our entities.  However, we would like to be able to incentivize them to do \nso if we chose to.  If we could give them an incentive good enough for them to do it, we \nwould love that. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nPerfect. \n \nGeorge Ross: \nHopefully, they would find the lower price we could give them for that volume to be \nattractive as part of the bargaining process.  We just want to make sure that the normal \nbargaining process, because of the way this bill is worded, is not suddenly becoming a crime. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 53 \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI appreciate that.  Again, going to incentives to make sure we are clear for the record:  In the \nway we have been talking about it, it seems to mean financial incentives.  Is that right? \n \nGeorge Ross: \nYes.   \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nTherefore,  section  20.9,  subsection  1,  paragraph  (d),  is  contracting  with  affiliates.  \nObviously, if a hospital wants to say, Here is the hospital network we have built out.  \nWe have the hospital, we have the clinics, we have an urgent care, and we have specialties, \nso the idea would be to incentivize people to stay in the hospital network.  That would be \ncontracted and negotiated—the incentive to stay in, versus the way it is being talked about \nright now—the status quo.  You are all in the hospital's network or you are not. \n \nGeorge Ross: \nWe do not mandate that, but we like to incentivize it.  In terms of section 20.9, subsection 1, \nparagraph (d), the way we read that, it refers to affiliated entities.  It is not necessarily the \nones we own.  In this case, we believe that means, the way our lawyers and negotiators write \nit, it is talking about the doctors' group that we made a contract with to do their radiology.  \nThe doctors' group we made a contract with to do the ER, and so on—all the places where \nyou get a doctors' group to do it.  It is a real mess when all of a sudden you have to pay out of \nnetwork when you are in a network hospital.  From a patient point of view, those are the \nkinds of things where a patient would say, What does this bill mean?  Why do I have this?  \nWhy do I have that?  It can drive you crazy.  This will make life a lot simpler, a lot more \norganized, but more importantly, it will help coordinate care.  When the hospitals work with \nthese groups where they have contracts, they can interact and coordinate.   \n \nThe best example I can give you of some of this is when I had an operation at MountainView \nHospital on my elbow.  I had my stitches out.  The next morning there was a lot of blood in \nmy bed.  I got in my car and drove down the freeway to Southern Hills Hospital & Medical \nCenter's ER.  It took me about 10 or 15 seconds to get in there because all my information \nwas right there in their computer system.  They had everything they needed.  It was very \ncoordinated.  They could see everything that happened to me right there.  I respect what the \nproponents are trying to do here.  They have a noble objective, but we want to make sure that \nour ability to provide the best possible care we can in a coordinated manner to the patients \nand  give  them  as  good  an  experience  as  possible  is  not  inadvertently  or  advertently \neliminated by the way this bill is worded. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI  should  clarify.    When  I  was  talking  about the  hospital  and  their network  and  I  was \nreferencing the buildings, we know that very few people are hospital employees.  They have \nthe  brick  and  mortar  then  hire  the  physician  groups  to  come  in.    You  might  have  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 54 \n \nadministration—payroll  and  human  resources  and  maybe  some  others  tend to  be  direct \nemployees—but maybe 10 percent of the people you see in a hospital are actually employees \nof that hospital and the rest are contract groups. \n \nGeorge Ross: \nThe nurses are all employees. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nYes.  When I am talking about specialty clinics, urgent cares, it is the groups that are staffing \nthose.  In section 20.9, subsection 1, paragraph (e), it says they shall not do exclusive \ncontracting, so those provider groups will be contracting with multiple entities as well, which \nI think they can do now because we have some case law on that. \n \nGeorge Ross: \nThat is correct.  We have no problem with doing that; we do not stop them from doing that.  \nWe have no problem with that piece of the bill.  If there is a group that wants to contract with \ntwo or three different hospital groups, fine. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nThis is really complicated, and our intent is to do the right thing for our constituents.  This \nbill, if I am not mistaken when I listened to the earlier testimony, does not allow for there to \nbe fines and fees if people do not comply.  If there is no vehicle for fines and fees, and the \nonly vehicle that is allowed here is a felony, what else can be done?  I think we have seen \nenough corporate misbehavior.  Often when people are fined, they continue poor behavior \nbecause they can afford to pay.  It may seem egregious, but if you have a suggestion about \nhow we can get people to comply, I would like to hear it. \n \nGeorge Ross: \nYou can always make it a misdemeanor and not a felony.  Ideally, you could put fines \nin.  You could put penalties in there but even then, we would think.  If you just allow normal \nbargaining—because several times the proponents referenced that is part of the bargaining of \nthe contract—if you can just put in here that we are allowed to incentivize those two items \nI talked about, we would not have any worries and we would not be worried about getting a \nfelony because we would not be breaking the law.  We do not do section 20.9, subsection 1, \nparagraph (a), we do not do paragraph (b), and we do not do paragraph (e).  We just want to \nmake sure that we can continue to provide coordinative, high-quality care that is good for the \npatient and puts the patient in a good place without committing a felony. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIf I could just clarify, Mr. Ross, NRS Chapter 598 already has those violations go to district \ncourt.  I believe that is existing statute.  \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 55 \n \nGeorge Ross: \nI am not an attorney. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI will ask Ms. O'Krent because I believe that is already existing in the statutes, so this is not a \nnew provision.  Ms. O'Krent, can you clarify that, or do you need additional time? \n \nKarly O'Krent: \nThat is correct. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI just wanted to make sure the record was clear that is language that already exists in \nNRS Chapter 598. \n \nGeorge Ross: \nI have done a lot of health lobbying up here for two decades, and every time you change the \nhealth care law, it shows up in about one little blue line in about seven or eight very long \nparagraphs because there are all these different kinds.  I am not a lawyer, but maybe we \ncould put it in a different section and get rid of it that way.  If that is what it requires, make a \nnew section. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe have another question from a Committee member. \n \nAssemblywoman Krasner: \nThank you, Mr. Ross, for being here.  This is a complicated bill, but I do know that \nwhen people get sick or their loved one gets sick, they want the state-of-the-art hospital.  \nThey want the best doctors, but here in Nevada, we have one of the lowest Medicaid \nreimbursement  rates  in  the  United  States.    In  the  special  session,  we  reduced \nMedicaid reimbursement rates an additional 6 percent.  How will those factors, coupled with \nthis bill, affect our state and health care for the people in our state? \n \nGeorge Ross: \nI do not think it will help.  If it passes as written, I think it will have a negative impact on \nhow people receive health care and how people experience health care for the reasons \nI stated.  The best thing we can do to improve health care in this state is to increase the \nMedicaid reimbursement rate.  You need to pay doctors enough to take Medicaid patients.  \nWe are very low on medical, but when you drive through Henderson or you drive through \nparts of Summerlin, you are not seeing any shortage of doctors.  Where you see the shortage \nof doctors is in east Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, and northeast Las Vegas.  Where do the \nmajority of the folks who are on Medicaid live?  Those same places I just listed.   You need \nto pay the doctors enough that they will take and see Medicaid patients, and similarly, if you \npay the hospitals a somewhat fair rate—comparable to other states.  I know it was said  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 56 \n \nearlier, but we have at least five entities that own hospitals in Las Vegas.  It is fairly \ncompetitive when you do those contracts.  It is one reason why someone apparently tries \nsome of these other things to get an edge.  It is quite competitive, so it will not take long if \nyou start raising the Medicaid reimbursement rates when the cost-shifting gets less and the \ncontracts to the payors go down.  We do not like having to do that, but if you do not push \nthose rates up, a hospital does not survive. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nMr. Ross, can I get you to direct this toward the contents of this bill?  I know we have other \npeople who want to testify here as well, so we will go to the lines for testimony in opposition \nto S.B. 329 (R1). \n \nJames Wadhams, representing Nevada Hospital Association: \nI would like to thank Senator Lange for the time she spent talking openly to the sponsors of \nthe bill.  That has been a very open and robust discussion.  The bill with its amendment is \nmuch improved.  We do still have some concerns, and it is part of the reason we have been \naddressing these questions.  There is not only a felony potential, but there is a private right of \naction, treble damages, and attorney's fees, so this element of section 20.9 is very serious.  \nIt has to be precise.  Many of the Committee members' questions have drawn attention to the \nambiguity, for example, in the phrase in what we have just been talking about in section 20.9, \nsubsection 1, paragraphs (c) and (d) on business affiliates.  Does that mean the affiliation of \nthe in-house basic hospital services, such as lab and radiology and anesthesiology, or is that a \nreference to external, but affiliated, facilities?  That needs to be clarified for all the reasons of \nthe treble damages and the felony. \n \nThe other element is making sure of the language.  If the Committee will look at section 20.9, \nsubsection 1, I think there is a concern that there may be ambiguity in the way that language \nis written that a restriction on changing the incentives after the contract is entered into may \nbe barred as well.  I do not think it was the sponsors' intent nor, clearly, was it Senator \nLange's intent; I do not think from what we have heard from the proponents that was their \nintent.  I think the language needs to be clarified in that regard. \n \nFinally, I think it would be worthwhile at least to have committee counsel take a look at the \nreference  to  a  third  party  when  we  are  actually  talking  about  a  hospital  or  a \nprovider/physician provider entering into a contract with the payor.  They are counterparties \nto the same contract.  One is not an unrelated third party. The technical elements of this and \neliminating antitrust provisions by themselves are not the problem that we have with this bill.  \nIt is making sure that it is clear and does not impede the open contracting that otherwise \noccurs in this highly competitive environment.  Again, I appreciate the opportunity to testify \nand thank you, Madam Chair. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 57 \n \nKatie Roe Ryan, System Director, Nevada Government Relations, Dignity Health-St. \nRose Dominican: \nDignity Health-St. Rose Dominican is also in opposition to S.B. 329 (R1) for many of the \nreasons already cited by my colleagues.  Anticompetitive practices are not an issue in the \nstate, and if there are any health systems doing this, the Office of the Attorney General can \ndeal with bad actors.  St. Rose also does not mandate that payors contract with our entire \nnetwork.  The contracting restrictions piece of the bill in section 20.9 is severely problematic \nand will make navigating health care coverage even more difficult for patients while also \ncreating access-to-care and quality issues by interrupting the continuum of care.  This could \nalso be harmful to health equity. \n \nThere is nothing in this bill that would prevent payors from making their members go to the \ncheapest place of care and not giving them a choice.  How is this confusion and frustration \nbetter for the patient?  This benefits the payor's bottom line, not the patient.  That being said, \nSt. Rose is willing to work with the sponsor on this bill in conjunction with the Nevada \nHospital Association and hopes we can come to a resolution. \n \nDan Musgrove, representing Valley Health System: \nI will not be repetitive.  George Ross, James Wadhams, and Katie Ryan were excellent in \ntheir comments.  Valley Health System has a number of hospitals in southern Nevada, and \nwe are starting a second hospital in Reno.  We currently have one in Sparks.  As was \ndiscussed, there is something to be said for continuity of care, and I think Mr. Ross captured \nit correctly.  There is an ability for us to go to exactly what Assemblywoman Krasner said.  \nWhen someone shows up at our door in an emergency situation, they want the best of care.  \nWe save insurance systems money by not replicating or [unintelligible] throughout our whole \nsystem or other services where we can easily transfer them within our system and make sure \nthey get the absolute best of care.  Our concern, as has been said, is section 20.9, and we ask \nthat you sincerely consider our suggested amendment.  Thank you for the opportunity to \ntestify. \n \nMisty Grimmer, representing North Vista Hospital: \nThank you, Chair Nguyen, Committee members, and Senator Lange for having an open door \nto working with us on S.B. 329 (R1).  North Vista Hospital is the only hospital in North \nLas Vegas and is in the oldest part of North Las Vegas.  We echo the statements of the other \nhospitals you heard from today, especially Mr. Ross's comments about asking the Legislature \nto stop the cost shifting that happens from Medicaid to commercial payors by increasing \nMedicaid rates.  We are a small hospital compared to others in Las Vegas and have just one \nlocation in Las Vegas; therefore, the ability to have as much flexibility with our contracting \nas possible is very important.  Therefore, we, too, are in opposition to S.B. 329 (R1) as \ncurrently drafted. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 58 \n \nChris Bosse, Chief Government Relations Officer, Renown Health: \nI  am  representing  Renown  Health  in  Reno.    We  appreciate  Senator  Lange  and  the \nrepresentatives of the Culinary Health Fund for initially working with the industry on the bill \nand working to determine if there were unintended consequences that could be corrected in \nthe bill language.  We do, however, oppose S.B. 329 (R1) as amended as the majority of our \nconcerns have not yet been addressed.  Our primary concerns include the following:  We \nbelieve payors and providers should be allowed to negotiate and mutually agree on contract \nterms.  Senate Bill 329 (1st Reprint) prohibits parties from negotiating certain terms that may \nresult in providers not being able to offer their best volume discount if they cannot confirm \nthe payor's members will not be directed away from them.  In addition, as an integrated \ndelivery system, Renown Health provides value to its patients and those employer groups and \npayors we contract with by being able to provide high-quality care in the most cost-effective \nsetting, including this past year during the COVID-19 pandemic where we provided care in \nthe patient's home when it was appropriate. \n \nExcluding  or  steering  patients  around  the  components  of  our  delivery  system  has \nthe potential of diminishing our ability to meet the patient's needs.  By connecting the \ncomponents  of  the  health  care  delivery  system,  we  are  able  to  coordinate  care,  hold \nthe components  of  the  delivery  system  accountable  to  outcomes,  and  improve \ncommunication  between  levels  of  care  and  the  patient.    Senate  Bill  329  (1st  Reprint) \nundermines the components that, nationally, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \nhas encouraged health care delivery systems to build through establishing accountable care  \norganizations which have demonstrated the ability to improve quality and provide care most \ncost  effectively.    As  stated  previously,  we  oppose  the  bill  and  hope  to  be  given  the \nopportunity to work with Senator Lange and the Culinary Health Fund to address these \nconcerns. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIs there further opposition testimony?  [There was none.] \n \n[Exhibit S, a letter in opposition, was submitted but not discussed and will become part of the \nrecord.] \n \nNow I will go to neutral testimony on S.B. 329 (R1).  [There was none.]  I will call \nSenator Lange, our bill sponsor, back up to the table for any closing remarks. \n \nSenator Lange: \nWe have heard a lot today, and you are all right:  This is a very complex bill.  We would not \nbring this bill to you if there have not been reasons for it.  We continue to work with the \nhospitals who are the people who seem to have the most problems with the bill.  We are \ngoing to work to amend the bill to include Optum and groups like that to make sure they have \nthe same reporting requirements as other groups.  Mr. Ross and I talked about that earlier in \nthe week.  We just wanted to make sure we could get the bill to you in a timely manner. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 5, 2021 \nPage 59 \n \nToday, you heard from legal counsel that the felony is not something we wanted to add in; it \nis something already in statute that is applicable to this language as well.  We also know that \nthe Office of the Attorney General deals with monopolies and can go after them.  We want to \nbe able to give the Attorney General some teeth into antitrust stuff that is happening or that \ncould happen in our health care system in Nevada.  That is why legislative language and \n[unintelligible] statute is so important in this bill.  We are open to any questions you might \nhave.  If you are thinking about it at night and you come up with something, feel free to send \nme an email.  I am happy to connect you with any of the presenters, and I thank you for \nyour time. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you, Senator Lange, and thank you, Committee.  You were very patient and so \nattentive to the bills that were presented before us.  With that, I will close the hearing on \nS.B. 329 (R1), and we will move to public comment.  [There was none.]  With that, I will \nclose public comment and open up for comments from Committee members.

Committee rules and protocol were explained.]  We have one bill hearing.  \nWe will open the hearing on Senate Bill 5 (1st Reprint). \n \nSenate Bill 5 (1st Reprint):  Makes changes relating to telehealth. (BDR 40-416) \n \nSara Cholhagian, Executive Director, Patient Protection Commission, Office of the \nGovernor: \nJoining  me  for  this  presentation  are  Deputy  Attorney  General  Greg  Ott  and  Deputy \nAdministrator DuAne Young from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).  \nIt  is  an  honor  to  come  before  you  today  to  present  Senate  Bill  5  (1st  Reprint)  which \noriginated as a recommendation for the Patient Protection Commission within the Office of \nthe Governor as one of its priorities for the legislative session.  The goal of this measure is to \npromote increased access to care and to make into law telehealth flexibilities that were \ngranted during the COVID-19 public health emergency.  This bill is an effort to recognize \nlong-term recovery and a new normal for patient access to care.   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 7, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nI will start by providing an overview of the main provisions of the bill.  I am happy to take \nany questions or go section by section if that is preferred.  Chair Nguyen, if it is permissible, \nI will start with the first provision, relating to equitable access. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThat sounds good. \n \nSara Cholhagian: \nSections 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 relate to equitable access.  They require DHHS, to the extent that \nresources are available, to establish a data dashboard that allows analysis of data relating to \naccess to telehealth by different groups and populations in this state.  Section 1, subsection 2, \noutlines those parameters for the dashboard.  There are no provisions relating to a mandated \ndata collection effort; rather, the intent is to utilize existing data.  This is a first step to \nmeasure telehealth access.  There is a requirement in section 2, subsection 1, paragraph (h), \nfor  the  state  to  review  the  dashboard  and  evaluate  policies  to  make  such  access  more \nequitable.  This is also required for other health policy boards in the state, specifically the \nCommission  on  Behavioral  Health  and  the  Regional  Behavioral  Health  Policy  Boards.  \nIn addition, there is also a provision that requires both DHHS and the Patient Protection \nCommission to make this data dashboard publicly available, posted on their website for \npublic access and viewing. \n \nI will pause to take any questions related to equitable access, unless you would like me to \nmove on to the second part of this measure, which is related to the expansion of services. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe will take a short recess [at 1:08 p.m.].  I will call the Committee back to order [at \n1:08 p.m.].  Ms. Cholhagian, would you do your entire presentation?  We will ask questions \nat the end.  I know there has been some talk about an amendment.  I do not know if that is a \nnew amendment, or if that is miscommunication.   \n \nSara Cholhagian: \nI will proceed with the remainder of the presentation that outlines the intent of this measure.  \nWhen I conclude, I will highlight what the adopted amendment from the Senate did and \nwhere it stands.  The adopted amendment did not change the intent of the outline of this \nmeasure. \n \nThe second part of this measure relates to expansion of services and access.  Primarily, \nsections 4 and 8 through 16 compel private payers to reimburse providers on the same basis \nas the insurer provides coverage and reimbursement for health care services provided in \nperson.  Medicaid is already required to reimburse providers.  Audio-only service is excluded \nfrom  this  reimbursement  provision,  but  the  technology  is  recognized  as  an  allowable \nmodality.  The Commission voted to recognize that reimbursement should be kept on par \nwith in-person care to give reluctant providers a reason to try telehealth and spur widespread \nadoption with the goal of increasing access.  This legislation will encourage providers and \npatients to use virtual care alternatives to increase access to care. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 7, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nAs Chair Nguyen mentioned, the reprinted version of the bill includes Amendment 174, \nwhich was adopted and voted out unanimously by the Senate.  It includes several provisions.  \nThere was an amendment from DHHS removing their fiscal concern related to the creation of \nthe data dashboard, providing clarity there was no intent to have an unfunded mandate and \nrecognizing there are resources the Department needs to have available in order to comply \nwith this request.  The adopted amendment addresses their fiscal concerns, and there is no \nfiscal impact to the state considered on this measure.   \n \nThe other four adopted amendments include a revision of the definition of \"telehealth,\" to \nprovide that the term includes, without limitation, the delivery of services from a provider of \nhealth  care  to  a  patient  at  a  different  location  through  the  use  of  synchronous  and \nasynchronous  store-and-forward  interaction.    The  second  amendment  replaced  the  term \n\"standard telephone\" to reference \"audio-only.\"  The third one is a provision that prohibits \nhealth professional licensing boards from prohibiting licensees from establishing a patient-\nprovider relationship via telehealth when it is clinically appropriate to do so and authorizes \nthe State Board of Health of the Department of Health and Human Services to establish \nregulations prescribing requirements governing a process of establishing a patient-provider \nrelationship via telehealth.  That new provision can be found in section 8, subsection 4.  The \nfourth amendment was an attempt to carve out workers' compensation from this mandate.  \nThere was no focus in the Commission's deliberations on workers' compensation; instead, it \nwas an inclusion from the drafting decision.  In a conceptual amendment, Chair Julia Ratti \nrequested to remove provisions related to workers' compensation to comply—to carve them \nout of the requirement for payment parity.   \n \nThat concludes my remarks. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre Mr. Ott and Mr. Young available for questions?  I see them nodding their heads.  I will \ngo to members' questions. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nIn section 1, subsection 1, paragraph (a), subparagraph (2), the data dashboard must \"allow \nfor the user . . . .\"  Who would the user be? \n \nSara Cholhagian: \nThe user, in this context, is a member of the public.  The intent is to have this publicly \ndisplayed, and the user would be the public.   \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nSection 1, subsection 2, paragraph (a), subparagraph (1), says that the dashboard shall have \nrelevant information.  What is considered \"relevant?\"  Who will determine what \"relevant \ninformation\" is? \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 7, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nSara Cholhagian: \nI will do my best to answer this.  Kyra Morgan, the Chief Biostatistician in the Division of \nPublic and Behavioral Health in DHHS, will be heading this effort as a part of the Office of \nAnalytics.  She was not able to join us today.  If I cannot answer this, I will follow up with \nyou.  My understanding is that the relevant information would be their interpretation of the \nrequirements outlined in this bill in section 1, subsection 2.   \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nIn section 2, subsection 1, paragraph (h), what does it mean \"to make such access more \nequitable\"?  Is it access to the dashboard?  Is it access to telehealth?  Is it access to health \ncare in general?  What access needs to be more equitable? \n \nSara Cholhagian: \nRegarding the intent around this request for equitable access, the Commission wanted to \nmake sure they address vulnerable populations that may not have great access to telehealth \nservices.  When you talk about the reference \"to make such access more equitable,\" it means \nthat if the data shows vulnerable populations or service areas with lower utilization rates, the \nDepartment must consider how to make those areas more equitable. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThe reason I am asking these questions is, I am not sure where in the bill you decide what is \nrelevant.  The public goes on as the user.  You have someone who is the user, but somebody \nelse is collecting the data.  With that data, is this platform somehow going to make health \ncare more equitable?  I do not see that pattern. \n \nMy next question is regarding section 4, subsection 1, paragraph (a).  In your presentation, \nyou mentioned you would not include audio-only.  In telehealth for mental health, we were \nlooking at more access.  It has been a real issue.  You are not recognizing we may need to \nhave the availability of just audio.  Not everyone has a phone with FaceTime for visual \naccess.  Not everybody has a computer.  Sometimes, all they have is access to a landline \nphone, especially in my rural areas where we frequently do not have access to the Internet.  \nI am curious why you would exclude the audio-only component.   \n \nSara Cholhagian: \nI will take the first part and reference the provision about users and looking at the data.  That \nis aimed more as a public awareness and transparency effort to make sure the user has the \nability to look at these policies and to keep policy and its consequences in the public eye.  \nWhen you look at the review part in section 2, subsection 1(h), the key component of that is \nto review access and make sure, after the Department reviews access, they consider those \nevaluations in their policymaking decisions.  The component for the user is to see it is a \ntransparency effort to keep the public involved and aware of those decisions. \n \nWhen it comes to audio-only and having a carve-out, you are absolutely right about making \nsure that there is continued access for the patient to be able to use the telephone, which is \nwhy the Commission voted to allow for audio-only to be preserved access as an allowable \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 7, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \ntechnology.  It just did not recognize it as an adequate platform to provide proper health care \nservices like changing the standards.  I think there was some discussion around whether it \nwarrants  the  same  reimbursement  level.    There  was  not  enough  comfort  with  the \ncommissioners'  deliberation  to  say  that  they  must  include  audio-only  as  a  part  of  the \nreimbursement mechanism, but they definitely wanted it, to contain access and allow it for a \nrecognized modality. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nIn  your  opening  statement,  you  talked  about  having  parity  with  paying  the  telehealth \nproviders  with  the  brick-and-mortar  providers  because  you  wanted  to  encourage  more \nproviders to use telehealth so that, hopefully, you would increase access.  This is my fourth \nsession.  At every session and in my career, I have advocated for access to health care.  I am \non board with that.  I also understand the disparity in health care and those who are not able \nto seek health care.  That is frequently out in the rural areas.  Telehealth makes it helpful.  \nI support the telehealth concept and have used it, especially for psychiatric patients.  My \nconcern is about offering parity in reimbursement for telehealth providers versus brick-and-\nmortar providers.  In the contract world of health care, when you negotiate a contract with \nproviders, you set what you are going to reimburse a provider.  I am concerned about paying \nthe  same  rate  to  telehealth  providers  and  the  brick-and-mortar  person  who  stayed  in  a \ncommunity and has tried to survive under health care regulations.  The telehealth provider \nhas no investment in the community and does not have to pay employees in the community.  \nI am worried that, in the long run, you might do the opposite of what you are trying to do—\ncreate access to care—if telehealth becomes the only access to health care because you \npushed everybody else out of business.  I am concerned about the parity of reimbursement \npiece and how that will shape up for those providers who have dedicated their lives living in \na community.  \n \nSara Cholhagian: \nI am not sure if there was a question.  I do not know how to respond to that.  During the \nCommission's  deliberations,  their  focus  was  driven  on  increased  access  and  providing \nanother alternative delivery model for patients to receive services.  There was not a deep \ndiscussion  or  deliberation  on  modifying  brick-and-mortar  businesses  or  changing  the \neconomics of some of the other smaller providers.  It was around, How can we provide \nanother option to make sure that increased access is here to stay? \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nAgain, that is per other discussions we have had on a bill we heard just the other day about \nmedical practices aligning and people leaving and signing into big groups.  Part of this is the \nglobal discussion of how we really access care and all these little things that chip away at \nthat.  I just wanted to bring it to your attention.   \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nI would like to ask a different question regarding audio-only.  In the Assembly Committee on \nJudiciary, we had a bill about the police being able to use a telephone, an iPad, or some type \nof electronic device to have a person in crisis speak to someone who provided emotional \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 7, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \ncounseling.  Part of that bill was not just that they talk on an iPad, but that they might be able \nto hold a phone up to someone and have them get some counseling.  Would the audio-only \nexclusion affect that?  That is a very important portion of the calls made by a Mobile \nOutreach Safety Team (MOST).  In my community where we have many providers of \nhomeless care and mental health services, we do not want an inadvertent conflict with those \nteams not being able to provide that service.  Would you please respond?  \n \nSara Cholhagian: \nI understand and am empathetic to your concern.  To give you some comfort, the audio-only \ncarve-out is specifically related to the reimbursement provision.  There is no restriction on \nthe use of that modality to provide service.  It is only meant for the reimbursement portion on \nthe providers and payers, but not for the utilization of an audio service modality. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nWould  you  please  explain  that  a  bit  more?    You  are  saying  it  only  applies  to  the \nreimbursement portion.  If the police are contracting with an organization to provide these \nservices and they are being reimbursed by Medicaid—I do not know if they are, but if they \nwere—could this interfere with that? \n \nSara Cholhagian: \nWhat I meant by \"the reimbursement portion\" is there is no mandated requirement that it \nmust be paid in parity with in-person care.  This means that it can be billed and reimbursed; it \ndoes not mean that it is automatically mandated at the same level as in-person care.  It would \nwarrant reimbursement at the flexibility of the payer and provider discussion.  It can still be \nallowed; it is just not a mandate that it is reimbursed at the same rate as in-person service.  \nPerhaps, for more clarity, Deputy Administrator DuAne Young could explain that from the \nstate side so you can see how that reimbursement would work. \n \nDuAne Young, Deputy Administrator, Division of Health Care Financing and Policy, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services: \nI will give a little bit of history so that we can put this on the legislative record in this house \nas we did in the Senate.  When we first went down this path to put this legislation forward, \nworking  with  the  Patient  Protection  Commission,  we  determined  that  the  Centers  for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) had not made a ruling if audio-only communications \nfor telehealth would continue outside of the public health emergency as they have been under \nthe public health emergency.  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has now \nruled that if a provider is able to maintain the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability \nAct (HIPAA) and reasonable efforts of privacy, audio-only is included under the definition \nwithin the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification, for \nthe purposes of CMS reimbursement for telehealth.  As it is, Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) \nChapter  422,  as  outlined  within  this  bill,  does  not  change.    Medicaid  already  had \nreimbursement parity for telehealth and in-person services.  This provision allows some \nguardrails for audio-only communication, meaning that, even though the Division has been \npaying at parity for audio-only communication through the public health emergency, if we \nwere to ever get into an economic crisis or needed to adjust Medicaid's budget, we would not \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 7, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nhave to pay for parity for telephone-only calls and could adjust the fee schedule and cost-\nbased providers if necessary.  These are appropriate guardrails.  Other legislation being \nconsidered would expand audio-only.  For that, the Division has placed a fiscal note because \nof the increased utilization the Division would see for audio-only, so this is an appropriate \nguardrail as the language is written now to keep that utilization and allow the Division the \nlevers that it already had in NRS Chapter 422.   \n \nTo go back to Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong's question regarding crisis services, \naudio-only  crisis  behavioral  health  services  are  and  have  always  been  allowed  through \nMedicaid policies.  When a person is in a behavioral health crisis and calls a crisis line to \nspeak  with  an  enrolled  professional,  the  professional  can  bill  Medicaid  for  the  crisis \nintervention.  Those services are allowed.  On these platforms, MOST officers were able, \neven before the pandemic, to bill for those services and would be able to continue to do so.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any follow-up questions? \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nNo.  I appreciate this history and in-depth explanation because this is very concerning to \nmany of us.  We hear things in different houses and committees, and then you see there is a \nnexus.  I just want to make sure that I am not making a mistake when I push the button.  \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nOn the parity of reimbursement, I understand the goal of encouraging providers to use \ntelehealth, so that makes sense.  On the other hand, I can see that the cost of providing \ntelehealth services is lower than on-site services, so we might get into an over-reimbursement \nsetting.  If it turns out, after a couple of years, people and providers have gotten used to it and \nare willing, we have solved the access problem, but now we might have transitioned to an \nover-reimbursement.  Would we have to come as a Legislature to amend this?  Is there a way \nto give some sort of authority to eliminate it or sunset it without having to come back to the \nLegislature? \n \nSara Cholhagian: \nI would defer to our attorney to answer your legal question.  I would be hesitant to try to \nrespond to something that is legal and technical in nature. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nMs. O'Krent, are you on the line and able to respond, or do you need additional time to do \nsome research? \n \nKarly O'Krent, Committee Counsel: \nI can answer that question now.  As the bill is currently drafted, they would have to come \nback and change those provisions to adjust the reimbursement rates. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 7, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nIf there is a way for us to revise this now so we can give some kind of ability to change this \nwithout having to change the statute, it would be worth considering. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAssemblyman Orentlicher, do you have any other follow-up questions? \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nNo. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nI have questions related to the intention of certain language.  The first is a clarifying question \nabout the data privacy and security of the dashboard, ensuring it meets with confidentiality \nstandards and all of that.  I wanted to make sure to get that on the record.  The other piece is \nthe definition of \"different groups and populations\" as mentioned in section 1, subsection 1, \nparagraph (a).  It looks to me as if you outlined some of that in section 1, subsection 1, \nparagraph (a), subparagraph (2), but I want to make sure we have a clear understanding of \nwhat your intention of reviewing the access for different groups and populations means. \n \nSara Cholhagian: \nI will defer to Kyra Morgan for additional follow-up.  I will answer to the best of my ability.  \nBecause there are no mandated new data collection requirements in this bill, all the privacy \nand concerns are already embedded in their current operations and process and would align.  \nThe data dashboard is intended to be created utilizing existing resources.  The security would \nfollow what is already in place.  To answer your question about the different demographics, \nthe Commission wanted to make sure they captured all the right demographics to look at any \npotential vulnerable population.  That language was provided by drafting, so the specifics of \nthat and the feedback I received from Commission members were generally in agreement \nthat it captured their intent.  I have not heard any negative feedback about those parameters. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nI would appreciate it if any follow-up information could come to the Committee so we can all \nsee it.   \n \nMy next question has to do with the second part of the bill.  In your definition of \"telehealth\" \nin section 7, subsection 6, paragraph (d), you use the word \"audio-visual.\"  Do you mean that \ntelehealth is only reimbursable if it uses both the audio and the visual mechanisms?  I did a \ntelehealth call and my video was on the wrong side of my computer.  I was watching the \nscreen and did not have the video on me.  In that case, I did not have audio-visual interaction.  \nDo you mean the best attempt at that?  I just want to make sure we are not accidentally \nexcluding certain practices or incidental actions—if someone is blind and cannot see the \nvideo, if someone is deaf and needs to use the texting mechanism of Zoom, those kinds of \nthings.   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 7, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nSara Cholhagian: \nI will ask Deputy Administrator Young to opine on this part.  I can tell you that the intent of \nthe definition was to be all-inclusive of all the appropriate modalities.  There was not an \nattempt to exclude any one technology, but I will defer to him to explain that in a more \npractical way than I can address. \n \nDuAne Young: \nThe intent and the language in NRS Chapter 422 originally focused on the audio-visual \nimpact of telehealth.  As I mentioned earlier, audio-only was allowed only in instances of a \nbehavioral health crisis or case management, not through other means.  Since then, during the \npublic health emergency, audio-only has been allowed.  This language was crafted as a \nresponse to fix state law but not supersede federal law.  The regulation through the Office for \nCivil Rights within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has been reversed \nand CMS has reversed course, so audio-only is allowable.  This language only speaks to the \nreimbursement portion, but it does encapsulate existing language, the framework of NRS \nChapter 422, and the new provision for audio-only as allowable by the federal government. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nThis question has to do with section 8, establishing regulations that allow a doctor and patient \nrelationship via telehealth.  Are there existing models of this in other states, or are we \ncreating something from scratch with those regulations? \n \nSara Cholhagian: \nI do not believe Nevada is creating anything new.  The addition of the proposed amendment \nwas provided through discussions with the American Telemedicine Association and Teladoc \nHealth.  I would like to get back to you to make sure I answer correctly.  I believe this was \nmodel language provided through the American Telemedicine Association for Nevada to \nconsider. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nI was thinking about the time it takes to adopt regulations and if the drafting came up with \nbrand-new language that was never used before.  I wondered about the timeline for that, but \nit sounds like we may have something to start with while getting into that regulatory process.   \n \nAssemblyman Matthews: \nI have a question on broadband access, as there is limited broadband in some cases.  Will we \nbe looking at the limits on broadband for our urban and rural areas since this might be a \ndeterrent to access to telehealth in some cases?  To what extent might you try to address that? \n \nSara Cholhagian: \nThat  was  a  part  of  the  deliberations  of  the  Commission  when  they  started  discussing \nequitable access, asking what they could do to improve broadband access to vulnerable \npopulations.  Being mindful of the economic climate at the time, they did not want to put \nforth a measure that created an unfunded mandate to increase broadband access.  They \nexpressed their intent to try to increase access where appropriate.  In this piece of legislation, \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 7, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nyou will see answers may be found as soon as you start to collect some of the telehealth \naccess and data and provide for the dashboard.  It might be part of the conversation to see if \nthere is an opportunity to identify certain vulnerable populations that could benefit from \nincreased broadband access and resources dedicated to those areas. \n \nAssemblyman Matthews: \nTo make sure I understand, it is part of the data collection.  You anticipate that will include \ndata on the need for providers and access to make sure we can provide these services in some \ninstances.  Do I understand you correctly?  Will part of the data collection address that? \n \nSara Cholhagian: \nYes, but not necessarily data collection; it would be more data analysis.  They are going to \nuse data they already have and are already collecting in the state, but they will analyze access \npoints and identify vulnerable populations.  I think in discussions of potential solutions for \nfurther policies the thought about increased broadband to enhance equitable access would be \na part of the deliberations. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI appreciate the ability to make sure we do this right.  In section 4, subsection 1, it states, \n\"The Director shall. . . .\"  We are talking about the State Plan of Medicaid, so this is just for \nMedicaid.  Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 442 is about child and maternal health.  Will we \nsee this language specific to section 4, subsection 1, paragraph (b), subparagraph (5), on \ncategorizing  the  service  provider  through  telehealth  differently  for  purposes  relating  to \ncoverage  or  reimbursement?    Is  that  going  to  be  specific  to  maternal  and  child  health \nprograms through Medicaid?  It is a short bill.  If we were touching every section of health \ncare, it would be bigger.  Is it only living in that one spot, or is it more comprehensive \nthan that? \n \nSara Cholhagian: \nThe provision you are referencing is the drafting intent to make sure they capture that \ntelehealth is not treated any differently than in-person care.  It lives in that provision under \nchild and maternal health, but it is not specific to just child and maternal health.  Perhaps \nMs. O'Krent could opine on that because I see it as a part of the drafting effort to make sure \nthat telehealth services are not treated any differently than in-person care.  \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI scrolled down further, and I see it also in section 7 and NRS Chapter 616C, where we start \ngetting into the insurance policies.  That is where it is applied across all insurers of health \ncare.  Is that correct? \n \nSara Cholhagian: \nThat  provision  relates  to  workers'  compensation,  and  it  does  not  apply  to  workers' \ncompensation provisions.  You will see there is a separate definition of \"telehealth\" in \nsection 7 of the bill.  The intent for that section is to make sure that provisions requiring \nworkers' compensation to comply with the billed audio-only and payment requirements are \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 7, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nnot applicable to the workers' compensation program, but that provision is applicable to \nevery other insurance carrier in the remaining sections 8 through 16. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI want to make sure I have my status quo right.  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices currently has temporary regulations out through the end of the pandemic that allow \nfor Medicare and Medicaid payment.  I think the one for Medicare is the 1135 waiver.  That \nis the one that is living right now and is going to carry us through the end of the federal \ngovernment's formal emergency declaration.  Through that time, Medicare and Medicaid \nmust have parity and allow for the telehealth services.  Is that right?  I was trying to figure \nout when I was reading the 1135 waiver, is it just billing parity?   \n \nSara Cholhagian: \nI am going to go back to what Deputy Administrator DuAne Young said about Medicaid.  \nIn 2015, Medicaid payment parity was codified into law.  They already pay in parity.  What \nthe federal waiver did through the public health emergency was allowed reimbursement on \nthe audio-only portion of it.  Should that end, then the state would go back to the parity \nalready in place.  There is no modification to state Medicaid. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI am trying to figure out what the change is.  We brought the bill to create a change.  I see \ninterested groups bringing amendments to this change.  Obviously, there is a big shift.  There \nis enough interest in this that it is a big shift.  The other piece I was trying to figure out is that \nwith the waiver, CMS was not going to audit for the clinician-patient relationship that had \nbeen established prior to using telehealth.  We are going to say that we will allow the \nclinician-patient relationship to be established by regulations, and we are going to tell boards \nnot to have a dozen different standards for a dozen different boards.  Is that the bigger change \nhere?    I  am  trying  to  figure  out  why  we  have  these  big  national  groups  submitting \namendments  to  Nevada  legislation.    It  would  not  matter  if  we  were  not  changing  it \nsubstantially, so I am trying to make sure what health care is going to look like in my state a \nyear from now. \n \nSara Cholhagian: \nThere are two parts to that.  First, we are going to go back to one of the larger provisions of \nthis bill relating to reimbursement that compels private payers to reimburse on the same level \nas  they  provide  for  in-person  services.    Parity  laws  were  established  in  2015,  but  the \nreimbursement portion only applied to state Medicaid.  This bill compels private payers to \nreimburse on the same basis as providing health care services in person.  That is the bigger \nchange for the private payers.  There is not a modification for the state because they already \npay in parity.   \n \nSecond, the modification related to the health professionals' licensing boards got national \nattention and was about making sure that you protect access to care so the patient-provider \nrelationship could still be, if clinically appropriate, allowed to be established via telehealth.  \nIt happens in practice; that provision makes sure there is nothing in law that could prevent it \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 7, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nfrom happening.  That maintains alternative access for patients through telehealth services \nand is about being able to establish that relationship.   \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nIn my initial quick read, I had it backwards.  When I said I wanted to figure out the status quo \non  parity  between  brick-and-mortar  versus  telehealth,  I  was  thinking  it  was  pieces  of \nMedicaid, but not all of Medicaid.  That is where we saw the references to the statute on \nchild and maternal health.  I also see statutes on private insurance, so it is the reverse of what \nI thought.  Medicaid is doing it, but private insurance plans are not required to do it.  That is \na significant change.   \n \nAssemblywoman Titus and I were both in the building when we had the initial hearings on \nwhether we would do telehealth.  Some thought the sky would fall if we did telehealth or that \nwe would have horrible care.  Ultimately, it was a way to go.  For areas of our state, \ntelehealth made sense.  The conversation was always about telehealth as a supplement; the \ngold standard of care is to get in through the door and see a physician.  If that cannot happen \nor  where  that  cannot  happen,  then  you  have  telehealth.    That  is  the  way  it  has  been \nconceptualized in statute.  From my perspective, if we are going to mandate all insurers with \nthe parity piece combined with talking about a patient-client relationship, we are drastically \nchanging how health care will look in this state.  I wanted to make sure I understood.  The \ndata collection is great and fine, but I worry about those two pieces coming together at once, \nand I worry about how that will impact our health care market.   \n \nTo Assemblywoman Titus' point, we were talking about having worked in health care.  \nTen years ago, I worked for a tiny hospital where there were still nuns providing health care.  \nThen the nuns got kicked out.  Then it got sold.  Then it was owned by a western-market \nconglomerate.  Then a year and a half later, it was sold and went to a western United States \ncorporation, and now it is a national corporation.  I have seen that acquisition of health care.  \nI have lived that acquisition of health care where every year and a half they say, We will \nkeep the name the same so people in the community recognize the name and think we are the \nsame, but the ownership is constantly changing.  It is always going broader and up, it is not \ndevolving.  I wonder what this will look like for telehealth when we say health care can be \nprovided by an investor group that is managing a telehealth corporation.  That is my thought.   \n \nSara Cholhagian: \nI  appreciate  your  perspective  and understanding  of  the  future.   You  do  have  a  correct \nunderstanding of this piece of legislation.  This is their attempt for a long-term recovery of \nthe new normal and making sure the goal was patient access to care and having virtual \nalternatives to increase that access.  You do have a correct understanding of the intent of this \nlegislation. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo you have any other follow-up questions? \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 7, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nNo.  I appreciate that and the ability to make sure I was thinking about it correctly.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI was going to go to Assemblywoman Krasner, but Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong \nhas a follow-up question related to what Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson asked. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nThis is a good segue to ask on the record the question you and I discussed previously.  If we \nhave a provider who is only providing telehealth and does not have a brick-and-mortar \nlocation in Nevada, and a patient who does not want health care through telehealth is referred \nto him, now where are we?  We are placing a patient in a situation of not being in control of \nhow their health care is delivered.  That needs to be considered.  I would like you to speak to \nthat because it really concerns me.  What if that person wants health care in person, and the \ndoctor tells them, I do not do that, or, You will have to wait because my new normal mode is \ntelehealth?  What happens to that patient?  How will it increase access if they may not have \nan option? \n \nSara Cholhagian: \nI appreciate your perspective and understand your concerns.  This piece of legislation is \naimed at providing access to care and giving patients alternative methods of delivery.  For \nyour scenario in which there may be a mandate from the provider to a patient that says they \nonly are available via telehealth or in person, that is a valid concern.  However, this piece of \nlegislation  does  not  address  any  of  those  mandates.    It  just  provides  another  option.  \nIt maintains patients' ability to have an alternative method of accessing care. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nI understand that is your intent, but we know that when we do not have clearly defined \nparameters, people will use their own judgment.  We could very well see that the patient \nloses control and that the doctors or whomever they work for do the compelling about how \nservice is delivered based upon profit and not based upon the best use and the best situation \nfor their patients.  As legislators, we are not in a position to allow people's good nature to \ndrive what they do because we all know that is not what happens in reality.  Oftentimes, it is \ncorporate governance and profits that do. \n \nAssemblywoman Krasner: \nI have a few questions.  The bill expands telehealth from audio-visual and emergency audio \nto now include audio-only, but the bill will not allow Medicaid to pay in parity for audio-\nonly interactions with health care providers if there is not enough money to do so.  Is that \ncorrect? \n \nSara Cholhagian: \nThat is not correct.  There is not an expansion of services or an expansion of a different \nmodality.  I think your question relates to the reimbursement from the state on the audio-\nonly.  Deputy Administrator DuAne Young explained it and would be better equipped to \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 7, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nanswer your concern.  I think your question is related to the reimbursement of audio-only \nfrom the state perspective. \n \nAssemblywoman Krasner: \nYes, it is. \n \nDuAne Young: \nI want to clarify in plain language:  The existing parity for telehealth in NRS Chapter 422 \nwas established in 2015 by the Legislature [Assembly Bill 292 of the 78th Session].  There \nwas one provision of NRS Chapter 422 in that legislation that prohibited audio-only because \nthere was a federal Medicaid provision through the U.S. Department of Health and Human \nServices  Office  for  Civil  Rights  that  did  not  allow  audio-only  or  HIPAA-compliant \nplatforms.  During the public health emergency, the Trump Administration lifted that ban on \naudio-only as a promotion.  Then CMS came back and said we did not have the authority to \ndo that because we did not get permission from the Office for Civil Rights to do so.  Under \nthe Biden Administration, the Office for Civil Rights did not change the regulation; however, \nthey  formally  changed  the  interpretation  behind  that  regulation  that  said  audio-only  is \nincluded for telehealth as long as the provider can maintain reasonable privacy standards.  \nThat reversed the CMS's course to say it is allowable for reimbursement from the federal \ngovernment for Medicaid services. \n \nThe language in this chapter removes that state provision so that it is allowable beyond the \npublic health emergency.  It also establishes through that one clause that Medicaid could and \nstill does pay parity for audio-only communications, so it does not tie our hands.   \n \nTo  speak  to  Assemblywoman  Summers-Armstrong's  point  about  quality  of  care,  we  at \nMedicaid know that while we do our due diligence to gatekeep those providers, there are \nproviders who would set up shop and not effectively provide care.  We would be chasing \nthose providers to make sure they uphold the standard of quality of care and are stewards of \nthe state's and the federal government's resources.  Not changing the existing language and \nallowing for a nonpayment parity allows us appropriate guardrails so we would not have to \nput a fiscal note on this.  We would be able to control utilization, and it would allow us to say \na provider must meet those standards of care and ensure they are serving the patients of \nNevada as they are claiming to do. \n \nAssemblywoman Krasner: \nBack to my question:  If a health care provider provides the initial consultation with the \npatient through audio-only and through telehealth, and if Medicaid is not going to have to \npay parity if there is not money to do so for audio-only, why would a health care provider \neven do this?  Why would you expect a health care provider to do this knowing they might \nnot get paid for their services? \n \nDuAne Young: \nThere would be payment.  It may not be the same level of payment as if they were providing \ntraditional telehealth.  In establishing the policy based on the Legislature's decision in 2015, \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 7, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nwe knew there were some infrastructure costs in telehealth, so I believe that is the reason the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services and Medicaid services supported the provision \nwithout an extended fiscal note.  We knew there were some infrastructure into traditional \ntelehealth equipment.  We have providers who utilize audio-only.  We have been paying \nthem at parity through the public health emergency, but there are some providers that receive \na Prospective Payment System (PPS) encounter rate.  We have been paying them at parity \nthrough  the  public  health  emergency,  but  there  are  some  providers  who  receive  PPS \nencounter rates that are based on their costs.  There are other providers who receive rates that \nare based solely on their costs.  We know that audio-only has a lesser cost than traditional \ntelehealth equipment or the infrastructure of full brick-and-mortar, so if those costs were to \nreduce, this would give us the flexibility to make adjustments based on their reduced costs.  \nIt is not to discourage providers from doing audio-only, but it does allow the provider to \ndecide if the reimbursement is lowered at some point.  They could make that business \ndecision if it is advantageous for them.  It also gives the state the leverage it needs within \nMedicaid policy to control the guardrails appropriately so we do not have to come back \nbefore  the  body  of  the  Legislature  to  say  we  reached  a  shortfall;  we  can  control  the \nmechanisms within policy to have those appropriate fiscal and policy guardrails.   \n \nAssemblywoman Krasner: \nI respectfully disagree with you.  Furthermore, does a health care provider who provides \nservices to somebody via telehealth get sued for any less amount for medical malpractice?  \nOr are they also going to get sued for malpractice and then not be reimbursed by Medicaid in \nparity with this bill? \n \nDuAne Young: \nI am not equipped to answer a medical malpractice question.  I do not practice law.  I will \ndefer to either Mr. Ott or Ms. O'Krent. \n \nGregory D. Ott, Chief Deputy Attorney General, Patient Protection Commission, Office \nof the Governor: \nI would prefer you go to Ms. O'Krent. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nMs. O'Krent, are you able to answer the question, or will you need to follow up with \nAssemblywoman Krasner? \n \nKarly O'Krent: \nI will need to follow up and am happy to do that.  I will send any information necessary to \nthe Committee. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAssemblywoman Krasner, Ms. O'Krent will follow up with you.  Do you have any further \nquestions? \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 7, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nAssemblywoman Krasner: \nNo.  I think this is bad policy.  I do not think we would expect any other profession to not be \npaid in parity for doing their services in an alternate fashion when there is a need for such in \nthat state, and we have already established there is a desperate need in this state. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThis is a very important discussion we are having.  I am looking to see if there are additional \nquestions.  Some people may have additional follow-up questions they want to ask to get on \nthe record.  [There were no additional questions.]  We will begin testimony in support, \nopposition, and neutral on Senate Bill 5 (1st Reprint).   \n \nNancy Bowen, Chief Executive Officer, Nevada Primary Care Association:  \nThe  Nevada  Primary  Care  Association  represents  the  state's  Federally  Qualified  Health \nCenters.  I am here in full support of S.B. 5 (R1).  Our members provide integrated primary, \nbehavioral, and dental health care to more than 107,000 Nevadans.  The vast majority come \nfrom low-income households and are uninsured or on Medicaid.  During the public health \nemergency, between 15 percent and 40 percent of health center visits have taken place over \nthe phone.  Our members found that patients did not always have access to devices and data \nplans that allowed for video telehealth visits.  At first, these remote visits served to keep our \npatients and providers safe and to conserve scarce personal protective equipment.  However, \nas many of us have found with video telehealth, other benefits soon became apparent.  \nPatients took less time off work, did not have to arrange for child care, and were spared long \ntrips on public transportation.   \n \nPatients agree this is an important tool to increase access to care.  One health center patient \nsaid she would not be here today without audio-only visits.  Another credited this modality \nwith helping to manage their chronic disease and keep them out of the emergency room.  \nThese audio-only services have been reimbursed by Medicaid throughout the public health \nemergency.  Allowing the benefit to expire would be taking existing access away from our \nmost vulnerable sick residents.  We urge the Committee to pass S.B. 5 (R1) to address this \nimportant issue. \n \nKristyn Leonard, representing Nevada Advanced Practice Nurses Association: \nThe Nevada Advanced Practice Nurses Association wants to put its support for S.B. 5 (R1) \non the record because ensuring the availability of telehealth services is vital to increasing \naccess to health care in the state.   \n \nMarcus Conklin, representing Teladoc Health: \nWe want to thank the Patient Protection Commission, Sara Cholhagian, and Chair Ratti for \nworking diligently on this issue with us over these past four months.  We are in full support \nof the bill.  We urge passage. \n \nHailey Lindsley, representing Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada: \nPlanned Parenthood Votes Nevada is in favor of S.B. 5 (R1) because making telehealth \naccessible through the standard telephone would be a long-term investment in the health, \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 7, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nsafety, and well-being of Nevadans.  Not only does telemedicine help connect geographically \nisolated areas to vitally important health care, but it is also an essential tool in addressing the \nhealth disparities that exist for Black, Indigenous, and People of Color, rural, and medically \nunderserved communities.  In fact, the removal of restrictions and increased public and \nprivate coverage for telemedicine due to COVID-19 have allowed providers to see more \npatients safely and efficiently.  This temporary expansion has provided a demonstration of \nwhat innovative, broadened access to telemedicine can do.  Please, we urge you to support \nS.B. 5 (R1) and expand more equitable health care access for Nevadans.   \n \nAlex Camberos, Administrative Assistant, Battle Born Progress: \nWe support S.B. 5 (R1) because access to health care is a constant struggle for Nevadans.  \nTelehealth has been expanded during the pandemic.  We have seen more Nevadans able to \naccess their doctors via this modality.  Telehealth should be covered, and access should be \nincreased.  We should be using technology to advance and assist Nevadans in accessing the \nhealth care services they desperately need.   \n \nTrey Delap, representing National Alliance on Mental Illness, Nevada: \nThe National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) is a grassroots mental health organization \ndedicated to building better lives for the more than 400,000 Nevadans affected by mental \nhealth concerns.  I want to note a twinge of irony that I am calling in to deliver audio-only \ntestimony via a telephone.  Telephonic testimony was necessitated by the public health crisis, \nand we have adapted for the capabilities of the state and the public.  I am hopeful that the \ninformation I provide now will be treated in parity as if I were delivering it in person.  That is \nwhy S.B. 5 (R1) is so relevant:  because it ensures that we are meeting people where they are, \nbased on current realities, in a manner accessible to all.   \n \nThe National Alliance on Mental Illness believes that public policies and practices should \npromote access to care for people with mental health conditions.  Each year, NAMI Nevada's \nhelpline answers 10,000 calls for information and assistance:  38 percent of the calls come \nfrom families or caregivers for people with mental concerns; 44 percent of the calls come \nfrom individuals inquiring about a variety of topics related to living with a mental health \nconcern;  25  percent  are  regarding  treatments;  and  20  percent  are  regarding  support, \nencouragement, and reassurance.  The NAMI Nevada warmline has served over 600 people \nsince October 2020.  For those impacted by mental health, it is critical that persons be able to \naccess assistance by any means available to them.  For many people, a telephone with audio-\nonly capability may be the only way to access information or support that would mean the \ndifference between life and death.  Senate Bill 5 (1st Reprint) advances an essential piece of \nan effective community-based resource so that all people have access to a basic human \nconnection to get the best information or support at the right time.  We urge your support. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 7, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nChair Nguyen: \n[There were no more callers in support.]   \n \n[Exhibit C was submitted but not discussed and is included as an exhibit for the hearing.]  \n \nWe will now begin testimony in opposition. \n \nTom Clark, representing Nevada Association of Health Plans: \nWe appreciate and have supported the Legislature's telehealth efforts in the past.  We have \ngiven everyone the ability to be innovative with their health care services.  As we continue to \nface the ripple effects of the pandemic, making sure patients can access care is our priority.  \nTelehealth  options  allow  patients  to  do  so  safely,  securely,  and  conveniently  from \neverywhere.  We support the sections of S.B. 5 (R1) that allow for the data dashboard; \nhowever, we oppose the payment parity provisions mandated in Senate Bill 5 (1st Reprint).  \nInsurers must continue to have flexibility to negotiate prices to keep health coverage costs \naffordable.  Telehealth services must be comparable to the services provided in an office \nvisit.  Insurers and providers must be able to establish different reimbursement rates based on \nthe clinical effectiveness and intensity of the visits.  It is important that we can develop \nvalue-based  arrangements  with  providers  by  focusing  on  health  outcomes,  not  just  the \nvolume of services provided.  This bill prohibits insurance companies from doing just that.  \nThe payment parity provisions are contradictory to telehealth cost-effectiveness.  Telehealth \ncan help reduce the cost of using the health care system and reduce provider visits, but not if \nit is mandated that the services be paid at the same rate as an in-person visit. \n \nChair Nguyen: \n[There were no more callers in opposition.]  Is there any testimony in neutral? \n \nJulia  Peek,  M.H.A.,  C.P.M.,  Deputy  Administrator,  Community  Health  Services, \nDivision of Public and Behavioral Health, Department of Health and Human \nServices: \nThe Division has provided testimony in neutral.  Based on Amendment 174, we were able to \nremove our fiscal note, though it is still reflected in the Nevada Electronic Legislative \nInformation System.  My written testimony is reflected as well with a zero dollar State \nGeneral Fund implementation for S.B. 5 (R1) [Exhibit D].   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any other callers in neutral?  [There were none.]  At this time, I will turn it back \nover to presenters for any closing remarks. \n \nSara Cholhagian: \nMy concluding remarks are gratitude to the Committee for giving me the opportunity to \npresent this important measure on behalf of the Patient Protection Commission.  I appreciate \nyour consideration. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 7, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWith that, I will close the hearing on Senate Bill 5 (1st Reprint).  At this time, we will go to \nour last agenda item, public comment.  Is there anyone wishing to provide public comment?  \n[There was no one.]  Are there any comments from members?  [There were none.]  \n \nWe will not be having a Committee hearing on Monday, but I anticipate we will be having a \nmeeting on Wednesday, May 12, 2021.  I anticipate a work session, and if we receive any \nbills on Monday, we could hear them as well.

(BDR 38-320) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \nAs nonpartisan staff, I cannot advocate for or oppose any measures that you will consider \ntoday. \n \n[Patrick Ashton read a description of the bill from the work session document, Exhibit C.]  \nSenate Bill 61 (1st Reprint) was heard on May 3, 2021.  The bill makes various changes to \nthe program for the operation of vending facilities by licensees who are blind.  Among other \nthings, the bill: \n \n•  Requires the Bureau of Services to Persons Who Are Blind or Visually Impaired in \nthe  Rehabilitation  Division  of  the  Department  of  Employment,  Training  and \nRehabilitation to provide certain training and assistance to licensees in the program \nand to those who wish to become licensees; \n \n•  Grants the Bureau the right of first refusal on behalf of licensees with regard to \noperating a vending facility in or on public buildings or property; \n \n•  Authorizes vending facilities to be operated in or on buildings or properties of the \nNevada System of Higher Education, the Nevada State Park system, the Department \nof Corrections, and, under certain conditions, an airport authority or department of \naviation, with the approval of the Bureau and the state agency; \n \n•  Revises  timelines  within  which  state  or  public  entities  must  notify  the  Bureau \nregarding reactivation, leasing, releasing, licensing, or issuing permits to operate \nvending facilities in or on a public building or property as well as notification related \nto new construction, remodeling, leasing, et cetera of public buildings or property; \n \n•  Provides for the election of the Nevada Committee of Vendors Who Are Blind; and \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 12, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \n•  Authorizes the Bureau to enter a contract to establish a vending facility on private \nproperty through which the licensee may pay an incentive to the property owner for \ncertain locations. \n \nThere were no amendments. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nMembers of the Committee, are there any questions?  Seeing none, at this time I would \nentertain a motion to do pass. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  THOMAS  MADE  A  MOTION  TO  DO  PASS \nSENATE BILL 61 (1ST REPRINT). \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  BENITEZ-THOMPSON  SECONDED  THE \nMOTION. \n \nAre there any comments on the motion?  [There were none.] \n \nTHE  MOTION  PASSED.    (ASSEMBLYMEN  BLACK,  HAFEN, \nKRASNER, MATTHEWS, AND TITUS VOTED NO.) \n \nI will assign that floor statement to Assemblywoman Thomas. \n \nNext, we will move to a work session on Senate Bill 275 (1st Reprint). \n \nSenate Bill 275 (1st Reprint):  Revises provisions relating to communicable diseases. \n(BDR 40-220) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \n[Patrick Ashton read a description of the bill from the work session document, Exhibit D.]  \nWe heard Senate Bill 275 (1st Reprint) on May 3, 2021; it makes various changes related to \ncommunicable diseases.  Among other things, the bill: \n \n•  Requires any order issued by a state or local health authority to isolate, quarantine, or \ntreat a person or group of people with a communicable disease in an infectious state \nor to people exposed to such a disease to state the reasons the actions prescribed in \nthe order are the least restrictive means to prevent, suppress, or control the disease; \n \n•  Requires city and county boards of health to adhere to existing procedures under \nwhich the chief medical officer or district health officer may isolate, quarantine, or \ntreat people infected with or exposed to a communicable disease; \n \n•  Requires the chief medical officer or a district health officer to know or suspect that a \ncommunicable disease is in an infectious state and poses a risk to the health of the \npublic before ordering the person with the communicable disease to submit to testing; \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 12, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \n•  Requires the State Board of Health and district boards of health to establish a process \nby which a person may appeal an order to submit to such testing; \n \n•  Prohibits a court from issuing an order necessary for a health authority to order \ninvoluntary treatment without clear and convincing evidence that the person has a \ncommunicable disease in an infectious state and is likely to pose a danger to the \npublic; \n \n•  Sets forth legislative findings that the spread of communicable diseases is a public \nhealth matter that should not be addressed through criminalization; \n \n•  Prohibits health authorities from warning a person against engaging in an occupation \nor accessing a place of public accommodation if a similar order from certain entities \nwould constitute prohibited discrimination against a person with a disability; \n \n•  Makes  it  a  misdemeanor  for  a  person  to  intentionally  transmit  a  communicable \ndisease to another under certain circumstances; \n \n•  Creates  an  affirmative  defense  if  a  person  exposed  to  a  communicable  disease \nthrough prohibited conduct knew the defendant had the disease, knew the conduct \ncould  result  in  transmission,  and  consented  to  engage  in  the  conduct—or  if  the \ndefendant used or attempted to use means to prevent transmission; \n \n•  Repeals provisions making it a category B felony for a person who tested positive for \nhuman  immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV)  to  intentionally,  knowingly,  or  willfully \nengage in conduct in a manner that is intended or likely to transmit the disease.  Such \na person would be guilty of a misdemeanor under certain circumstances; \n \n•  Authorizes a court to order a person or decedent to be tested for a communicable \ndisease upon the petition of certain people only if the court determines there is \nprobable cause to believe the petitioner was likely exposed and testing is necessary to \ndetermine appropriate medical treatment; \n \n•  Requires  information  concerning  testing  for  sexually  transmitted  diseases  to  be \nincluded in the information provided to victims of sexual assault under the Sexual \nAssault Survivors' Bill of Rights; \n \n•  Requires the Legislative Counsel, to the extent practicable, to ensure that people with \nHIV are referred to using language commonly viewed as respectful and to avoid \nduplicative references to HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in Nevada \nRevised Statutes and provides it is the policy of the state to use similar references in \nNevada Administrative Code; \n \n•  Repeals various provisions of existing law related to HIV and people with HIV; and \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 12, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \n•  Reestablishes  the  Advisory  Task  Force  on  HIV  Exposure  Modernization  for  the \n2021-2022 Legislative Interim. \n \nSenator Dallas Harris proposed the attached amendment during the bill hearing, which: \n \n1.  Revises provisions of the bill concerning authorized actions of a board of county \nhealth or a city board of health relating to communicable diseases that pose a risk to \npublic health. \n \n2.  Revises provisions of the bill to require a health authority who knows, suspects, or is \ninformed of the existence of any communicable disease that is at risk of becoming \ninfectious or developing in such a way that it endangers the health of the person with \na communicable disease to conduct an investigation. \n \n3.  Revises provisions of the bill to prohibit a person from making public the name of, or \nother personally identifying information about, a person exposed to a communicable \ndisease who has been investigated by the health authority without the consent of the \nperson. \n \nMembers, there was a request to withdraw the next amendment, which was proposed on \nMay 11, 2021.  In other words, the amendments to section 6 are not up for consideration. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you for that clarification, Mr. Ashton.  Do we have any questions from Committee \nmembers?  Again, I want to make it clear that the second proposed amendment has been \nwithdrawn [pages 35 and 36, Exhibit D].  Seeing none, I would entertain a motion at this \ntime to amend and do pass. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS MADE A MOTION TO AMEND AND DO \nPASS SENATE BILL 275 (1ST REPRINT). \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN GORELOW SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nDo we have any comments on the motion? \n \nAssemblywoman Krasner: \nHIV is the only communicable or sexually transmitted disease for which you must take \nmedication every day of every week of every month for the rest of your life.  Now that we do \nhave treatment for HIV, it is no longer a death sentence; however, it is a life sentence without \nparole.  This bill allows someone who intentionally gives someone else HIV—you, your kid, \nyour grandkids—only to be prosecuted with a misdemeanor.  That is not right.  This should \nbe a felony, and I will be voting no. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any other comments from Committee members? \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 12, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI support the concept of the bill, and I was going to vote in favor of this bill; however, with \nthe amendment, I will now be a no on this bill. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI think we can clarify.  Do you know that the amendment was withdrawn?  Mr. Walker, will \nyou come up to the table?  I want to make sure we are clear about this. \n \nMatt Walker, representing Silver State Equality: \nI spoke with Senator Harris today, and she requested that the Committee consider moving the \nbill with the initial amendment presented.  It is on NELIS [Nevada Electronic Legislative \nInformation System] reflected as the amendment submitted by Alisa Nave-Worth.  Also, the \nhealth district's amendment that was presented at the hearing. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI want to make clear that the amendment was withdrawn and the amendments the bill is \nproceeding on today were as presented in this Committee. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank you for that clarification.  Now that I am looking at the one here, I will still be a no, \nand I am sorry if I did not make this clear at the time of the hearing.  The concept that we are \ngoing to quarantine people who are exposed as opposed to being infectious—I am concerned \nthat this is a bit of an overreach on that particular aspect of it, so I am going to be a no, \nunfortunately. \n \nAssemblyman Hafen: \nI, too, am slightly confused with the amendments that are being withdrawn.  I will be a yes \nout of Committee today, but I would like to reserve my right on the floor. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you, and I will remind Committee members that they can always change their minds \nwhen they vote for things on the floor.  Additionally, I appreciate the heads-up.  Are there \nany other comments from Committee members?   \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nFor clarity, can Mr. Walker tell us what got withdrawn, or what the issue was with the \namendment that has been withdrawn, and why it is an issue today? \n \nMatt Walker: \nThank you for the opportunity to clarify the record.  Amendment #2 submitted by Senator \nDallas Harris [pages 35 and 36, Exhibit D] has been withdrawn today because, in section 6, \nsubsection 4, there was insufficient clarity given on what elements should constitute the \ncrime of transmitting a communicable disease or what other behavior was likely to transmit a \ncommunicable disease.  There was some desire by proponents to see health districts not have \nthe ability to levy a misdemeanor offense if there is a violation of a health order and the \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 12, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nelements of subsection 4 not met.  The health districts, obviously, felt it was very important \nfor them to have some enforcement power and that there be a misdemeanor associated with \nviolating a health order, period.  After a lot of great discussion with your Committee staff and \nthe LCB [Legislative Counsel Bureau], Mr. Patrick Ashton and others, there was simply no \nway to meet in the middle on that language.  As a default, Senator Harris wished to leave the \nstatute as is, leaving both the misdemeanor as defined in subsection 4 and the misdemeanor \nassociated with violating a health order.  Our client, Silver State Equality, is in full support of \nwithdrawing that amendment. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nThank you.  That makes a lot of sense. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI am going to turn this over to Patrick Ashton to also provide some clarifying comments. \n \nPatrick Ashton: \nCommittee  members,  when  you  go  on  NELIS,  you  can  find  the  updated  work  session \ndocument for S.B. 275 (R1).  If you look at the combined work session document that was \nprovided to you yesterday, we only will consider amendments 1, 2, and 3 on the bill [page 2, \nExhibit D] and also the attached amendment that was presented by Senator Harris during the \nbill hearing [pages 3 through 34].  The other amendment [pages 35 and 36] was withdrawn. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any other comments from Committee members at this time?  [There were none.] \n \nTHE  MOTION  PASSED.    (ASSEMBLYMEN  BLACK,  KRASNER, \nMATTHEWS, AND TITUS VOTED NO.) \n \nI will assign that floor statement to Assemblywoman Peters. \n \nNext is Senate Bill 391 (1st Reprint). \n \nSenate Bill 391 (1st Reprint):  Revises provisions relating to dentistry. (BDR 40-455) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \n[Patrick Ashton read a description of the bill from the work session document, Exhibit E.]  \nWe heard Senate Bill 391 (1st Reprint) on May 5, 2021.  The bill provides that the state \ndental health officer is not required to be licensed to practice dentistry in this state if certain \nother criteria are met.  The bill removes a prohibition on the state public health dental \nhygienist pursuing an outside business or vocation, instead authorizing such activity with the \napproval of the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and \nHuman Services.  In addition, the bill authorizes the Board of Dental Examiners to issue a \nlimited license as a dentist or dental hygienist to the state dental health officer or the state \npublic health dental hygienist. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 12, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nSenate Bill 391 (1st Reprint) also authorizes the Division to issue a permit as a dental \nresponder to a dentist, dental hygienist, or dental therapist who has received certain training \nin  emergency  response.    Dental  responders  may  provide  emergency  medical  care, \nimmunizations, medical care in mobile clinics, and humanitarian care during a state of \nemergency, a declaration of disaster, public health emergency, or other health event. \n \nThe bill creates the Committee on Dental Emergency Management within the Division, and it \nprescribes duties of the Committee which relate to emergency management and the practice \nof professions that provide dental care. \n \nFinally,  S.B.  391  (R1)  outlines  requirements  related  to  providing  services  through \nteledentistry and requires hospitals and Medicaid managed care plans or health maintenance \norganizations  to  take  certain  measures  to  improve  access  to  oral  health  care  through \nteledentistry.  There were no amendments. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any questions from Committee members on Senate Bill 391 (1st Reprint)?  \nSeeing none, I will entertain a motion at this time to do pass S.B. 391 (R1). \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  PETERS  MADE  A  MOTION  TO  DO  PASS \nSENATE BILL 391 (1ST REPRINT). \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN THOMAS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nAt this time, do we have any comments on the motion?   \n \nAssemblyman Hafen: \nAgain, I will be voting this out of Committee today, but reserve my right on the floor. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you.  Do we have any other comments on the motion?  [There were none.] \n \nTHE  MOTION  PASSED.    (ASSEMBLYMEN  BLACK,  KRASNER, \nMATTHEWS, AND TITUS VOTED NO.) \n \nI will assign that floor statement to Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson. \n \nNext, we will go to Senate Bill 379 (1st Reprint). \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 12, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nSenate Bill 379 (1st Reprint):  Provides for the collection of certain data concerning \nproviders of health care. (BDR 40-457) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \n[Patrick Ashton read a description of the bill from the work session document, Exhibit F.]  \nWe heard Senate Bill 379 (1st Reprint) on May 5, 2021.  It requires the director of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to establish and maintain a database of certain \ndemographic and practice information about health care providers.  The director must make \nan electronic data request available to health professional licensing boards to request certain \ndata from applicants for the renewal of a license or certification.  In addition, the director \nmust establish the Health Care Workforce Working Group to analyze information in the \ndatabase and make recommendations concerning how to attract health care providers to \nNevada.  Finally, certain data from the database must be published annually.  There were no \namendments. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any questions from members of the Committee?  Seeing none, at this time I would \nentertain a motion to do pass S.B. 379 (R1). \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  PETERS  MADE  A  MOTION  TO  DO  PASS \nSENATE BILL 379 (1ST REPRINT). \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  SUMMERS-ARMSTRONG  SECONDED  THE \nMOTION. \n \nDo we have any comments on the motion at this time? \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI am going to support this measure although at first, I was not.  With the testimony that it is \ndefinitely voluntary, and that it can be used to help with certain designations in health care \nshortage areas and anticipate future needs, I think it is important to do. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any other comments on the motion? \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI am really excited about this.  I am excited to see the data that gets collected as well.  Maybe \ndown the line, the boards might want to consider giving one CEU [continuing education unit] \nfor those who complete the questionnaire in order to encourage that.  I know we want to \nencourage a good response rate, so I think that would be fair.  I am just throwing this concept \nout there for future legislatures to deliberate. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 12, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI am not going to lie.  I enjoy the fact that I get to waive my CLE [continuing legal \neducation] requirements while the legislative body is in session.  Do we have any other \ncomments on the motion?  [There were none.] \n \nTHE MOTION PASSED.  (ASSEMBLYMEN BLACK AND MATTHEWS \nVOTED NO.) \n \nI will assign that floor statement to Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson. \n \nNext, we will go to our final bill on the work session, Senate Bill 305 (1st Reprint). \n \nSenate  Bill  305  (1st  Reprint):    Makes  various  changes  relating  to  access  to  organ \ntransplants for persons with disabilities. (BDR 40-40) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \n[Patrick Ashton read a description of the bill from the work session document, Exhibit G.]  \nWe heard Senate Bill 305 (1st Reprint) on May 3, 2021.  The bill makes various changes \nrelated to access to organ transplants for individuals with disabilities.  Specifically, it: \n \n•  Prohibits health care providers, medical facilities, facilities for the dependent, the \nDepartment  of  Corrections,  city  or  county  jails,  and  those  who  provide  medical \nservices  to  incarcerated  individuals  from  taking  certain  actions  related  to  organ \ntransplants solely on the basis of a person's disability; \n \n•  Limits the extent to which a person's disability may be considered when making \nrecommendations or decisions regarding an organ transplant; \n \n•  Authorizes  a  person  aggrieved  by  failure  to  comply  with  these  requirements  to \ninstitute a civil action for injunctive or other appropriate relief and requires a court to \ngive priority to such an action; and \n \n•  Prohibits all health insurers from denying, limiting, or seeking reimbursement from \nan insured for care related to an organ transplant because the insured is a person with \na disability, among other things. \n \nThere were no amendments. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 12, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any questions on S.B. 305 (R1)?  Seeing none, I would entertain a motion to do \npass S.B.  305 (R1). \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  PETERS  MADE  A  MOTION  TO  DO  PASS \nSENATE BILL 305 (1ST REPRINT). \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN TITUS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nDo we have any comments on the motion?  [There were none.] \n \nTHE MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \nI will assign that floor statement to Assemblyman Matthews. \n \nThat concludes our work session part of the agenda, and I will move to public comment.  \nAgain, as we begin public comment, a reminder to those providing public comment either in \nperson or on the phone, please clearly state your name for the record and spell it and limit \nyour comments to two minutes.  Is there anyone for public comment?  [There was no one.]  \nAt this time, I will close public comment.  Are there any other comments from Committee \nmembers before we adjourn today?  Seeing none, that concludes our meeting for today.  We \ndo not have any bills scheduled for this week.  We will have a possible work session on \nFriday for any remaining bills.  The meeting is adjourned [at 1:57 p.m.]. \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nTerry Horgan \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nAssemblywoman Rochelle T.

Committee rules and protocol were explained.]  Today, we have a work \nsession.  I am going to take the bills out of order, starting with Senate Bill 329 (1st Reprint).   \n \nSenate Bill 329 (1st Reprint):  Revises provisions relating to competition in health care \nmarkets. (BDR 40-998) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \nSenate Bill 329 (1st Reprint) was heard on May 5, 2021 [Exhibit C].  It requires hospitals and \ncertain physician group practices to notify the Department of Health and Human Services \n(DHHS) of any merger, acquisition, or similar transaction in which they are involved.  The \nDepartment must post the information contained in such notices on the Internet and publish \nan annual report based on the information.  Additionally, the bill prohibits health care \nproviders,  including  health  care  facilities,  from  entering  into,  offering  to  enter  into,  or \nsoliciting a contract that prohibits a third-party insurer from steering covered persons to \ncertain health care providers or placing health care providers in tiers; or places certain other \nrestrictions on the insurer.  Health care providers or insurers who violate these provisions are \nsubject to a civil penalty and are guilty of a category D felony.  Finally, the bill authorizes the \nattorney general to use certain fees to investigate prohibited contracting practices. \n \nSenator Roberta Lange proposes the following amendments, which can be found attached to \nthe work session document.   \n \n1.  Revise section 1 to additionally require a person who owns all or substantially all of a \nphysician  group  practice  to  report  to  DHHS  any  merger,  acquisition,  or  similar \ntransaction in which he or she is involved.   \n2.  Revise section 20.9 to prohibit a provider of health care, including a facility that \nprovides health care, from willfully entering into, willfully offering to enter into, or \nwillfully soliciting a contract that:   \n•  prohibits  a  third-party  insurer  from  steering  covered  persons  to  certain \nproviders of health care or placing providers of health care in tiers; or  \n•  places certain other restrictions on the third-party insurer.  \n3.  Revise sections 20.9 and 20.95 to make a provider of health care or third-party insurer \nwho commits certain violations subject to a misdemeanor instead of a felony. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 14, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any questions? \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nI want to extend my appreciation to the people working on this bill for getting through some \nof the concerns that came up during the hearing.  I would like to clarify one thing on the \nrecord.  My question is for legal counsel.  If a contract does not have prohibitive language \nthat directs who is the provider in a network, it would not fall under the provisions of  \nsection 20.9, is that correct?  \n \nKarly O'Krent, Committee Counsel: \nThat is correct.  Unless the contract expressly prohibits the third party from contracting with \nanother provider, the contract will not violate the provisions of this bill. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any other questions?  [There were none.]  I would entertain a motion to amend and \ndo pass Senate Bill 329 (1st Reprint). \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS MADE A MOTION TO AMEND AND DO \nPASS SENATE BILL 329 (1ST REPRINT). \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  BENITEZ-THOMPSON  SECONDED  THE \nMOTION. \n \nDo we have any comments on the motion?  [There were none.] \n \nTHE  MOTION  PASSED.    (ASSEMBLYMEN  BLACK,  HAFEN, \nKRASNER, MATTHEWS, AND TITUS VOTED NO.) \n \nI will take the floor statement.  We will begin the work session on Senate Bill 5 (1st Reprint). \n \nSenate Bill 5 (1st Reprint):  Makes changes relating to telehealth. (BDR 40-416) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \nSenate Bill 5 (1st Reprint) was heard on May 7, 2021 [Exhibit D].  It makes various changes \nto telehealth.  It clarifies that the definition of telehealth includes both synchronous and \nasynchronous interactions, and it adds audio-only interaction to the definition of telehealth, \nexcept as it relates to industrial insurance.  This change effectively revises existing law that \nrequires certain insurers and third-party payers to cover telehealth services to the same extent \nas if provided in person to also apply to services provided through audio-only interaction.  \nThe bill prohibits various third-party payers from refusing to pay for services provided \nthrough  telehealth  because  of  the  technology  used  and  categorizing  telehealth  services  \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 14, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \ndifferently  than  services  provided  in  person  for  purposes  related  to  coverage  or \nreimbursement.  In addition, S.B. 5 (R1) requires third-party payers to cover telehealth \nservices in the same amount as services provided in person or by other means—except for \nservices provided through audio-only interaction.   \n \nSenate  Bill  5  (1st  Reprint)  expressly  authorizes  health  care  providers  to  establish  a \nrelationship  with  patients  through  telehealth  and  authorizes  the  State  Board  of  Health \nto adopt regulations governing the establishment of a relationship in this manner.  Finally, \nthe bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services, to the extent money is \navailable,  to  establish  a  data  dashboard  that  allows  for  the  analysis  of  data  related  to \ntelehealth access.   \n \nLindsay  Knox,  Vice  President,  Government  Affairs  and  Advocacy,  McDonald  Carano, \nproposes to amend section 7 by removing from subsection 6, paragraph (d), of Nevada \nRevised  Statutes  616C.730,  the  use  of  asynchronous  system  of  storing  and  forwarding \ninformation as a form of telehealth delivery, thereby allowing only the use of synchronous \naudio-visual  communication  technology  for  telehealth  services  relating  to  industrial \ninsurance (workers' compensation).  Chair Rochelle Nguyen proposes to revise the payment \nparity requirements for telehealth services throughout the bill to expire one year after the date \non which the public health emergency relating to the COVID-19 pandemic expires but no \nlater  than June  30,  2023.    The  amendment  requires an exception  for  behavioral  health \nservices if the expiration date is before June 30, 2022.  In this case behavioral health services \nprovided through telehealth will continue to be reimbursed at the same rate as in-person \nservices until June 30, 2023. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any questions?  [There were none.]  I will entertain a motion to amend and do pass \nSenate Bill 5 (1st Reprint). \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS MADE A MOTION TO AMEND AND DO \nPASS SENATE BILL 5 (1ST REPRINT). \n \nASSEMBLYMAN HAFEN SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nAre there any comments on the motion? \n \nAssemblywoman Krasner: \nI appreciate the amendment; however, attorneys always get paid for their audio-only advice.  \nI cannot imagine our asking them not to get paid for that.  I feel this is bad policy, so I will be \nvoting no. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 14, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nAssemblywoman Ngyen: \nDo we have any other comments on the motion?  [There were none.]  \n \nTHE  MOTION  PASSED.    (ASSEMBLYMEN  BENITEZ-THOMPSON, \nBLACK, KRASNER, AND MATTHEWS VOTED NO.) \n \nI will assign the floor statement to Assemblywoman Peters.  We will move to our next bill. \n \nSenate  Bill  396  (1st  Reprint):    Revises  provisions  relating  to  the  purchasing  of \nprescription drugs. (BDR 38-443) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \nSenate Bill 396 (1st Reprint) was heard on April 26, 2021 [Exhibit E].  It authorizes public \nagencies in Nevada to enter into agreements with private entities within or outside of this \nstate for the purchase of prescription drugs, pharmaceutical services, or medical supplies and \nrelated services.  In addition, it authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services \n(DHHS) to enter into such an agreement for the purchase of prescription drugs for Medicaid \nor the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).  The bill also exempts from certain \ntransparency, rebate, and audit requirements certain Medicaid or CHIP contracts between \nDHHS and a pharmacy benefit manager or health maintenance organization entered pursuant \nto an agreement for the collaborative purchase of prescription drugs.   \n \nSenator Fabian Doñate proposes to revise section 2, subsection 2, paragraph (c), of Nevada \nRevised Statutes 422.4053 by removing provisions to exempt a contract between DHHS and \na pharmacy benefit manager or health maintenance organization entered into pursuant to an \nagreement for the collaborative purchasing of prescription drugs from certain requirements \nconcerning transparency, rebates and auditing.  The amendment makes conforming changes \nthroughout the bill.  The conceptual amendment is attached to the work session document. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any questions?   \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI would like to thank Senator Doñate.  He met with our legislative auditor, Daniel L. \nCrossman, and spent some time talking with him.  I am appreciative of any time we can keep \nour ability to trace and track our dollars in the state.  I think it is part of good government and \ntransparency.  This is a lot of money, and we want to be able to follow and audit it.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any questions?  [There were none.]  Do I have a motion? \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 14, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  BENITEZ-THOMPSON  MADE  A  MOTION  TO \nAMEND AND DO PASS SENATE BILL 396 (1ST REPRINT). \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nDo we have further comments on the motion?  [There were none.]  \n \nTHE MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \nI will assign the floor statement to Assemblywoman Thomas.  We will go to our last bill, \nSenate Bill 188 (1st Reprint). \n \nSenate Bill 188 (1st Reprint):  Establishes programs for certain persons of low-income \nand persons in foster care. (BDR 38-711) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \nSenate Bill 188 (1st Reprint) was heard on April 26, 2021 [Exhibit F].  It provides for the \nestablishment of the Individual Development Account Program by the Office of the State \nTreasurer  if  sufficient  money  is  obtained.    The  Program  allows  certain  persons  from  \nlow-income households to establish an individual development account (IDA) into which a \nperson deposits money to save and use later for certain purposes.  The State Treasurer may \nselect  one  or  more  fiduciary  organizations  to  administer  the  money  in  the  program.  \nTo establish an account, an eligible person and the fiduciary organization must enter into an \nagreement in which the account holder deposits funds into a financial institution and the \nfiduciary organization matches the funds with not more than $5 for each $1 deposited by the \naccount holder—up to $3,000 of matching funds in any 12-month period.  Money in an IDA \nmay be withdrawn for specific purposes, including postsecondary education, job training, \nrental or purchase of a primary residence, establishing a small business, and retirement \nsavings, among others.  If the Department of Health and Human Services, a foster care \nlicensing agency, or a housing authority receives funding from the State Treasurer, the entity \nmust ensure instruction in financial literacy is provided to IDA account holders.  These \naccounts may not be considered income when determining eligibility for Medicaid or for a \nhousing project.  \n \nSenate  Bill  188  (1st  Reprint)  also  creates  the  Nevada  Statewide  Council  on  Financial \nIndependence, which is responsible for:  \n \n1.  developing statewide priorities and strategies for helping individuals who receive \npublic assistance or social services to increase their financial independence;   \n2.  coordinating with state agencies; and  \n3.  overseeing the IDA Program.   \n \nFinally, the bill requires the State Treasurer to ensure that instruction and training in business \nopportunities are provided to tenants of housing authorities and certain nonprofits and to \nappoint and employ a deputy of financial literacy and security. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 14, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nSenator Pat Spearman proposes amendments found attached to the work session document.  \nThe amendments would: \n \n1.  Revise the bill to additionally authorize a relative or fictive kin of a child placed in his \nor her care by an agency which provides child welfare services to:  \n•  qualify to become an IDA holder;  \n•  establish an IDA for a child placed in his or her care; and  \n•  deposit certain money received by him or her into the account.  \n2.  Provide that money deposited in an IDA established by a relative or fictive kin of a \nchild placed in his or her care is the property of the child and may be:  \n•  accessed by the child upon reaching 18 years of age; and  \n•  used for certain purposes.  \n3.  Require an agency which provides child welfare services to ensure that instruction in \nfinancial literacy is provided to a child on whose behalf an IDA is established by a \nrelative or fictive kin, to the extent that money is provided by the State Treasurer.   \n4.  Replace individual definitions of “fictive kin” throughout Nevada Revised Statutes \nChapter 432B with a chapter-wide definition of that term that is identical to the \ndefinition of the term currently used in individual sections of that chapter.   \n5.  Authorize the State Treasurer in section 25, subsection 5, to adopt specific regulations \nrelating to the administration of IDAs by fiduciary organizations, including, without \nlimitation, regulations governing fees charged by fiduciary organizations. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThere are a few amendments.  I appreciate the members who reached out to make this bill \nbetter.  Are there any questions regarding the amendments?  Seeing none, I would entertain a \nmotion to amend and do pass Senate Bill 188 (1st Reprint). \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS MADE A MOTION TO AMEND AND DO \nPASS SENATE BILL 188 (1ST REPRINT). \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN TITUS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nDo we have any comments on the motion?   \n \nAssemblyman Matthews: \nWhile I believe the intent of this bill is good and even admirable, my belief is also this is \nsomething that does not belong within the purview of the state government.  I will be a no on \nthis today. \n \nAssemblywoman Black: \nI want to second my colleague's comments.  I feel this is a better job for a nonprofit \norganization or something of that nature. \n \nAssemblywoman Ngyen: \nAre there any other comments on the motion?  [There were none.]  \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 14, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nTHE MOTION PASSED.

With that, we are \ndone with our work session.   \n \nAt this time, I will begin taking public comment.  [There was none.]  I will close public \ncomment.  Are there any comments from members?  [There were none.]   \n \nThat concludes our meeting for right now.  I do not have a meeting scheduled for next \nMonday [May 17, 2021] but anticipate we will have things coming up next week; we will \nprobably have other meetings.  We will recess [at 1:47 p.m.].

Committee rules and protocol were explained.]  We will now move on to \nour first agenda item and open the bill hearing on Senate Bill 70 (2nd Reprint). \n \nSenate Bill 70 (2nd Reprint):  Revises provisions governing mental health. (BDR 39-\n418) \n \nJessica Flood, Coordinator, Northern Regional Behavioral Health Policy Board: \n[Jessica Flood presented a PowerPoint, Exhibit C.]  I included a few slides at the beginning \nthat talk about the background of the Northern Regional Behavioral Health Policy Board.  \nWe started this work in 2017 to prepare for the 2019 Session and successfully passed \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 24, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nAssembly Bill 85 of the 80th Session, modernizing and clarifying the mental health crisis \nhold process [page 2, Exhibit C].  In that process, we had a deeper understanding of Nevada \nRevised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 433A, and Senate Bill 70 (2nd Reprint) is a continuation of \nthat work.  Part of the product of A.B. 85 of the 80th Session was that we developed this \nbrochure [page 4] that we sent out to all the hospitals—10,000 copies in the last year.  I hope \nthat type of work will continue with S.B. 70 (R2) if it were to pass. \n \nI want to start with a brief overview of mental health crisis holds [page 5].  All 50 states in \nthe U.S. have involuntary mental health hold laws to protect people and communities from \nrisk of harm to self or others or inability to care for self due to mental illness.  It is the \ngreatest  loss  of  individual  rights  in  society  other  than  arrest  and  is  based  upon  the \nconstitutional ability of police intervention for harm to self or others.  Nevada's mental health \ncrisis hold lasts for 72 hours, which is common among the states.  It includes the process of \ndetention and application for emergency admission, medical evaluation, and certification that \nthe individual is indeed in a mental health crisis.  At any time after medical evaluation and \ncertification, that individual may be admitted into an inpatient psychiatric facility under \nemergency admission.  If the crisis lasts longer than 72 hours, the petitioner needs to petition \nthe court for an involuntary court-ordered admission into an inpatient psychiatric facility for \ntreatment for up to six months [page 6].  I want to also note that, since 2014, Nevada has also \nhad an involuntary outpatient treatment mechanism in the law as well that is known as \nassisted outpatient treatment and also lasts up to six months. \n \nThis is a quick overview of what I just discussed showing the steps of the mental health crisis \nhold [page 7].  These are the changes we made in S.B. 70 (R2) [page 8].  We tackled many \npieces of the mental health crisis hold process.  You will see that we updated the terms, \ndefinitions, and criteria for the mental health crisis hold process.  We updated the chemical \nrestraint definition and the family petition process.  We clarified and defined the emergency \nadmission,  updated  the  involuntary  court-ordered  admission  into  inpatient  psychiatric \nhospitals, updated conditional release, updated assisted outpatient treatment, and created \na clearer process.   \n \nI want to note that many of these concepts are not likeable, per se, but they are necessary.  \nSometimes we have legislators who have wanted to vote against these, but by voting against \nthis, you are voting against clarifying the law.  The effort of S.B. 70 (R2) is not to create any \nnew mechanisms, just to clarify and update those mechanisms so we have a more transparent \nprocess that patients, families, and providers can understand.  We are trying to get everyone \non the same page; so we really see this as upholding patient rights.   \n \nIn the process of developing S.B. 70 (R2), we had very diverse stakeholder involvement.  \nI  facilitated  a  statewide  mental  health  crisis  hold  work  group  at  the  request  of  the \nNorthern Regional Behavioral Health Policy Board since 2017.  We have had very strong \nparticipation from Clark County's Judge Yeager, Washoe County's Judge Lu, the public \ndefenders, the Division of Public and Behavioral Health within the Department of Health and \nHuman Services (DHHS), the Nevada Hospital Association, et cetera.  You can read the list \nyourselves [page 9].  On the youth side, we had a lot of participation from the Department of \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 24, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nEducation;  the  Clark  County  School  District; Clark  County,  Washoe  County,  and  rural \nchild welfare agencies; the Division of Child and Family Services, Department of Health and \nHuman  Services;  and  children  and  family  advocates  from  Nevada  PEP  Statewide \nFamily Network.         \n \nAt 70 pages, the bill is huge.  It is complex, but it can be broken down into five elements \n[page 10, Exhibit C].  It updates and modernizes the mental health crisis hold law, and it \nupdates assisted outpatient treatment and conditional release.  We did not recreate the youth \nmental health crisis hold process that was created in the 2019 Session; we adjusted some \npieces so it is workable and aligned with parental rights.  We updated the chemical restraint \ndefinition as well, and I will walk you through each one of these processes.  \n \nThe first element involves updating the mental health crisis hold process and defining terms \n[page 11].  As I said, A.B. 85 of the 80th Session made a few changes, but as we got into \nNRS Chapter 433A, we realized that it was written in 1975.  Because there have not been any \nchanges since then, it reads as though it is from 1975.  Right now, it reads that a law \nenforcement  officer  detains  an  individual  and  applies  for  emergency  admission  into  an \ninpatient  psychiatric  facility.    It  is  a  one-step  process  where  they  detain  and  take  the \nindividual into an inpatient psychiatric facility for evaluation.  That is not our current system.  \nOur current system is now detainment and you are brought to either a mental health crisis \ncenter or to a hospital emergency room (ER) where you are evaluated and observed.  A large \npercentage of people are taken off that hold because they are found to be stable or to not meet \nthe criteria.  That step was missing in our statute, and we tried to break apart that first mental \nhealth crisis hold and the emergency admission to modernize the law. \n \nOur proposed solutions are in sections 28 to 32, updating the mental health crisis hold \nprocess to align with current practice and clearly separating the mental health crisis hold \nfrom emergency admission.  In sections 3 through 8, we developed definitions for the terms \nthat were used in the law so everyone can be on the same page.  In section 26, because we \nadjusted the \"application for emergency admission,\" we are now using a more neutral term—\n\"mental health crisis hold.\"  Before, the Attorney General would approve forms for the \nadmission of people to inpatient psych; and now, they will approve the forms for detainment, \nevaluation, treatment, and conditional release, so that expands the added terms we developed. \n \nWe clarified the family petition for court-ordered pickup [page 12].  The problem was that \nthe process in law was unworkable and vague, so we updated it.  Section 9 develops the \npetition process for court-ordered pickup and evaluation of individuals suspected to meet \ncriteria for mental health crisis.  Section 36 removes the ability for a spouse, parent, adult \nchildren,  or  legal  guardian to  petition  for straight  admission  to  an inpatient  psychiatric \nfacility.  Because we are always trying to think, it is nice to have screens and filters for \npeople to go into inpatient psychiatric facilities.  With the current process, it makes sense for \nthem to go to a hospital ER.  If they are deemed appropriate, and based on their insurance, \nthey can go into an inpatient psychiatric facility.  This one-step process straight into the \ninpatient psychiatric facility is reminiscent of the 1970s and no longer necessary.   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 24, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nWe clarified the hospital and court procedure for individuals who cannot be medically \ncleared in 72 hours [page 13, Exhibit C].  That process was really unworkable in the law, and \nwe made it so that it is clear.  Hospitals did not have a place to turn to in the law to \nunderstand what process to take when those individuals are not medically cleared within that \ntime, so we corrected that.  We also updated hospital times for notifying guardians and courts \n[page 14].  Currently in law, hospitals are required to provide a notice of discharge to courts \nand guardians for patients who are under involuntary court-ordered admission ten days prior \nto discharge.  That is actually a longer length of stay than the average length of stay for \npeople in inpatient psychiatric units, which is now about seven days.  We brought those times \ndown to three days prior to discharge.  We also allow for flexibility for hospitals because \nthere are people who only stay for one day sometimes.  We tried to create more reasonable \nguidelines for that notification, because it is an essential part of the discharge process.  \nSections 39, 47, 48, and 48.5 made those changes.      \n \nWe clarified the involuntary court-ordered and county transfer process [page 15].  Patients \nwere getting lost in the system if they were transferred between counties, and there was no \nstandard timeline that existed to ensure detention does not extend beyond the legal limits.  \nSection 39 requires a person who submits such a petition to notify a court if the subject of the \npetition is currently admitted to a mental health facility or hospital and has been transferred \nto another facility.  That helps courts who have ordered people in to keep track of where \nthese people go.  Section 41.5 clarifies the court transfer process when examining personnel \nare not available and the county of residence is responsible.  Again, there are times when, \nsay, Esmeralda County does not have the resources to be able to do this court-ordered \nadmission.  By law, they are able to transfer that to another county and it was vague in the \nlaw.  We have been able to clarify it so the courts can be on the same page with that.  Then \nthere is direct filing in the county of treatment which allows a mechanism for the petitioner, \nfor instance a rural hospital—knowing that the person is going to West Hills Behavioral \nHealth Hospital in Washoe County—can petition Washoe County to do the court-ordered \nadmission.  That way, Washoe County can have oversight of that patient while that person is \nin the Washoe County system.  That creates a more streamlined process and also conforms to \ncurrent practice.   \n \nContinuing this update of the involuntary court-ordered and county transfer process, one \nproblem was that courts throughout the state order patients into state services without the \nnecessary evaluation and acceptance process [page 16].  This happens a lot with Northern \nNevada Adult Mental Health Services and Southern Nevada Adult Mental Health Services.  \nThere needed to be an actual acceptance process from the hospital following admission \nguidelines, so we clarified that once a person is involuntarily admitted to a mental health \nfacility, the admitting court can transfer the case, and the mental health facility is required to \nnotify the court if the person is transferred.  Actually, that is already in law.  Once you do one \ncourt-ordered admission, that is it.  You have that court-ordered admission.  Currently what \nis happening is some rural courts will do the court-ordered admission and then try to transfer \nthe case to the urban areas.  You can see it is messy because there is not much clarity in the \nlaw.  Section 50 of this bill prohibits the transfer of a consumer who has been admitted to \na mental health facility or required to receive assisted outpatient treatment to another facility \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 24, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nor provider of treatment unless arrangements are made regarding the cost of treatment.  \nAgain, we need to be on the same page when there are transfers and work according to the \nsystem we have regarding insurance and such. \n \nSection 48 abolishes the requirement that an evaluation team evaluate a person who is under \na court-ordered admission in a mental health facility or required to receive assisted outpatient \ntreatment before the person can be unconditionally released before the expiration of the order \n[page 17, Exhibit C].  Right now that does not happen, and all the stakeholders thought that \nwas an unnecessary step.  Section 23.5 updates the term \"person professionally qualified in \nthe field of psychiatric mental health\" so the term is used for both public and private.  This \nallows us to have a shorthand term for that type of person as opposed to continuing to list all \nthe people who would be able to fit under that term.  In section 3.5, we applied the term \n\"consumer\" to the entirety of NRS Chapter 433A so we can be on the same page with \ndefinitions.  Then we closed a loophole.  Prior to S.B. 70 (R2), what is in current law \nmandates courts to seal records in cases of court-ordered admission but not for all these other \npeople who are in the system and still going to court.  Therefore, there would be a person \nwho could go to court, have their case heard, the court would deny it, and there was no \nmandate that the court would seal that record.  There were other cases like that, so we wanted \nto make sure there was standardized privacy across the board. \n \nFor  assisted  outpatient  treatment  (AOT),  the  court-ordered  outpatient  treatment,  these \nprograms were written into law in 2014 and they were specific programs funded by the \nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration within the U.S. Department of \nHealth and Human Services, the federal funding arm for mental health [page 18].  They were \nunique programs with one in Clark County and one in Washoe County.  We had a technical \nassistance provider come and tell us that it is actually a generic mechanism of treatment \nacross the board and that these are not specialized programs.  We worked to develop a law \nthat allows for that generic use in all counties and not just in Washoe and Clark Counties.  \nWe also had an interesting part of Nevada law.  It was the only state that first required that \nthe patient meet criteria for inpatient hospitalization and then meet AOT criteria.  Basically, \nthe courts needed to find that someone was a danger to self or others before ordering them \ninto outpatient treatment in the community.  We made some improvements in this with the \ncriteria so people are able to see the specific criteria in the population that this court-ordered \ntreatment would fit.  The proposed solutions are in sections 11 through 21, 20.5, 24, and 43, \nwhich develop specific assisted outpatient treatment criteria and program procedures and \nclarify and update current law for implementation in all counties.  It creates a separate AOT \nprocess so that the AOT process is interwoven into the inpatient process and now it is very \neasy to read and understand.  You will see that there is this requirement that the same counsel \nmust continue to represent the person, so section 42 moves that piece into the AOT section so \nit is all one cohesive format. \n \nAs I was saying, we created a generic term, and we think this creates a clear and transparent \nprocess so individuals will know what AOT is and how to petition for the program [page 19].  \nIt enables community providers to provide AOT services in coordination with courts.  In my \nregion we have certified community behavioral health clinics (CCBHCs).  Those agencies \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 24, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nare able to provide the services of AOT, so it is possible for us to expand assisted outpatient \ntreatment, at least in my region, into other regions that have CCBHCs without needing state \nfunding.   As I was saying, it clearly identifies the target population instead of just saying the \nperson is a danger to self or others; for instance, if the person is over the age of 18, has \na mental illness, and has a history of poor compliance.  There are even basic outcomes the \nperson needs to meet; for example, been hospitalized, receiving services in a behavioral \nhealth unit, in a detention facility for 48 months, et cetera.  The last one is that the person \nmust be capable of surviving in the community in which he or she resides without substantial \nlikelihood of serious harm to himself or herself or others if he or she receives AOT. \n \nConditional release is another mechanism that provides a level of care in the community that \nwe are working toward [page 20, Exhibit C].  These are individuals in inpatient psychiatric \nunits.  I used to work in one as a discharge planner.  You get them stabilized so they are no \nlonger a danger to self or others and they are under a court-ordered admission, but you know \nthat without necessary supports, they are going to deteriorate when they leave.  In those \nsituations,  it  is  hard  to  discharge  because  it  is  essentially  an  unsafe  discharge.    Many \nhospitals may decide to keep that person until the end of the court-ordered admission and  if \nthey still have not found a great solution, the person is discharged without good support and \ndeteriorates—as we suspected would happen.   \n \nWhat this mechanism creates is a discharge plan on steroids where the hospital, if the \nindividual is still under inpatient court-ordered involuntary admission, can try the individual \nout by coordinating with a team in the community and having the individual agree to certain \nterms.  They may tell the person, you are going to go to treatment, a community team is \ngoing to check in with you, and we are really going to try to create a warm handoff into the \ncommunity.    The  hospital  can  provide  that  information  to  the  court,  and  this  is  really \nimportant in a place like Clark County because they have 20 hospitals.  You have people \nconstantly going all through those hospitals and they are re-creating the wheel with every \ndischarge plan, every treatment plan.  The court can serve as a central entity and be able to \ncoordinate that care so if that individual comes back in, the court can say, \"This is what the \nlast treatment team said worked; here are the medications,\" and be able to provide that to the \nnext hospital for continuity of care.  If the individual looks as though they are starting to \ndeteriorate, the community organization working with the individual can come to the court \nand at least inform them of the deterioration that is happening.  We are really trying to create \nanother supported level of care in the communities.  Sections 22, 39, and 47 clarify and \nupdate the conditional release process.  This was already in the law.  It was completely \nunworkable.  We think that having more court oversight will provide more due process for \nindividuals. \n \nLooking at the youth mental health crisis hold, as I was saying, they were using inaccurate \nterms when the law was written [page 21].  The way the law was written also was saying that \nhospitals have to notify the parents of the youth being detained on a hold 24 hours after that \nemergency admission.  It is hoped that the youth would never be admitted to an inpatient \npsychiatric  facility  without  parental  consent  or  knowledge  or  without  some  other  due \nprocess.  We thought what it is really trying to say is that hospitals have to notify the parents \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 24, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nwithin 24 hours of the placement of the hold, so we made small changes like that.  Section 33 \nclarifies and changes the time hospitals detaining a youth must notify a parent or legal \nguardian of holding a youth under a mental health crisis hold from 24 hours to 8 hours.  That \nwas a big request from the family advocates, and we thought that was reasonable from the \nhospital's perspective.  As a hospital, that is the first thing you should be doing if a youth is \ncoming in without a parent.  Section 35 also creates a mechanism for youth to be released \nfrom  a  mental  health  crisis  hold  to  parent  custody  if  the  guardian  or  parent  agrees  to \ntreatment or accepts physical custody of the youth.  Right now, there is no place on the form \nfor that, so we wanted to create that option and mechanism. \n \nThis next slide [page 22, Exhibit C] is titled \"chemical restraint,\" and everyone is probably \nconcerned about it.  Nevada's chemical restraint mechanism was developed in 1975, is \noutdated, and does not take into account innovations, new medications, and new uses of \nmedications in health care approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The \nsolution was in sections 2, 65, 66, and 68, where the term \"chemical restraint\" is used, and \nexcludes modern FDA-approved interventions for treatment from the definition of \"chemical \nrestraint.\"  This was proposed by the Division of Public and Behavioral Health, DHHS, \nwhose staff worked closely with the chair of the Commission on Behavioral Health, also \nwithin DHHS.  That was the last slide, and I am happy to accept questions. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAssemblywoman Titus, who sits on the Northern Regional Behavioral Health Policy Board, \nalso has a presentation in support of S.B. 70 (R2). \n \nAssemblywoman Robin L. Titus, Assembly District No. 38: \nI have been seated on this board now for two sessions, and I know Ms. Flood gave you an \noverview of what the board does.  There are now five boards that all have representatives \nfrom the Legislature sitting on them.  Those of you on this Committee know we have been \nworking for many sessions on what we know as the original \"Legal 2000\" hold, trying to fix \nthis statute.  The ultimate goal was to make sure that a person's rights were upheld, that the \nperson got medical and mental attention in an expeditious manner and was able to get \ntreatment.   During these many sessions we tried to identify where the hiccups were on this, \nand over the years we heard testimony concerning people being stuck in emergency rooms \nbecause they needed a medical clearance or medication or a place where they could be sent.   \n \nI want to give credit to Ms. Flood.  What she did was engage every single aspect of this large \nbill and not just from the medical aspect, which is what we would get hung up on, but also \nthe judicial aspect—whether it was in the rurals or in the urban areas, whether it was a little \nhospital or a big hospital.  The key was trying to look at what the needs were throughout the \nstate and making sure patients in mental health crises were treated both from a medical \naspect and, at the same time, making sure their legal rights were upheld.  Again, thank you \nfor hearing this bill. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 24, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you, Assemblywoman Titus, and thank you, Ms. Flood.  I know in talking with many \nof the stakeholders that you spoke with that you often met weekly, if not twice a week, \nthroughout the entire pandemic to make sure you were incorporating all the stakeholders.  \nDo we have any questions from Committee members? \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nThank you to Assemblywoman Titus and Ms. Flood.  Are hospitals equipped to handle the \nmentally ill or people who they suspect are mentally ill?  I know in the south there are several \nprivate mental health facilities that can assist because that is what they do.  However, the \nhospitals do not seem to be zeroing in on just that subject. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI would say that the hospitals absolutely were not, which is what was critical to another piece \nof legislation.  We passed a bill involving crisis stabilization centers which were critical to \nlooking at the overall mental health of our state.  One thing we identified is that we do not \nhave adequate mental health care throughout our state.  The little hospital where I practiced is \nan eight-bed hospital.  We did not have a mental health area where we could stabilize \npatients  who  were  in  mental  health  crises.    That  was  a  component  we  are  addressing \nthroughout the state, and we are getting better at it, but this bill addresses that.  This bill says \nwhat do I do in the ER in my rural area, how long were patients sitting in a big urban \nemergency room with no access to adequate mental health within that ER because neither my \nlittle hospital nor that ER were mental health centers.  So, partly, we are trying to address that \nwith this legislation and other bills we have seen here. \n \nJessica Flood: \nAs Assemblywoman Titus said, we are trying to develop that alternate behavioral health \ncrisis response system.  That 988 legislation [National Suicide Prevention Lifeline], the crisis \nstabilization unit—it is pretty amazing watching that be built.  We have acknowledged that \nhospitals  largely  cannot  respond  to  mental  illness,  so  creating  those  crisis  stabilization \ncenters and the crisis call line are essential to being able to adequately respond to people who \nare in mental health crises. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nIf I am understanding this, once that person is admitted to the ER and they know this person \nis basically unstable, are they transferred to another facility that actually can get them the \nhelp they really need without a court order? \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nWhen we start a mental health hold, there has to be a medical screening before they get \nadmitted to the medical facility.  That is where our ER would come in.  The person would be \nbrought to me, I would evaluate them and make sure their mental health crisis is not due to \na medical reason like low blood sugar, stopping their medications, or some other medical \nreason.  Once we have cleared them medically, we cannot release them until we have an \naccepting facility.  That warm handoff, as Ms. Flood mentioned, is a critical component, as is \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 24, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nhaving access to a bed.  For example, there have been times when they would stay in our ER \nfor days until we could get them into a facility.   \n \nJessica Flood: \nI would like to add that a court order is not always necessary.  Sometimes people can be on a \nhold, and if they voluntarily want to go into a facility, that hold can be discontinued; or if the \ncrisis ends, the hold can be discontinued.  People are going to hospital ERs, but the goal is \nfor them to go to holds in these crisis stabilization units.  In my region, we have the Mallory \nBehavioral Health Crisis Center that works as a psychiatric ER. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nWhen you mentioned a conditional release, I was trying to understand how the courts are in \nthe role of assessing whether the person is deemed to be released.  A doctor can determine \nwhether this person is able to be released yet the courts have to give permission.  Is that what \nyou meant during your presentation? \n \nJessica Flood: \nThe courts do not give approval for a discharge; the hospitals decide the discharge.  The \ncourts are only notified that the conditional release has occurred.  The courts get the form \nthat the hospitals have done with the community provider so they can be a central repository \nof coordination, but there is no approval from the courts. \n \nAssemblywoman Krasner: \nThank you for the presentation.  I appreciate the intent of the bill, but I have questions.  The \nfirst one is about an involuntary health crisis hold.  The word \"involuntary\" scares me.  Here \nin the United States we value our individual rights and liberties, our freedom of movement \nunder the Constitution, so \"involuntary hold\" should give all of us pause.  I understand there \nare people who really are going through mental health crises who do need this, but as \nlegislators, we have to be thoughtful and think about odd cases—a worst-case scenario.  \nWhat if somebody is taken against their will in this involuntary mental health crisis hold for \n72 hours and really does not belong there?  My first question is, at every point along the way \nduring the 72-hour extended hold—if somebody decides they are going to go for an extended \nhold—does that individual have the right to petition the court for release or at least a hearing? \n \nJessica Flood: \nYes, they do.  In NRS Chapter 433A we have habeas corpus where the individual can \npetition the court at any time.  Actually, that was why we started this work in the first place.  \nThe law is not well understood, so patients were not able to understand what their rights \nwere.  Prior to A.B. 85 of the 80th Session, the hold started at a very ambiguous time after \nmedical clearance.  You could be held against your will for, let us say 8 hours, and you \nwould ask, When does my 72 hours end?  They would say that it had not even started until \nafter medical clearance.  That was pre-2019, and we clarified all that so we could create \neducation.  That pamphlet I showed you [page 4, Exhibit C] talks about your right to go to \nthe court at any time and have a hearing on that.  There is also the Nevada Disability \nAdvocacy and Law Center that is able to advocate for individuals with mental illness in those \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 24, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nsituations as well as the American Civil Liberties Union.  Those are definitely why those \npieces are in place, and there is due process for anyone who requests it. \n \nAssemblywoman Krasner: \nThank you.  Is the adult or child given notice that they are entitled to a phone call within \nthree hours?  In NRS 171.153, a person who is arrested—again, their liberty is taken away, \ntheir freedom of movement—the law states that they must be allowed to make a phone call, \nor more than one reasonable phone call—a local phone call—within three hours.  In your bill \nI do not see that, and I think that should be added.  I wonder what your thoughts are about \nallowing somebody to be notified that they can make a phone call, whether it is an adult or \na minor, within three hours of the time they are taken against their will.  Do you have \nthoughts on that, please? \n \nJessica Flood: \nIn NRS Chapter 433A, the patient does have the right to access the telephone—not even just \nwithin three hours, but during their entire stay at a hospital.  When we created that brochure, \nit has all these rights listed.  I would be open to your thoughts if we need to add the three \nhours, but having blanket access to a telephone through the entire stay is really important. \n \nAssemblywoman Krasner: \nAlso in your presentation, did you state that your recent addition is that a minor, a person \nunder age 18 who is taken involuntarily, it is no longer going to be within 24 hours that the \nparent or guardian must be notified, it is going to be within 8 hours?  Did you state that? \n \nJessica Flood: \nYes. \n \nAssemblywoman Krasner: \nThat is a good start, but as a mom, if I did not know where my child was for eight hours, \nI would be in a huge panic.  I feel it is so important, for a minor especially, that they are \nallowed  within  three  hours  to  make  phone  calls  to  a  parent,  a  guardian,  a  friend, \na grandparent—somebody.  In NRS 171.153, if we are allowing someone who has been \narrested to have that right, we certainly should allow a child to contact a parent, a guardian, \na trusted friend, a grandparent—somebody.  I feel strongly that should be included in this.  \nI appreciate all your hard work, and I know I am bringing up nuances, but as a parent I feel it \nis so important that we have that language in here.  What are your thoughts on that? \n \nJessica Flood: \nI think your request is reasonable.  As a hospital, it should be happening as soon as a child \ncomes in.  If law enforcement brings a child in, you would think the first thing the hospital \nwould want to do is try to get ahold of that parent. \n \nWith this diverse stakeholder group, there is a lot of push and pull and tension.  There are \nthe hospitals saying that there are situations in which they will not be able to do that.  Then \nyou have the parent and family advocates who say that it should be as you said, within \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 24, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nthree hours.  I think that is reasonable, but I do not know what the stakeholders think about \nthat; however, I would be open to seeing what the stakeholders think about it. \n \nAssemblywoman Krasner: \nThat is a vague response. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAssemblywoman Krasner, I will ask you to follow up with Jessica Flood.  I know she is \nspeaking on behalf of her position as coordinator for the Northern Regional Behavioral \nHealth Policy Board, so she probably has a difficult time answering that on behalf of all the \nstakeholders she has been speaking with. \n \nAssemblywoman Krasner: \nI appreciate that.  I just remember, when this bill came in, reading that a minor could \nbe taken without the consent of the parents or guardian and held for basically 23 hours and \n59 minutes without notifying the parents.  One of the directors of a local youth mental \nhospital reached out to me and said they were mortified by the bill.  They thought it would \nfurther traumatize children if they were not allowed to have that kind of contact or make \na phone call to a parent or guardian, so for the record, I wanted to see if we could put that in \nthere.  Since we give that right to people who are arrested, I thought we could also give that \nsame right to people who are taken against their will. \n \nJessica Flood: \nChair Nguyen, I appreciate your comment.  This has been a group effort with probably \n30 stakeholders.  I have my own opinions, but in terms of the agreement and the process we \nhave put in, I do not want to just agree to something because I am present in this hearing and \nthey are not.  On the other hand, I think it is very reasonable to think about three hours. \n \nAssemblywoman Krasner: \nThank you. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI know a lot of work went into this during the 2019 Session, and a lot of the work in \nS.B. 70 (R2) plays off the corrections and clarifying language that were needed to further \nimplement some of those protections for patients within the legal system, as well as within \ntheir medical care.  You mentioned telephone access.  The way I read it is they have access to \nthe telephone to make those kinds of calls and make those requests for a hearing at any \ntime—whether in the first five minutes of them coming into contact with the system or if it is \nthree or four hours later.  Is that correct? \n \nJessica Flood: \nThat is correct.   \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 24, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any other questions from Committee members at this time?  Seeing none, I will \nopen up testimony in support of S.B. 70 (R2). \n \nKatie  Roe  Ryan,  System  Director,  Nevada  Government  Relations,  Dignity  Health-\nSt. Rose Dominican: \nI have provided the Committee with a letter [Exhibit D] on the record in support and wanted \nto let everyone know that we have been a grateful partner in this process and are very \ngrateful to Ms. Flood for all the work she put into this. \n \nKendra  G.  Bertschy,  Deputy  Public  Defender,  Washoe  County  Public  Defender's \nOffice: \nI also want to thank all the stakeholders for meeting with our office to try to address the due \nprocess concerns we had and, more importantly, for continuing to work on this extremely \nimportant area of law.  By way of context, my office represents those individuals, those \nadults, who are involved in the involuntary commitment hearings.  In 2020, we had 2,185 \nindividuals who went through that process.  We appreciate the work that was done in the last \nsession and that has continued on here, to work on reworking our antiquated statutes and \nattempts to clear up the ongoing, systematic issues and provide clarity for parents, patients, \nand hospitals about the requirements.   \n \nTo address Assemblywoman Krasner's question, I am happy, Ms. Flood, to work with you to \nsee if there is anything else that needs to be done to ensure that everyone understands that \nthey do have rights to reach out to their parents or loved ones so that everyone knows where \nthey are located.   \n \nJoan Hall, President, Nevada Rural Hospital Partners: \nWe are here in support of S.B. 70 (R2).  This is an important clarification in our statute in \nkeeping the law aligned with current clinical practices and clear verbiage that will assist \npatients, family members, providers, first responders, as well as the judicial system, when \ncaring for patients who are in crisis.  This bill has had tremendous time and expertise \nexpended to ensure that it is a well-vetted product, and I would like to thank all those who \nwere involved in this process, and would appreciate your passage of this bill.  Thank you. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIs there further testimony in support?  [There was none.]   \n \n[Exhibit E and Exhibit F, letters in support, were submitted but not discussed and will \nbecome part of the record.] \n \nAt this time, I will start testimony in opposition to S.B. 70 (R2).  [There was none.]  I will \nstart testimony in neutral on S.B. 70 (R2).  [There was none.]  With that, I will turn this back \nover to Assemblywoman Titus and Jessica Flood for any closing remarks. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 24, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI appreciate the Committee hearing this bill.  This has been a decade-plus in the making, \ntrying to refine what was accomplished last session with A.B. 85 of the 80th Session.  \nNothing is ever perfect, which is why we come back all the time, but I think this has been \na collaborative effort with many stakeholders throughout this process, and I would appreciate \nyour support for this bill. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWith that, I will close the hearing on S.B. 70 (R2) and open the hearing on Senate Bill 158 \n(1st Reprint). \n \nSenate Bill 158 (1st Reprint):  Revises requirements to receive assistance from the \nKinship Guardianship Assistance Program. (BDR 38-504) \n \nGillian Block, representing Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers: \nThank you, Chair Nguyen, and members of the Committee.  Amy Honodel, representing the \nLegal  Aid  Center  of  Southern  Nevada,  is  on  Zoom  with  us  and  will  be  available  for \nquestions.  Senate Bill 158 (1st Reprint) is based on recommendations that came out of the \ninterim Legislative Committee on Child Welfare and Juvenile Justice.  I would like to thank \nSenator Ohrenschall for bringing this legislation forward. \n \nSenate Bill 158 (1st Reprint) amends Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 432B.623, which \nconcerns the Kinship Guardianship Assistance Program, or KinGAP.  The KinGAP program \nprovides financial assistance to a relative who becomes a legal guardian of a child in foster \ncare.  Currently, a child's relatives are only eligible to receive financial assistance through the \nprogram if adoption and reunification have been ruled out as permanency options.  Basically, \nthat means that even if it is not determined to be in the best interests of the child, as long as \nreunification or adoption are technically out there as options, that relative caregiver would \nnot be eligible for funding. \n \nSenate Bill 158 (1st Reprint) will revise this requirement so that instead of requiring ruling \nout adoption and reunification, a child welfare agency can determine that being returned \nhome or adopted are not appropriate permanency options for the child.  This is a small \nchange to the law that would ensure that the state law is not more restrictive than federal \nrequirements, which would expand opportunities to utilize federal dollars and ensure more \npermanency for kids.  The language matches the federal Title IV-E eligibility language so \nwe are not being overly restrictive about who can access federal dollars because there is \na technical legal difference between \"not possible\" versus \"not appropriate.\"   \n \nMaintaining family, community, and cultural ties is important for children, and adoption \nmay  not always be the best option.  A child might have a strong relationship with their \nrelative guardian.  Parents may not wish to terminate their parental rights.  The parents and \nthe guardian may have a good relationship too, and placement with relatives may allow \na parent and child to remain in contact.  Subsidized kinship guardianship is a way to offer \nfamilies another choice to help get children into supportive, more permanent, placements.  \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 24, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nSenate Bill 158 (1st Reprint) expands opportunities for federal funding, gives families more \noptions, and provides more permanency for children. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI see we have a couple of questions from Committee members. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank you for bringing this bill forward; I think it is important.  I have a question specific to \nthe bill.  In section 1, subsection 1, paragraph (c), it reads that \". . . services must determine \nthat being returned home or adopted are not appropriate permanency options for the child.\"  \nDoes that eliminate a family member from adopting the child?   \n \nGillian Block: \nI will let Amy Honodel elaborate on this, but no, this should just make it so that the more \nrestrictive language in the NRS is not controlling here and it will match the federal language. \n \nAmy Honodel, Staff Attorney, Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada: \nI represent youth in foster care.  No, it does not eliminate adoption as an option for these \nfamilies.  The way the amendment is written, adoption will still be on the table, and actually, \nit is best practices for us and the courts to do what is called \"concurrent\" planning so that two \nplans may be developed with the idea that we do not have to wait for one to be eliminated to \nget a youth out of the system.  There are times when adoption may not be what the child \ndesires; for example, if he or she is an older youth.  No, adoption would still be on the table.  \nIt would also be used in a case where a parent may not want to relinquish their rights and the \nevidence is not concrete to terminate their parental rights. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank you for that clarification.  I wanted to make sure it was on the record that the intent \nwas not to totally eliminate adoption as an option for the child or the children. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any other questions from Committee members? \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nThank you, Ms. Block, for bringing this bill forward.  I have a vested interest in it as I visited \nthe facility in North Las Vegas.  I had a relative who had to take in her three grandchildren \nbecause their mother had died.  She did not receive any help from the state in order to take \ncare of those children.  If I had taken the children, I could have received foster care money.  \nI am hoping this bill will eliminate that because this was a grandparent—or an aunt or other \nrelative—and that a relative can receive money from the state.  Is that what is happening with \nthis bill? \n \nAmy Honodel: \nAll relatives are eligible for financial assistance when they take children in.  They are able to \nbecome licensed foster parents and there is a shortened class requirement.  It is called kinship \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 24, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nlicensing, but this bill does not affect that.  What we are hoping to do going forward in other \nareas is help with the Clark County Department of Family Services and the Division of Child \nand Family Services within the Department of Health and Human Services.  Washoe County \nis also working on this to make sure relatives are given information very early on because it \nis a significant financial undertaking when they take on relatives' kids, but this bill will not \naffect that.  This bill in fact requires those relatives to become licensed before the case gets \nreferred for kinship guardianship.  The bill is so that the initial investigators are telling these \nrelatives that they can become licensed as foster parents as well as identifying what other \nsocial service help there will be. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nI  am  not  fully  understanding  that  because  it  seems  as  though  there  may  be  a \nmisunderstanding on my part that a grandparent, because they either have to adopt that child \nor reunify with the parent, would receive assistance. \n \nAmy Honodel: \nI am not sure where the confusion is coming from.  Right now, the way title IV-E funding \nand  the  foster  licensing  programs  are  written  and  prepared,  any  person—relative  or \nnonrelative—can become a licensed foster parent to take care of a kid.  Ideally, at the \nbeginning of a case when children are removed from their home, they do better with family.  \nThe law requires a preference for family placement.  The social worker or case manager who \nis doing the placement should be advising these people, whether it is a grandparent or another \nrelative, of the availability of licensing for them to provide a financial subsidy to them.  The \nbill  that  is  before  this  Committee  does  not  affect  that.    However,  it  does  contain  the \nrequirement that anyone who does this gets licensed and the kids are in the home with that \nperson  for  six  months  prior  to  the  time  the  guardianship  is  granted,  so  it  forces  the \nconversation.  In the case you were referring to, that grandparent would have been eligible \nfrom the beginning, but it is not affected by this bill. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nThank you.  If I understand what you are saying, that grandparent or relative would need to \nbe a licensed foster care person in order to receive assistance from the state. \n \nAmy Honodel: \nThat is correct and that is regardless of what the plan is for the child.  If the child will be \ngoing home or can be adopted, that does not affect that relative's eligibility to become \nlicensed.  We want these people to be supported when they have this unexpected request to \ntake care of children who are in their family. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nI have one more point of clarification.  I see that in order to become a licensed foster care \nperson, there is a referral to NRS 424.030.  What is the timeline on this?  A lot of these \nthings happen so quickly.  It could be death; it could be anything.  How much time?  As an \nexample, when I leave here, I work full-time.  Where do I find the time to become a licensed \nfoster care person?  If I am getting my licensing under NRS 424.030, are there online \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 24, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nclasses?  Do I have to go someplace?  If I do not do it fast enough, are you going to take my \ngrandbaby from me?  How does this work, because this is really scary. \n \nBailey Bortolin, Statewide Advocacy, Outreach and Policy Director, Nevada Coalition \nof Legal Service Providers: \nYes, it is a scary process for everyone involved.  KinGAP is a federal assistance program to \nfinancially assist families who are relatives who take in their children for the foster care \nsystem.  I believe the agency works with you and works around that timeline because we \nhave a preference for working with family members and the law to ensure that we are putting \nchildren with their relatives whenever possible.   \n \nWhat  this  bill  is  fixing,  to  put  a  finer  point  on  the  question  you  were  asking, \nAssemblywoman Thomas, is, everyone in the state of Nevada could agree that, in a child \nwelfare case, the most appropriate placement is to have this permanency plan of guardianship \nwith a relative.  That is why we have this federal KinGAP program; a lot of families cannot \nafford to just pull back and have no financial assistance and have the case closed under a \nguardianship with grandma.  She needs that financial assistance.  The federal KinGAP \nprogram that exists closes that loophole by providing that funding, but the way we currently \nhave interpreted that eligibility standard in the NRS is more restrictive than the Title IV-E \nfederal funding actually requires us to be.  By saying \"not possible,\" we have cases where it \nbecomes a debate in the legal system as to what \"not possible\" means.  Everyone could be on \nthe same page:  the social services agency, the child's social worker, the family members, the \nchild wants this.  Everyone wants the permanency plan to close this case and be guardianship \nwith grandma.  However, if it is determined that it is \"possible\" to adopt the child, then that \ncould restrict access to the federal funding.  By changing that word to \"appropriate\" when \neveryone in the child's life agrees that this is the best case going forward, we do not have to \nhave legal arguments about whether it is \"possible\" for grandma to adopt.  If grandma wants \nthe kid, she should adopt the kid, and that will come with an adoption subsidy.  In a narrow \nset of cases, we get into a legal argument that is unnecessarily restrictive just because of the \nway it is currently drafted in NRS.  Whenever it is possible and appropriate, this will allow \nus to get these families the federal funding.  This slight tweak in NRS will ensure we are \ngiving those families that federal funding. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you for that clarification.  To further clarify, this makes it a lot easier in situations \nwith  grandma  such  as  those  Assemblywoman  Thomas  and  Assemblywoman  Summers-\nArmstrong mentioned. \n \nBailey Bortolin: \nYes. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nThe program is run through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program.  I want \nto say that there is an income threshold, so some people might not be eligible for it just \nbecause they do not meet a certain percentage of poverty.  I think 275 percent of the federal \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 24, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \npoverty level is what the qualifying guideline is.  Everyone who qualifies financially and is \ntaking in a relative or kin—and kin is defined—can get this.  If there are people out there \nwho are not getting this, it is because they are not eligible.  There is still an eligibility piece, \nand that might be a consideration for people who have incomes higher than what the federal \npoverty level is calling for on this. \n \nFurther down in the statute, there is language on adoptions saying that enrollment in this \nprogram should not hold up or in any negative way affect the possibility of adoption down \nthe road, and I think it says those adoption subsidies as well.  That is important to know.  \nWhen this was put in statute in 2011, there was a lot of consideration for that.  We did not \nwant to inadvertently create a financial incentive to have to choose a path to walk down such \nas, do you want to do guardianship now and never adopt, or do we want to leave all doors \nopen for that child to have permanency with their family?  I think we have that covered.  \nI just know that, in this bill, we do not see that piece of the statute, but I believe it does still \nexist in statute. \n \nBailey Bortolin: \nYes, there are a lot of considerations that go into this; however, in this bill, we are looking at \none consideration where we have found that the NRS in some cases has been interpreted to \nbe unnecessarily restrictive.  You will still have to otherwise qualify for the program, but the \nunfortunate situation we have seen happen is when everyone agrees that grandma should take \nthe child—that is the plan and what all parties involved want the plan to be—and we have \nactually seen the guardianship be granted by the court as a permanency plan, but the KinGAP \nfederal funding has not been attached to it which leaves grandma with a financial hardship.  \nIn some cases that relationship will no longer be sustainable, and the child will end up back \nin  the  child  welfare  system.    The  funding  is  not  necessarily  indicative  of  whether  the \nguardianship  will  be  granted,  it  is  whether  the  guardianship  will  come  with  financial \nassistance.  In those cases, this will help the family members have access to that additional \nsupport when appropriate and when they otherwise qualify through the program. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI think the longest piece of becoming licensed is completing the fingerprint and background \nchecks, so you are waiting for that process to play through.  It would probably be tricky to try \nto adjust or undo that because it has all kinds of implications.  It can either take 90 days or \nthree months, whichever comes faster.  \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there further questions from Committee members?  Seeing none, I will begin testimony \nin support of S.B. 158 (R1). \n \nKendall Lyons, Director of Health Policy, Children's Advocacy Alliance: \nFor the reasons that have already been stated you have our support, and I wanted to reaffirm \nit here with you today. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 24, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nKendra  G.  Bertschy,  Deputy  Public  Defender,  Washoe  County  Public  Defender's \nOffice: \nMy office represents parents in those dependency NRS Chapter 432B cases.  We are in \nsupport of this legislation.  To add to what Ms. Bortolin was saying, when I was a children's \nattorney,  I  had  several  cases  in  which  we  had  this  issue  where  everyone  wanted  the \ngrandparent or the relative—the aunt, uncle, sibling—to have that child and where it was best \nfor the child to remain with the family member, but because the plan had to be guardianship \nand there was no financial support, that added a lot of angst and issues for the entire family.  \nI urge your support of this bill. \n \nJoanna Jacob, Manager, Government Affairs, Clark County: \nWe worked with legal aid and stakeholders on this bill during the interim leading up to this \nlegislative session.  I want to put on the record that a great number of our foster care kids are \nwith relatives and in relative placement.  As of March 2021, we had over 1,100 children who \nwere staying with their relatives.  It is something Clark County supports. \n \nI also want to put on the record that what we are talking about here is the subsidy.  It was \nimportant to Clark County that we have the language in this bill mirror the federal Title IV-E \nlanguage so we can get financial assistance to our relative placements.  We need them to be \nin that placement.  You will see in the bill that they have to be with that relative for six \nmonths.  During that time we work with our relatives to get them licensed, and we have \nexpedited licensing procedures.  If the licensing is delayed, it delays the subsidy.  It is not \na situation in which we would remove the child from that family placement.  We want to \navoid disruptions to the fullest extent possible, and I wanted to state that for the record. \n \nWe appreciate legal aid's goal in working on this bill.  Because of the language that was in \nthe statute, there were some issues with how that language was being interpreted.  That is \nwhy we worked with them on this bill to mirror the federal Title IV-E language which will \nenable us to get the financial support to our families.  To Assemblywoman Thomas and \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong, if you would like me to follow up with you about \nthat process, especially if you have seen some issues in your communities, I would be happy \nto do that after the hearing. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any testimony on the line in support of S.B. 158 (R1)?  [There was none.]  \nIs there any testimony in opposition to S.B. 158 (R1)?  [There was none.]  Is there any \ntestimony in neutral on S.B. 158 (R1)?  [There was none.]  With that, I will call our bill \npresenter back up to the table for any closing remarks. \n \nGillian Block: \nI will reiterate that this bill makes a small change to a narrow piece of the NRS to ensure that \nthe eligibility requirements are not more restrictive than federal requirements and creates and \nexpands opportunities for families and for children.  Thank you for hearing the bill today. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 24, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAt this time, I will close the hearing on S.B. 158 (R1) and open the hearing on Senate Bill \n175 (1st Reprint). \n \nSenate Bill 175 (1st Reprint):  Enacts provisions relating to lupus. (BDR 40-8) \n \nSenator Dina Neal, Senate District No. 4: \nI am here to present Senate Bill 175 (1st Reprint).  Senate Bill 175 (1st Reprint) is legislation \nI brought forth on lupus.  I have been trying to tackle a couple of diseases that are considered \ninvisible diseases.  Last session I tackled sickle cell anemia; this session I was going after \nlupus  because  it  is  one  of  the  diseases  that  is  hard  to  diagnose,  affects  predominantly \nwomen, and predominantly affects women of color—Hispanic and African American.  I have \na copresenter who may be on Zoom.  She is a member of the Lupus of Nevada organization.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIf you are on Zoom, please unmute yourself.  No, I do not see her. \n \nSenator Neal: \nIn  your  exhibits  there  should  be  some  data  concerning  emergency  visits  and  inpatient \nadmissions from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, giving you the specific \ndata on Nevada [Exhibit G].  There was a second document uploaded titled \"National Public \nHealth Agenda for Lupus 2015: A Blueprint for Action\" [Exhibit H].  I submitted those \ntwo exhibits because the bill helps us to align with the national policy agenda around lupus.  \nThe first document also shows lupus-related emergency department visits by demographics \nand sex and lays out the number of visits, roughly about 1,500 total admissions [page 1, \nExhibit G].  This is the data we currently have, and this bill would expand that dataset and \nallow us to grow in terms of the variants we would be able to identify. \n \nGetting  into  S.B.  175  (R1),  sections  2  through  12  give  definitions.    Section  4  is  very \nimportant because there are four types of lupus.  This bill would get documentation about \nsystemic  lupus,  cutaneous  lupus,  drug-induced  lupus,  and  neonatal  lupus  which  affects \nnewborns.  Section 5 lays out the duties of the Chief Medical Officer and what that person \nwould be responsible for doing.  We are creating a registry and a system so that the record \nand the cases of lupus and its variants are reported to the state.  The Chief Medical Officer is \nresponsible for conducting a comprehensive epidemiologic survey of lupus and evaluating \nthe appropriateness of the measures for the treatment of lupus and its variants.  It also \nincludes how hospitals, medical laboratories, and other facilities are a part of this reporting \nscheme because they are on the front lines providing screening, diagnostics, and therapeutic \nservices to patients with respect to lupus.  They shall report their information to the State \nBoard of Health of the Department of Health and Human Services.  Also in section 5, \nsubsection 4, it states, \"Any provider of health care who diagnoses or provides treatment for \nlupus and its variants, except for cases directly referred to the provider . . .\" must also report \nthe information.   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 24, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nWhen you get to section 6, this lays out the information that is required to be kept based on \nS.B. 175 (R1).  The State Board of Health, shall, by regulation, prescribe the manner in \nwhich information will be maintained:  basic name, address, age, and ethnicity of patient; the \nvariant of lupus; the method of treatment; any opioid prescribed for the patient and whether \nthe patient has adequate access to an opioid; and any other diseases from which the patient \nsuffers.  The reason why the diseases are important is because there can be several offshoots.  \nYou can end up with cardiovascular disease, stroke, rashes, painful joints, inflammation, \nfatigue, and some cognitive issues.  I met some patients over the summer, and there is a clear \ncase based on the women that they are being misdiagnosed when they go into the hospital.  \nIf Ms. Calvinia Williams had been on Zoom, she would have told you that in her situation \nthey believed she was having a stroke.  If the doctors had had their way, they would have \ngiven her medication which probably would have ultimately caused her death because what \nwas really happening was that she was having a lupus-related incident that needed to be \ndiagnosed.  It turned out that there was only one doctor who happened to pass her as she was \nlaying in the hallway, identified her symptoms, and was then able to treat her.  She is now \nliving with us today. \n \nI  ran  into  women  who,  when  encountering  issues  with  their  rheumatologists,  are  then \nchallenged with the care model being presented to them because they are being told that they \nare not really sick, that they do not have lupus, but yet they have been diagnosed for \nten years.  I recently heard a story about a woman who had been on lupus medication for the \npast 20 years then ran into her rheumatologist who took her off all medications and placed \nher on Tylenol for her pain and inflammation.  Tylenol has the effect of damaging kidneys in \nlupus patients, so she is now in a pickle because they are saying that she is a problem patient \nrather than listening to her and understanding that she knows her care better than anyone else \nand that she is trying to tell the doctor exactly what is going on with her, but yet he is not \nhearing her.  Now she is in a state of panic because she needs to find another doctor who can \ntake care of her.  She is worried about the absence of the medications because he removed \nthose medications from her, and now she is on nothing and trying to figure out how she can \ntell her story to a physician and, hopefully, get to a primary care physician who can get her \nback on her medications and manage her care.   \n \nThis is an invisible population.  It is very important that we document the  method of \ntreatment, which is in section 6, subsection 2, paragraph (c), any other diseases that the \npatient suffers from [paragraph (d)], and the information concerning the usage and access to \nhealth care services by the patient [paragraph (e)].  That is key because they are running into \nroadblocks in terms of their access to health care and it being properly established that they \nare lupus patients and not something else.  The bill talks about confidentiality, which is in \nsection 6, subsection 3, and that there will be a protocol established by the State Board of \nHealth around the appropriateness for access to and preserving the confidentiality of the \nrecords of the patients needed for the research into lupus and its variants.  In section 7, the \nchief administrative officer of the health care facility shall make available to the Chief \nMedical Officer, or his or her representative, information around each case of lupus and its \nvariants.  The Division of Public and Behavioral Health within the Department of Health and \nHuman  Services  has  the  responsibility  to  abstract  from  those  records  information  and \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 24, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \ncompile it in a timely manner, not later than six months after the Division abstracts the \ninformation or receives the information from the health care facility, what is going on with \nlupus and the lupus variants.  There is a timeline.   \n \nSection 8 is the reporting and what the report shall be based on and references sections 5, 6, \nand 7.  Based on the information obtained pursuant to sections 5, 6, and 7 of the bill, the \nDivision shall make other appropriate uses of the information to report and assess trends.  \nThat is very important because this section is going to assess the trends in the usage of and \naccess to health care services by the patients with lupus and its variants in a particular area or \npopulation.  It will also be important for this section to be applied because they will advance \nresearch and education concerning lupus.  There are several organizations already in play on \nthe national level.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been running \nsurveillance projects in a couple of other states.  It would be nice if, once we pass this bill \nand get aligned with the national standards, we could become a part of a surveillance project \nand start to develop and lift up these patients so we can identify their associated disorders and \nthe variants and the access-to-care issues they are facing.   \n \nFurther on in section 8, subsection 1, paragraphs (a), (b), and (c), it lays out the information \nconcerning the locations in which patients diagnosed with lupus and its variants reside, the \ndemographics of those patients, the utilization, and the information in paragraph (b) specific \nto patients diagnosed with lupus and its variants who are over 60 years of age, and the \ntransition of patients diagnosed with lupus and its variants from pediatric to adults upon \nreaching 18 years of age.  This is important because the continuity of care is important for \na young person who may have been diagnosed before age 18 and what that continuity of care \nwill be from rheumatologist to rheumatologist.  If they are coming from another state, this \nwill also allow them to at least have some kind of connection to build that transition.  This \nlanguage was similar to an issue I dealt with in sickle cell patients because they literally had \na drop-off at age 18.  Because of the drop-off at age 18, there was an absence of care between \nbecoming the age of majority and then having to find their own health care—a primary care \nphysician and a rheumatologist who would help them continue their medications and be able \nto manage their disease. \n \nIn section 9, the Chief Medical Officer or any qualified person or designee shall analyze this \ninformation pursuant to sections 5, 6, and 7.  In section 9, subsection 2, the Chief Medical \nOfficer or designee will determine if there is a trend that exists in the usage of and access to \nhealth care.  This is important because it lays out that after they make the determination, they \nare then supposed to work with appropriate government, educational, and research entities to \ninvestigate the trends and advance research into the trends and facilitate the treatment of \nlupus and its variants and associated disorders. \n \nSection 10 allows the Division to apply for and accept grants, gifts, and donations to carry \nout sections 2 through 12, and continues to discuss how they are going to coordinate and \nadminister any other state programs related to lupus.  I wanted to make sure this bill tied \nthem into any federal activity or any state activity going on so they are coordinating at every \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 24, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nchance they possibly can with other states to move themselves ahead.  With that, I am open \nfor any questions. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you, Senator Neal.  Go ahead, Assemblywoman Titus. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI appreciate your bringing this forward, and I absolutely share your passion and caring for \nyour constituents and all Nevadans.  I have a couple of technical questions about the bill.  \nUnder section 5, subsection 3, you mention that hospitals, medical labs, and other facilities \nshould provide screening, et cetera, and that you have to provide that information unless it \nhas been provided by someone else.  How would they know that, so as to prevent double \nreporting?  How will they know it has already been provided? \n \nSenator Neal: \nThat will be a key piece that the Department will have to deal with.  For the data, right now \nwe are using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes in order to identify \nwhether they went to an emergency room or have inpatient care.  There is an absence of data, \nso this bill would help refine and make sure we are not getting double the information.  We \ndo not have the full set of data we need in order to do the analysis and determine access to \ncare and the treatments around the variants.  That is what I thought was unique.  When \nI asked what data they actually had on lupus, I asked that the biostatistician send me anything \nthey had on lupus.  That is why I uploaded what I did receive in the exhibits because we need \nto actually collect data.  I cannot tell you that it will not be duplicated.  We need to get into \nthe fray and find out what is there, pull it from all the areas, and then do the analysis.  From \nthat benchmark, we need to make sure that the standard of the information being recorded is \njust coming from one entity.  I do know that there is a small subset outside of the hospital \nbecause they either see a rheumatologist or a primary care doctor. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nAs a primary care doctor, a family practice doctor, I have seen many patients who thought \nthey might have lupus or who were subsequently diagnosed with lupus, so it is not something \njust limited to women of color.  It is throughout the spectrum, but especially in women.  \nGetting in to see a rheumatologist is the X factor.  We have to do all these tests prior because \nwe have so few rheumatologists in the state.  Before I could refer a patient, I would have to \nsend all the tests I ordered.  In order to get permission from their insurance companies to \nobtain  the  tests,  I  would  have  to  use  an  ICD-9  code  to  justify  the  tests,  so  I  wanted \nclarification  on  how  they  were  reporting  and  on  duplication  of  reporting.    I  certainly \nunderstand your comment that in order to even start, we have to have some sort of template \nto get started with the data.  Then we can go through it later.  Do any other states have this \nmodel?  Would Nevada be the first state that does this, or are you using some other state's \nsuccesses? \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 24, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \nSenator Neal: \nI pretty much built this bill off my sickle cell bill, but they are doing it in California.  It is my \nunderstanding that they are also doing some work in New York and Georgia and maybe in \nanother state.  In 2011, Illinois passed a lupus education awareness act; in 2014, Georgia \ncreated a council on lupus for education awareness, so other states have done different \nvariations.  California has been the surveillance project that has been with the CDC, but \nIllinois and Georgia focus more on education awareness.  This bill, S.B. 175 (R1), is getting \ninto reporting and doing a registry which I was trying to match with what California is doing. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank you for that, and thank you for your passion, Senator Neal. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nNext we will go to a question from Assemblywoman Thomas. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nI love the bill and I would also like to be a cosponsor on the bill.  I know this is crunch time, \nbut, for the record, I would like to note that.  My question concerns the reports.  After all the \nreports are in, is there a way for the Legislature to get the reports so they do not just sit on \nsomeone's desk collecting dust? \n \nSenator Neal: \nI want to acknowledge Assemblywoman Titus because what she said is true.  If you look at \nthe data, 88 percent of people with lupus are women.  To your question, Assemblywoman \nThomas, I have not considered giving this information to the Legislature because the reverse \nmay occur—reports sit on legislators' desks, so I have more interest in it going to the \nDepartment where they are more engaged and active in looking at the information.  The way \nthe bill is set up, the Chief Medical Officer will engage in analysis and do an assessment to \ndetermine trends.  If it went to the Legislature, you would see it as a report—and we get \nmany reports.  Unless you specifically look for it, it has value only to the person seeking it \nout.  I am not going to say this in a negative way, because we tie ourselves to legislative \nreports.  We believe that the Legislature is this esteemed body, but unless you are totally \nengaged  in  making  sure  something  happens—following  your  legislation,  looking  at  the \nreports, the data, and acting upon those agencies—that is the only value of the legislative \nreport.  You have to actually make the Legislature, esteemed body that it is, have the power \nand authority to go to the person and say, You have not responded to this data and I need you \nto respond to this data.  For now, I am going to keep it with the Department of Health and \nHuman Services. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nThank you, Senator Neal, I appreciate that, but I also had a vested interest.  You mentioned \nneonatal lupus.  I am very concerned about that. \n \nSenator Neal: \nI will add you to my bill. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 24, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \nAssemblyman Matthews: \nI appreciate the question from Assemblywoman Titus, as I was curious along those same \nlines.  In response, I think you said that California has a registry along these lines.  Could you \nspeak to what they are doing with that information?  Has it led to policy changes, or are \npolicy changes in the works?  Have there been any changes or improvements in health \noutcomes?  I guess that would depend partially on how old the registry is or how long they \nhave been doing this, but I was hoping you could speak to what has occurred in California as \na result of this. \n \nSenator Neal: \nCalifornia attempted legislation twice, once in 2011.  It did not pass then, so they tried again \nin 2014, and then they got connected to the CDC.  It is my understanding that the work they \nhave been doing is a part of the National Lupus Patient Registry.  They have managed to get \nconsecutive funding from Congress of about $9.5 million.  They also funded $10 million for \na lupus research program in which California—and possibly Georgia—is a part of the CDC's \nsurveillance project.  In addition, in 2020 because of the work that has been happening—\ngiving information to the CDC and the national group—they got $2 million for the lupus \nprogram.  Also, the National Institutes of Health, the largest public funder of research, was \ngiven an increase of $1.25 billion.  It is my understanding that, since roughly 2014, they have \nbeen building this National Lupus Patient Registry and they have been able to leverage \nfunding and create research programs in order to help other states.   \n \nI wanted S.B. 175 (R1) to become a part of this national work and that Nevada get into play.  \nI did not find out that we were behind the times until I got this document from Director \nRichard Whitley who told me that S.B. 175 (R1) aligned with a 2015 agenda around lupus \nwork.  Since it is now 2021, I said we should get in the game—we are six years behind—and \nstart playing in this national work. \n \nAssemblyman Matthews: \nIn terms of the initial consequences in California, it has resulted in access to additional \nfunding.  It is perhaps premature to say whether that is getting us on the road, presumably to \nimproved health outcomes and changes in policy beyond that.  They are still in the phase of \nbringing in financial funding for this at this point.  Is that correct? \n \nSenator Neal: \nThe latest report from the CDC said that they were able to document 16,000 new cases per \nyear.  I think the registry has helped them reach that 16,000-per-year number.  I would not \nsay that they are in the forming stages.  They probably started at an infant stage around 2014 \nor 2015, and then they have successfully grown.  I just want Nevada to be a player because \nwe have a lupus population here that feels as though they are drowning and not a part of the \ncare.  Ms. Calvinia Williams created an organization in order to do the work in Las Vegas \nand is doing it all on her own, reaching out to women.  This gives her a chance to take the \nwork she has done and leverage it into the state and, hopefully, into a national conversation \nto say that Nevada has lupus patients who need to be a part of the work. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 24, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nThank you for bringing this bill.  We have a familial connection with lupus, and it is a pretty \nterrifying  disease  with  the  unknowns  and  some  of  the  ways  it  expresses  itself.    The \ninformation  around  it  is  not  readily  available.    My  question  is  about  the  reporting \nexpectations in the bill.  Are you expecting that the reporting would be defined through the \nregulatory structure? \n \nSenator Neal: \nYes.  In section 6 it is by regulation. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nFrom there, are you expecting that the regulations will ask for reporting per case or on an \nannual basis?  By which provider will this happen, the individual provider or the facility in \nwhich the provider works? \n \nSenator Neal: \nThe intent is that whether it be a hospital, medical laboratory, or other facility that is either \nproviding the screening or the diagnostic or therapeutic services, they are reporting that \ninformation to the State Board of Health.  That is the goal. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nWill that be annual, or is it more important to get it up-front and see it as the diagnosis \nis happening? \n \nSenator Neal: \nIt is supposed to be happening when they go, within that six-month window.  It is not \nannually, but they will be reporting when those cases come through, and there should be \na compiling moment.  In section 7, subsection 2 where it says, \". . . the manner and not later \nthan 6 months . . .\" the Division abstracts the information and then we have the analysis that \noccurs.  We are collecting, then we are going to abstract the information, then we are going \nto do the analysis to determine if there are trends.  \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any other questions from members?  Seeing none, at this time I will begin \ntestimony in support of S.B. 175 (R1). \n \nCalvinia Williams, Founder and President, Lupus of Nevada, Inc.: \nSenator Dina Neal, thank you so much, and I would also like to thank the Committee on \nHealth and Human Services. I am pleased.  Lupus of Nevada, Inc., our agency, is advocacy \nand  education  awareness.    One  of  the  things  we  want  to  see  with  S.B.  175  (R1)  is \naccountability, the reporting process in this.  When our lupus individuals go to the doctors, \nand this has been over 17 years in Nevada doing this, they will come out with no answers at \nall.  The second thing I would like to have is the demographics of this.  That is what we \nreally wanted, to hold that accountable so the registry can get their hands on it and we can \nfight to get grants.  We do not know how many people in Nevada have it.  My people call me \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 24, 2021 \nPage 27 \n \ndaily complaining about the fact that they went into their doctor, went to California, have \nbeen diagnosed for 16 years, moved here 6 months ago, one physician told them they did not \nhave lupus, took all their medicine away, and now they are told to get on Tylenol.  We need \naccountability with this because we need to figure out what is going on for someone who has \nbeen on medication for 16 years.  Now this individual does not have any doctor.  I get \nconcerned and agitated because I am a major advocate for this.  We need your help, and this \nbill is going to do it for us.  It is going to set boundaries and standards determined by the \ndiversity of the people who have it here in the west side, the south, the southwest.  A lot of \npeople are not going to the doctors because they are not going to get the outcomes that they \nare expecting to get.  That is why I feel it is so important for this bill. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIs there anyone else to testify in support?  [There was no one.]  Next, I will go to testimony in \nopposition to S.B. 175 (R1).  [There was none.]  Do we have anyone testifying in neutral?  \n[There was no one.]  With that, I will call our bill sponsor up to make any closing remarks. \n \nSenator Neal: \nI want to thank the Committee for hearing S.B. 175 (R1).  If this bill gets out, it will do really \ngood work for patients who have an autoimmune disease who want to have proper care and \ntransparency around their disease.  Thank you for your time. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWith that, I will close the hearing on S.B. 175 (R1) and open the hearing on Senate Bill 318 \n(1st Reprint).               \n \nSenate Bill 318 (1st Reprint):  Makes various changes relating to improving access to \ngovernmental  services  for  persons  with  limited  English  proficiency. \n(BDR 40-955) \n \nSenator Fabian Donate, Senate District No. 10: \nToday's conversation on language access is something that is long overdue, and I am glad we \ncan be here to address a much-needed gap that is always ignored until it is too late.  The \nCOVID-19 pandemic has shown just how valuable information access can be for those who \nmay not have the adequate education or resources to understand and take part in relevant \nhealth  information.    Failing  to  prioritize  information  access  can  result  in  public  health \ndisinformation and distrust, which is in direct alignment to an environment that can foster \nvaccine hesitancy.  Vaccine hesitancy, as in the refusal of vaccines despite the availability of \nthese services, is a very real problem here in Nevada that will become apparent within the \nnext few weeks, especially as we begin to expand our reach to marginalized groups that have \nbeen abused and neglected for years. \n \nIn public health, we use the term \"health literacy\" to describe a person's ability to find, \nunderstand, and use information and services to inform health-related decisions and actions \nfor themselves and others around them.  Health literacy is an important thing to consider in \ndeveloping  programs  that  improve  the  community's  health  status,  mostly  because  it \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 24, 2021 \nPage 28 \n \nacknowledges any present limitations and emphasizes the ability to use health information, \nnot simply to just understand it.  To make well-informed decisions, health literacy skills are \nneeded.    This  means  that  the  wide  range  of  our  population  must  have  the  adequate \nfoundational knowledge of a health problem before even considering the implications that \nmay arise. \n \nAs legislators and public servants, the reality of this pandemic is that we have not done our \nbest with how this response has taken shape, mostly because we did not have the right \ninfrastructure in place to carry out a good response.  If we want to fix the disparities observed \nin communities of color, we have to take the right step to invest in public health services that \nwill achieve good outcomes.  The biggest takeaway from today is that health literacy starts at \nthe distribution of information, and information is accessible when it is done in a culturally \ncompetent manner within your own native language.  Your language is your culture, and \nyour culture can modulate your perceptions of what health can mean to you.  With the \npermission  of  the  Chair,  I  will  turn  this  over  to  Ms.  Olivia  Whiteley,  Western  States \nAdvocacy Officer from the Refugee Advocacy Lab, to give her remarks on the bill language \nand a brief rundown on the intended outcomes on Senate Bill 318 (1st Reprint).     \n \nOlivia Whiteley, Western States Advocacy Officer, Refugee Advocacy Lab: \nThank you, Chair Nguyen, and members of the Committee, for hearing S.B. 318 (R1) and \nallowing me the opportunity to speak to this critical proposal.  I will provide an overview of \nthe development of this bill, the components of the bill, and additional remarks related to the \noutcome of the bill. \n \nOver  the  past  several  months  I  have  surveyed  Nevada's  resettlement  agencies,  and  the \nnumber one shared concern of these agencies is language access, particularly for refugees \nwho speak uncommon languages.  Organizations that serve Nevada's refugees report that \nqualified interpretation and translation services are often unavailable as clients interact with \nessential state agencies and programs such as small business support or the Department of \nMotor Vehicles.  These barriers have been amplified with the onset of the pandemic, as \nreliable, up-to-date public health information regarding the coronavirus is continually needed \nto enable refugee and limited English proficient Nevadans to protect themselves and their \nfamilies. \n \nThis bill was drafted based upon similar legislation previously introduced in other states— \nincluding  Alaska,  Pennsylvania,  New  York,  Michigan,  California,  Hawaii,  Washington, \nIllinois, New Jersey, Virginia, and New Mexico—the Department of Justice's \"Language \nAccess  Assessment  and  Planning  Tool  for  Federally  Conducted  and  Federally  Assisted \nPrograms,\" and feedback from local community groups. \n \nSenate Bill 318 (1st Reprint) has two primary components.  First are the COVID-19 relief \nprovisions.  Senate Bill 318 (1st Reprint) requires the Division of Public and Behavioral \nHealth  of  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  and  each  health  district  or \ndepartment to record the preferred language of every individual who receives COVID-19 \nservices; provide limited English proficient individuals with interpretation services, either \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 24, 2021 \nPage 29 \n \nin-person or remotely; translate vital documents such as applications or notices related to \nCOVID-19;  translate  governmental  orders  related  to  COVID-19;  and  collaborate  with \ncommunity-based organizations to ensure all local languages are represented.   \n \nThe requirements for language services are proportionate to the number and language of \nlimited English proficient individuals served by the division or health district, ensuring \nsmaller health districts do not have to provide services in the same frequency or breadth as \nlarger health districts.  If a health district only serves individuals who speak Spanish, Arabic, \nand Hindi, that district only has to provide services in those languages.  The Division of \nPublic and Behavioral Health submitted a zero-dollar fiscal note for S.B. 318 (R1) as they \nalready  have  the  requisite  federal  funds  to  implement  the  provisions  of  section  2,  and \nsections 3 and 4 which apply to district health divisions and departments are operative \"to the \nextent that money is available for these purposes\" and intended to guide the appropriation of \nAmerican Rescue Plan Act of 2021 dollars.  Senator Donate spoke artfully to the critical \nnature of these provisions. \n \nSecond,  S.B.  318  (R1)  addresses  language  access  for  governmental  services  beyond \nCOVID-19 by requiring state agencies to create language access plans.  Each executive \nagency's language access plan is required to include: \n \n1.  An outline of existing regulations and compliance; \n \n2.  Demographic information on individuals served by the agency; \n \n3.  An inventory of current language services and training resources; \n \n4.  A review of COVID-19 language access measures; and \n \n5.  Estimates  of  additional  funding,  employees,  and  resources  necessary  to  meet \nidentified needs. \n \nSenate Bill 318 (1st Reprint) also requires a public comment period for the drafted language \naccess plans, to ensure the voices of interpreters, translators, and English-learner clients are \nadequately taken into consideration. \n \nOne point to be clear on is that S.B. 318 (R1) does not require agencies to implement their \nlanguage access plans, only to \"develop\" and \"revise\" the plans.  Section 7, subsection 4, of \nthe bill requires agencies to include implementation costs in their 2023-2025 budget requests, \nallowing  the  Legislature  to  consider  the  full  funding  required  for  the  implementation \nduring the next session.  Following the initial amendment of the bill which clarified the \ndistinction between planning and implementation, many agencies eliminated or significantly \ndecreased their fiscal notes [Exhibit I, Exhibit J, Exhibit K, and Exhibit L].   Senate Bill 318 \n(1st Reprint) is a relatively low-cost, first step toward ensuring language access throughout \nthe state.   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 24, 2021 \nPage 30 \n \nCurrently,  there  is  no  state-level  standardized  process  for  ensuring  state  agencies  take \nreasonable  steps  to  ensure  meaningful  access  to  eligible  limited  English  proficient \nindividuals.  There is no relevant statewide requirement in the Nevada Revised Statutes.  \nThere is no mention of linguistic accessibility in the 2020 State Administrative Manual.  \nThis prohibits a significant amount of Nevada's population from accessing public goods, \nservices,  or  benefits.    According  to  data  from  the  2019  American  Community  Survey \nfrom the U.S. Census Bureau, between 10.7 percent and 13.8 percent of Nevada's adults and \n5.8 percent of Nevada's children speak English less than very well. \n \nThe implications of a lack of statewide guidance or resources can be found in the following \ncase study.  Within the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), the Division of \nChild and Family Services (DCFS) has the most comprehensive set of publicly available \nlanguage  access  policies—a  limited  English  proficiency  (LEP)  policy  from  2017,  and \na culturally and linguistically appropriate services policy from 2018.  These policies contain \nseveral praiseworthy components that S.B. 318 (R1) would require of all agencies.  However, \neven these policies are four to five years old and lack standardization.  For example, the \nculturally and linguistically appropriate services policy defines an interpreter or translator as \nan  individual  who  has  a  bachelor's  degree  from  an  accredited  institution,  preferably  in \nlanguages or linguistics, and possesses at least one year of specialized experience, while the \nLEP  policy  has  no  such  definition  or  qualifications  requirement.    As  both  policies  are \nspecific to the same program area within DCFS, Children's Mental Health Services, this \nfundamental determination of who is competent to interpret or translate treatment options, \neligibility requirements, or medical conditions to parents whose children are facing mental \nhealth difficulties should be standardized. \n \nIf you look through other publicly available DHHS LEP policies, you will see a further lack \nof standardization.  Some of these policies are a single paragraph, and some are not publicly \navailable.  The agency or division an individual is dealing with should not determine an \nindividual's ability to access essential information in their preferred language about programs \nthat they are eligible for but which are funded by their tax dollars—nor should an individual's \nZIP Code. \n \nIt is possible and likely that the agency and its divisions have additional policies, plans, and \nresources for ensuring language access that are not readily available to the public.  Further, \nthis is not intended as a comprehensive evaluation of the existing language access work of \nthese departments.  Across the state agencies and departments we have spoken with, all have \nexpressed a very strong desire to expand their language access offerings, but have a general \nlack of resources to do so.  Senate Bill 318 (1st Reprint) provides a statutory basis for all \nagencies to include funding to support the implementation of their language access plans in \ntheir biennial budget requests, bridging the gap between agency intent and the resources \navailable to each agency.   \n \nMy final remark, and perhaps my most important remark, is that S.B. 318 (R1) is a civil \nrights issue that underlines all other activities of this Committee.  One primary objective, if \nnot the primary objective, of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was to prevent the discriminatory \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 24, 2021 \nPage 31 \n \nuse of public funds, ensuring that all who paid taxes were able to access the goods and \nservices  those  dollars  subsidized.    The  Act's  prohibition  of  discrimination  on  the  basis \nof national origin was explicitly extended to language access in the Supreme Court's 1974 \nLau v. Nichols decision.  Senate Bill 318 (1st Reprint) attempts to actualize those protections \nand  that  promise  that  all  Nevadans,  regardless  of  language,  can  access  governmental \nservices.  Every bill, program, or full-time employee currently under consideration by this \nCommittee, each of those is only a just use of taxpayer dollars if all Nevadans—Spanish-\nspeaking,  Lingala-speaking,  or  Kinyarwanda-speaking—can  understand  the  related \napplication forms, notices, or systems to have the needs of their families be understood by \nstaff.  I humbly ask Committee members to invest in this two-year, civil rights planning \nexercise, and I am now open to questions. \n \n[Assemblywoman Peters assumed the Chair.] \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nDo we have questions from the Committee?  [There were none.]  I had a question related to \nsome of the exhibits that were provided for this hearing.  It looks like most of your fiscal \nnotes  have  been  removed.    To  be  clear,  this  is  a  policy  committee  and  not  the  fiscal \ncommittee, but I am curious about these removals post-passage from your house.  Are any \nfiscal notes still retained and, if not, why did the amendment not get them all removed? \n \nSenator Donate: \nOver the last couple of  months we have had extensive conversations with each of the \ndepartments and agencies as to how this would be implemented once it becomes law.  I think \nit is very clear from our conversations with each of the agencies and departments that this is \nsomething they have wanted for a very long time, but the question is how do we get to \nlanguage access?   \n \nPart of the amendment we submitted in the Senate was to reiterate to the departments and \nagencies that Ms. Whiteley and I are not looking for implementation.  We are looking for \nthem to determine what they need to implement language access.  That has been made clear \nby the fiscal notes that have been removed.  There is only one fiscal note outstanding, and \nthat is with the Department of Corrections.  We made clear to them that our bill only creates \nan access plan and is simply an exercise and not for implementation. \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nThank you. I did look at some of that language and the fiscal note.  It is my understanding \nfrom your language that you are not requiring an additional person, just somebody who may \nhave  interest  in  this  who  can  champion  it  through  their  offices.    Are  there  any  other \nquestions?     \n   \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nThank you for this bill.  In previous conversations, the intersection between language access \nand health equity is the new, big policy frontier we are going to have to battle moving \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 24, 2021 \nPage 32 \n \nforward.  Future Legislatures will decide whether we do it piecemeal, statute-by-statute, \nor here and there.   \n \nSection 7 deals with a language access plan for the Executive Department.  Can you tell me \nmore about what you would hope to see as that work product?  When I look at some of the \npieces, some have more readily handy data and would not necessarily need a new way to pull \nup that data.  For instance, section 7, subsection 2, paragraph (b), talks about the relevant \ndemographics.  If we are looking at Health and Human Services, Medicaid, or Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families, there is lots of data on demographics there.  For some other \ndepartments, tell me more about the type of work product you are hoping to see from them. \n \nSenator Donate: \nI will turn that over to Ms. Olivia Whiteley, who can speak more to that. \n \nOlivia Whiteley: \nThere are a couple of outcomes we are hoping to see from the language access plans that are \nrequired under section 7.  One of the primary purposes for creating the plans required under \nsection 7 would be to allow agencies to develop a robust, detailed understanding of what \ncosts would be associated with implementing that language access plan and ensuring that all \nNevadans could understand and access their services.  The bill requires agencies to submit \nthat fiscal note in the 2023-2025 biennium so that can be a discussion occurring in the \nLegislature during that period.  All the language access planning components are purposed \ntoward ensuring that agencies can then take that next step to implementation. \n \nIn regard to the content of the plan, you are correct in that, first, it does require agencies to \ngather demographic data; this can be done in a couple of different ways.  Second it requires \nagencies to include in their language access plans an inventory of existing services.  This \ninventory was based off the U.S. Department of Justice's language access assessment and \nplanning tools.  It goes through things like what training is provided to employees, and it is \nfairly specific.  It asks them if they provide employees with training on how to talk with \na limited English proficient individual over the phone, via email, or in person; so it goes \nthrough  a  checklist  of those  existing  services.    The language  access  plan also requires \nagencies to report on ways where laws might need to be modified to better serve limited \nEnglish proficient Nevadans.  It requires agencies to evaluate where areas that translator and \ninterpreter certifications are not listed for their particular agency activities.  Perhaps in \nconjunction, there would be workforce development opportunities.  Sometimes for these less \nfrequently  spoken  languages,  there  is  even  a  lack  of  local  interpretation  or  translation \nresources available for agencies to use, so it also attempts to fill some of those gaps.  \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI appreciate that.  I know it is a long, hard road.  I already have a June 10 meeting on my \ncalendar for the Information Technology Advisory Board.  It is the committee that looks at \nthe technology of the state.  Obviously, our meetings were disrupted during the pandemic, \nbut in that committee we talk about the work just to become compliant with the Americans \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 24, 2021 \nPage 33 \n \nwith Disabilities Act (ADA).  The last comment from about six months ago was that we are \nmore than a decade away from being fully ADA-compliant just on our state's websites.   \n \nWhat I have learned is, wherever you can fit it in to different pieces as they are moving, jump \non it there.  As long as we are having the conversation about modernizing some of our \nsystems  and  we  talk about  accessibility,  we  should  make  sure to  add  language to  that \naccessibility as well.  For those pieces we are starting to modernize now, at least we can look \nat a language component and play catch-up on everything else.  As much as you can, I would \nhope you would want this section to be liberally construed to make sure that the Executive \nBranch departments, where they see an opportunity to do this work, that they can.  It may not \nbe a symmetrical kind of progress; it might be asymmetrical where you will see certain \ndepartments moving ahead of others.  Some may be more organically equipped and come at \nthis from a different direction than others.  You can tell by the fiscal notes we get from some \ndepartments when we ask for culture change—systemic culture change—how willing they \nare.  That is the first bellwether as to who is interested in doing this or not.  I think it is \nheaded in the right direction.  Hopefully, they will engage in this work in a meaningful way.  \nI understand that they are busy, but this will lead us to a better place. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nSenator Donate, thank you for bringing this forward.  This problem is real.  During this \nCOVID-19 epidemic we had significant issues reaching out to our guest worker programs in \nmy community.  We bring in a huge number of guest workers and needed to make sure they \nhad information regarding COVID-19 and knew the measures to be taken such as washing \nhands, social distancing, and wearing masks, whatever those measures were.  Initially the \ninformation was not in Spanish, which is the language of our guest workers.  I want this on \nthe record now that I reached out to Assemblyman Flores and Assemblywoman Torres to \nhelp me put together information even though the state had information out there.  I asked for \nhelp interpreting that information, and I got recommendations; so having a process, not only \nin Spanish, but also in a format that someone reading it would understand and not be \nthreatened by.  This was more a comment, but I wanted to thank you for bringing this \nforward.  I think this is important, and for those doubters, it was a significant aha moment for \nme this last summer when we could not get the information out that we needed to get out, not \nonly in their language, but in whatever the translation was they would accept and trust.  The \nhealth care system is all about building trust.  We do not just want some bureaucrat to write it \nin  Spanish,  which  was  not  really  their  language  anyway.    It  was  a  textbook  kind  of \ninterpretation, so I think there is a huge need here. \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nAre there any more questions from the Committee?  Seeing none, we will move on to support \ntestimony on S.B. 318 (R1). \n \nManuel  Mederos,  Language  Access  Specialist,  Language  Bank,  Northern  Nevada \nInternational Center, University of Nevada, Reno: \nI run a program called the Language Bank.  I am giving testimony in full support of S.B. 318 \n(R1) because it is critical that each Nevada state agency is really able to create their own \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 24, 2021 \nPage 34 \n \nlanguage access plan.  This plan would help state agencies meet the language needs of \nNevadans experiencing significant barriers to accessing state services related to COVID-19 \ndue to the lack of materials and information translated.  I cannot say enough and emphasize \nenough the importance of providing appropriate access to language services which would \nprovide  much-needed  culturally  and  linguistically  appropriate  services  to  our  growing, \ndiverse communities.  As many of you have recognized today, Nevada is an extremely \ndiverse state.  It is beyond Spanish; it is beyond English; there are a multitude of languages in \nour state.  Providing [unintelligible] services to clients regardless of their spoken language is \na  crucial  component  in  the  provision  of  trauma-informed,  nondiscriminatory,  safe  and \neffective assistance to all members of our communities throughout our wonderful state of \nNevada.  Today, the focus is COVID-19; however, in the future, it could be something else—\na disaster of some sort, another pandemic, or a statewide emergency.  This bill would allow \neach state agency and personnel to make language access plans appropriately.  Furthermore, \nthis bill would allow and help state agencies train their personnel so that they can effectively \ncommunicate  with  limited  English  individuals  and  can  effectively  work  with  language \ninterpreters. \n \nLastly, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted nearly every aspect of our lives and reached \ninto nearly every community in our state.  Our ability to keep one another safe and healthy \ndepends on every Nevadan having access to credible, trusted information about how to \nprevent the spread of COVID-19, the types of supports and services available, and how to \ncomply  with  federal  and  state  and  local  orders.    We  know  certain  communities  are \ndisproportionately impacted by this pandemic, and one way we can shift that injustice is by \nmeeting  our  obligation  to  communicate  in  ways  that  are  accessible  and  culturally  and \nlinguistically relevant.  We need S.B. 318 (R1) to ensure that our underserved communities \ncan access lifesaving information and care.  Thank you for hearing me today, and please \nsupport S.B. 318 (R1). \n  \nWilliam Pregman, Communications Director, Battle Born Progress: \nWe rise in support of S.B. 318 (R1).  Since the beginning of the pandemic, Nevada families \nwho either are not fluent in English or do not speak English as their primary language are \noften alienated from COVID-19 public resources.  Luckily, a network of community support \nensured these materials were translated to help folks connect with housing, health care, food, \nor other resource assistance they needed.  We thank Senator Donate for bringing forward this \nbill to provide information on state resources in multiple languages.  We support this effort to \nmake our social safety net accessible to all communities, regardless of which language they \nspeak so they have accurate information on how to find what they need.  We urge your \nsupport of this bill. \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nNext caller, please.  [There was no one.]  Is there anyone who would like to testify in \nopposition to S.B. 318 (R1)?  [There was no one.]  I will now ask for neutral testimony on \nS.B. 318 (R1). \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 24, 2021 \nPage 35 \n \nBradley Mayer, representing Southern Nevada Health District; and Washoe County \nHealth District: \nI wanted to acknowledge the sections of the bill that apply to us.  We really appreciate \nSenator Donate and Ms. Whiteley for working with us early on.  Senator Donate engaged us \nright away when this idea emerged.  He worked with us on the bill throughout the course of \nhearings in the other house to get it to a place where we can ensure maximum effectiveness \nfrom the health districts' perspective and execution of this, especially as it relates to money \nbeing available for these services.  We thank him, and we wanted to acknowledge that. \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nIs there other neutral testimony on S.B. 318 (R1)? \n \nMargarita  Salas  Crespo,  Senior  Advisor,  Office  for  New  Americans,  Office  of  the \nGovernor: \nI am testifying in neutral for S.B. 318 (R1).  The Office for New Americans in the Office of \nthe Governor was created to ensure the civic and economic integration and inclusion of \nimmigrants  and  refugees  in  the  state  of  Nevada  which  account  for  20  percent  of  the \npopulation in our state.  Providing language access services helps bridge the communication \nbarrier with individuals who cannot speak, understand, read, or write fluently in the host \ncountry language.  A Nevada language and demographic data report provided to our Office \nfor New Americans indicates that 5.2 percent of Nevada immigrants and refugees have \na limited English proficiency. \n \nSenate Bill 318 (1st Reprint) seeks to bridge the gap of communication by proactively \nensuring  that  the  Division  of  Public  and  Behavioral  Health  in  the  DHHS  and  each \ndistrict's  health department take reasonable measures to ensure that persons with limited \nEnglish proficiency have meaningful and timely access to services to restrain the threat of \nCOVID-19.  As we all know, immigrants and refugees and people of color have been \ndisproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and trying to ensure the access to \nbenefits and resources in a language they understand and in a culturally competent manner is \none way to ensure an equitable COVID-19 response.  In addition to addressing language \naccess for the COVID-19 response, section 7 of this bill requires each Executive Department \nof state government to develop and biennially revise a language access plan as an initial step \ntoward  ensuring  that  each  state  agency  provides  high-quality  and  appropriate  language \nservices to the constituency they serve.  A language access plan will help in the success of \nthe  state's  efforts  to  ensure  that  all  Nevadans  have  access  to  other  timely  and  vital \ninformation in the language they understand and in a culturally competent manner. \n \nSean  Sever,  Administrator,  Division  of  Management  Services  and  Programs, \nDepartment of Motor Vehicles: \nI want to comment on our fiscal note.  We are neutral on the bill, of course, but after \nreceiving clarification that the bill calls only for the formation of a language access plan and \nnot the actual implementation of the plan, we have determined that the Department of Motor \nVehicles' fiscal note can be revised to indicate there is no fiscal impact. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 24, 2021 \nPage 36 \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nThank you for putting that on the record.  As this is not the Ways and Means Committee, we \nwill ensure that is on the record for the bill and will pass that information on to our fiscal \ncommittee.  Is there anyone else on the line for neutral testimony?  [There was no one.]  Does \nthe bill sponsor have any closing remarks? \n \nSenator Donate: \nThank you so much for the opportunity to speak with you today.  I would like to share \none thing.  When I first started on this journey in the Senate, trying to decide which bills \nI wanted to push forward, I knew that language access in public health had to be one of \nthose priorities,  for  the  sake  of  my  family  and  for  the  greater  immigrant  community.  \nSenate Bill 318 (1st Reprint) is an effort that can address many of the observed gaps we see \nin translation of services and, most importantly, it reframes the conversation of increasing \naccess for the COVID-19 vaccine and for public health.

(BDR 39-\n431) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \nSenate Bill 69 (2nd Reprint) was heard on May 27, 2021 [read from Exhibit C].  It makes \nvarious changes related to behavioral health.  The bill removes provisions for the licensing \nand regulation of peer support recovery organizations and instead prescribes requirements for \nthe certification and regulation of persons who provide peer support recovery services for \ncompensation as a regular part of their job duties.  It makes the Nevada Certification Board \nresponsible  for  certifying  peer  recovery  support  specialists  and  peer  recovery  support \nspecialist supervisors.  If the Nevada Certification Board or its successor organization ceases \nto certify such persons, the bill makes the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services responsible for certifying and regulating these \nindividuals.   \n \nAdditionally, S.B. 69 (R2) requires Nevada's Department of Education to develop, maintain, \nand publish a list of evidence-based curricula and programs concerning substance misuse and \nsubstance use disorders.  The board of trustees of each school district and the governing body \nof each charter school must submit a report describing any such curricula or program used or \noffered during School Year 2020–2021 to the Legislative Committee on Education.  The bill \nalso requires public schools to participate in the biennial Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance \nSystem developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention but authorizes pupils \nand their parents or guardians to abstain from participation.   \n \nFinally, S.B. 69 (R2) requires the State Board of Health to adopt regulations providing for the \ncertification of substance use disorder prevention coalitions and prescribes the duties of a \ncertified substance use disorder prevention coalition.  There were no amendments. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre  there  any  questions?

It  revises  requirements  governing  a  petition  for  involuntary \ncourt-ordered  admission  and  requires  certain  notification  to  be  provided  if  a  person  is \nreleased or transferred to a different mental health facility or hospital.  Finally, the bill \nrequires courts to seal records governing proceedings involving a consumer in a mental \nhealth facility or a program of assisted outpatient treatment.

(BDR 40-563) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \nSenate Bill 211 (2nd Reprint) was heard on May 27, 2021 [read from Exhibit G].  It requires, \nwith certain exceptions, physicians, physician assistants, advanced practice registered nurses, \nor midwives who provide or supervise the provision of emergency medical services in a \nhospital or primary care to patients who are 15 years of age or older to consult with such \npatients to determine whether they wish to be tested for sexually transmitted diseases and to \ndetermine which tests, if any, are medically indicated and to test a patient who wishes to be \ntested accordingly.   \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 28, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nSenate Bill 211 (2nd Reprint) requires the State Board of Health to adopt regulations to \nensure that communications regarding testing are made in a culturally competent manner \nand, to the extent practicable, in a language easily understood by the patient.

By this time in the session, I am sure you are well \naware  that  there  are  five  regional  behavioral  health  policy  boards.    I  am  here  today \nrepresenting the coalition of folks in Washoe County who have been appointed to focus on \nbehavioral health needs in our region.  I think you all know each of the behavioral health \nboards gets a bill draft request (BDR), so this is the BDR coming forward on behalf of that \nboard.   \n \nIn the Senate early in the session we had a presentation that included six individuals and all \nkinds of information.  I suspect that is not what you are looking for at this point in the \nsession, so I am going to do most of the presentation, but I have a whole team of subject \nmatter experts when we get to questions.  In Washoe County, our process was that we put a \ncall out and asked the community to bring bill draft request ideas forward to us.  We had \nwonderful participation and received five or six distinct ideas for behavioral health policy \nthat the community would like to see us move forward.  Assemblywoman Peters and I, as \nindividuals, carried some of the bills that did not get selected, but what the board coalesced \naround was a bit of disappointment or frustration that, when we talk about behavioral health \nbroadly,  substance  use  disorder  often  gets  left  out  of  the  conversation.    Substance  use \ndisorder is clearly a part of behavioral health, so the Washoe County Regional Behavioral \nHealth Policy Board made the decision to focus explicitly on substance use disorder for our \nBDR, and then we tried to shove as many ideas in that BDR as we could. \n \nThis bill includes the certification of peer support specialists and their supervisors.  At the \nbeginning of the session, I did a presentation on the crisis continuum of care which would \nhave the call line, mobile crisis teams, and crisis stabilization centers.  As part of that \npresentation, I also talked about a specific workforce that would be important to that.  That \nwould be what we call \"peer recovery support specialists.\"  This is a workforce of peers with \nlived experience.  These are individuals who have experienced a behavioral health diagnosis, \nhave experienced a substance use disorder, and they become a very critical component as \npart of our health care teams.  We are getting tremendous evidence that if you have a \nbehavioral  health  professional—psychologist,  clinical  social  worker,  psychiatrist,  APRN \n[advanced practice registered nurse] with a psychiatric endorsement—and a peer, someone \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 27, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nwith lived experience, that a pair of folks working with a person who is experiencing either a \nsubstance use disorder or a diagnosis of a mental health issue—those individuals can be very \npowerful in terms of supporting and helping as part of the care team. \n \nBecause  that  is  becoming  more  and  more  recognized,  we  need  to  professionalize  that \nworkforce.  This is not a licensing process, this is not a burdensome, expensive, highly \ncredentialled licensing process; rather, it is a credentialling process that goes through a \nthird-party agency that already does credentialling for many similar types of individuals.  The \ncredentialling process becomes important because these peer support specialists get good \ntraining around ethics and boundaries, but they also are better positioned for the agencies \nwho want to hire them to be able to bill Medicaid for their services.  That becomes a more \nsustainable model in terms of being able to provide care in our community.   \n \nIt is really important that we get peers into the mix.  When you do get peers into the mix, you \nget a much better diversity of providers who are working with folks.  If you think about the \nmobile outreach teams, for example, that are going to be meeting people in their living rooms \nor on a street corner, having that peer makes all the difference in the world; the same in the \ncrisis stabilization centers where there are folks with lived experience in that living room \nmodel helping people recover.  That is the first part of the bill. \n \nThe second part of the bill is focused on substance use prevention.  It has three components.  \nFirst, it is seeking to do a better job of having evidence-based, substance use prevention in \nour school settings.  We already have substance use prevention requirements in our school \ncurriculum standards, but in the field, not all of the substance use prevention curriculum that \nis being delivered is actually evidence-based.  So the bill asks the Department of Education \nto publish a list of substance use curriculum that is evidence-based.  From a superintendent \non down to a classroom teacher, if you are interested in making sure that the substance use \nprevention curriculum you are doing in your classroom is going to be effective, you can look \nat this list and look for the evidence-based curriculum.   \n \nThe  bill  makes  some  technical  changes  to  the  youth  risk  behavior  surveillance  system \n(YRBSS).  The YRBSS is a survey we do regularly in schools that gives us the data we need \nto know we are targeting our prevention and intervention programs to the right areas.  Last, it \nprovides for some updated language on the certification of our substance use coalitions.  \nThere are ten coalitions across the state, and the language in the Nevada Revised Statutes \n(NRS) did not provide clarity for what their critical role was in the community, so it clarifies \nthat language. \n \nThose are the four things:  certified peer recovery support specialists; make sure we have \nevidence-based programming on substance use disorder in schools; some tweaks to the \nYRBSS survey; and memorializing in statute the role of the substance use coalitions in our \ncommunities.  Again, those are community-based organizations in ten jurisdictions across the \ncounty.  It is a long bill, and the Washoe County Regional Behavioral Health Policy Board \napologizes for being ambitious and putting four things in one bill, but we felt they were all \nworth bringing forward. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 27, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any questions from Committee members?   \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nI am excited for this bill.  I know the work that went into it and the ideas around it are \nfamiliar to me from our board experience.  I have a question about the five-year lookback for \nprofessionals working with children.  I would like to ask about the rationale about a five-year \nlookback rather than a broader period of time.  I think it is pulled from another section, so it \nis a continuation of that policy, but I want to clarify that. \n \nSenator Ratti: \nI am going to ask Joanna Jacob from Clark County to speak to that.  Assemblywoman Peters, \nyou may not recognize that because this evolved during the session and came as a request.  \nIt is very important that we have peers with lived experience working with individuals.  It is \nalso very important that we are protecting children.  This was a request from the county, so \nI will let the county speak to it. \n \nJoanna Jacob, Government Affairs Manager, Clark County: \nIt is true; we worked on this bill with the Washoe County Regional Behavioral Health Policy \nBoard and Senator Ratti.  Assemblywoman Peters, that is pulled from similar provisions in \nlaw right now around the child care and abuse registry—the state registry that we have in \nplace [Statewide Central Registry for the Collection of Information Concerning the Abuse or \nNeglect of a Child].  We modeled these provisions after similar regulations we have for \npeople who work in child care facilities working with small children—licensed child care \nfacilities.  It is a five-year lookback for records in that registry, so it is modeled after similar, \nalready existing protections for people who are working with children on a regular basis.  \nThe reason we did that is the original language of the bill had registration for people having \nto do with elder abuse, and we wanted to incorporate similar protections for child abuse and \nneglect. \n \nI will also point out why Clark County got involved in this.  We believe in this model and it \nhas an application in child welfare, which is something we worked on with Senator Ratti as \nwell, especially with some of the federal laws coming in, so we also wrote in a waiver \nprocess because of the shared experience we have here.  You will see that in section 15.6 \nthere is a waiver process that we will work on with the state and with the child welfare \nagencies because the model is shared and lived experience.  When you are working in a child \nwelfare setting they might have a child abuse or neglect complaint, but that is what makes the \nshared experience more valuable, so we would be able to set a regulatory process to provide \nthat waiver.  That is how we worked with Senator Ratti on that provision. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nThank you.  I appreciate your taking the time to put that on the record for us. \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 27, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nThank you, Senator Ratti, for bringing S.B. 69 (R2) forward.  It sounds like a really good \nprogram, but my question has to do with the peer recovery support specialist.  I know that is \nlived experience, but what type of training would they go through? \n \nSenator Ratti: \nI believe Sean O'Donnell is available to answer that question.  Sean is representing the \nFoundation for Recovery, which the organization that does training for peers to help them \nachieve certification. \n \nSean O'Donnell, Executive Director, Foundation for Recovery: \nThe training that is currently required, and this is pretty standard across the nation, is a \n46-hour  training  typically  delivered  in  person.    It  covers  topics  such  as  ethics  and \nconfidentiality—HIPAA [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act] and 42 CFR \n[Code  of  Federal  Regulations]  Part  2  [confidentiality  of  substance  use  disorder  patient \nrecords].  It also covers how to provide different types of training on tools to use when \nproviding  peer  recovery  support  services  such  as  motivational  interviewing  and  active \nlistening—those types of things—so it is a 46-hour curriculum.  If one seeks certification, \nthere is a state examination you would sit for as well.  Prior to sitting for that examination, in \naddition to completing the 46-hour classroom component, there are 500 hours of practical \nexperience  which  you  can  get  by  volunteering  or  working  for  an  agency  to  get  that \nexperience providing peer support.  Then there is a requirement for an additional 25 hours of \nsupervision where you are being supervised by a peer recovery support specialist supervisor \nwhile you are providing services. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nWould that include the spectrum from children to youth who are involved in drugs? \n \nSenator Ratti: \nIt is a great question, and I think this is a place for some clarity.  There are some youth peer-\nto-peer programs where you have a child who is experiencing substance use disorder and has \nthose  experiences  working  with  another  child  who  may  be  at  risk  of  or  who  is  also \nexperiencing substance use disorder.  Because of liability and any other number of reasons, \nwe would not be certifying people who are under the age of 18 to be health care professionals \nworking in peer recovery support specialist roles.  They are specifically excluded.  A youth-\nto-youth program is a very different thing; however, you could have adult peer recovery \nsupport specialists working in a setting where there are some youth involved.  I will give you \nan example.  In our community we have a family shelter for our homeless services, so there \nis a mix of adults and children there, and a peer recovery support specialist could be working \nin that environment and be working both with the adults in that setting and with the young \npeople in that setting.  I hope that adds some clarity, but we really want to be clear that we \nare not trying to capture the youth peer-to-peer in this.  That is something very different, \nmore like a mentoring program than a professional health care workforce. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 27, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nThere are 25 hours of supervision, and then I missed the rest. \n \nSean O'Donnell: \nThere are 500 hours of practical in-person experience, 25 hours of supervision, and 46 hours \nof classroom learning. \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nSo there are 500 hours and not 15.  That is a big difference.  Thank you for that clarification.  \nIs this based on a national guideline or is this Nevada-specific? \n \nSean O'Donnell: \nIt  is  based  off  national  standards  from  the  International  Certification  &  Reciprocity \nConsortium which handles certification for peer recovery support specialists in almost every \nstate. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI am looking around to see if there are any other questions from Committee members.  \nSeeing none, we will begin testimony in support of S.B. 69 (R2). \n \nJoanna Jacob: \nI just wanted to say that we are in support of this bill and the many amendments Senator Ratti \nworked on with us in the other house.  As I stated before, the reason we got involved in this \nis because of the advent of new federal changes—the Family First Prevention Services Act—\nwe are doing a fundamental shift in foster care as that comes online.  Peer support recovery \nspecialists are an evidence-based practice that we can build into the implementation of that \nact.  It will really focus on moving child welfare into prevention activities, so the shared \nliving model is going to be one we plan to pursue in Clark County, and we want to thank \nSenator Ratti and the whole village of people who worked on this bill.  I also want to say \nthank you to Sean O'Donnell and Ms. Edwards for working with Clark County on this, and \nwe are in support. \n \nJoan Hall, President, Nevada Rural Hospital Partners: \nWe are supportive of all the components of this bill but specifically the peer recovery support \nservices as they are a vital component in providing care to patients and their families with \nsubstance use disorders, behavioral health issues, and co-occurring disorders.  Certification \nprovides public protection in demonstrating training, education, and standardization.  As we \nmove  through  the  Crisis  Now  standard  in  Nevada,  and  we  have  just  passed  the  crisis \nstabilization units, these peer recovery support people will be very important in those units as \nthey are in our MOST [Mobile Outreach Safety Team] teams.  We urge your support. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIs there anyone else who wishes to testify in support of S.B. 69 (R2)?  [There was no one.]  \nAt this time, we will begin opposition testimony of S.B. 69 (R2).  [There was none.]  Next, \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 27, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nwe will go to neutral testimony.  [There was none.]  Senator Ratti, would you like to make \nany closing remarks? \n \nSenator Ratti: \nI would like to point out the fact that this is a two-thirds bill, and the section that makes it \nneed that two-thirds vote is section 9 which establishes the fee for certification and allows the \nboard to establish the fee for certification.  I want to make it very clear that the Washoe board \ndid not ask that the peers be certified.  The peers themselves and the organizations that work \nwith and represent peers came to us and asked.  This will be the third legislative session \nwhere  they  have  tried  to  get  peer  certification  across  the  finish  line.    It  is  the  peer \norganizations themselves that are asking for this certification process. \n \nSean O'Donnell: \nSenator Ratti is correct.  We brought this after listening to the community and holding many \ndifferent platforms for peer recovery support specialists in the state of Nevada to voice their \nopinions on this.  We have been working on this for the last three legislative sessions.  This is \ngoing to do great things for peers and the peer recovery support specialist workforce in our \nstate, so thank you. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe have several new legislative members, so Senator Ratti, could you briefly describe how \nthat regulatory process would work and how the Legislative Commission would approve \nthose regulations as they work their way through the process if this bill were to pass? \n \nSenator Ratti: \nCertainly.  Generally, when we call for regulations in statute, the appropriate regulatory body \npromulgates those regulations.  Once those regulations are promulgated, they have to come \nback to the Legislative Commission—which is rather like the executive committee of the \nLegislature, for lack of a better description.  They meet during the interim and have to sign \noff  on  all  regulations.    It  is  sort  of  a  check-and-balance  situation  to  make  certain  the \nExecutive Branch, which promulgates the regulations, does not get too far afield from the \nLegislature's intent, so it comes back to the Legislative Commission, which signs off on it.  \nThose regulations then become part of the Nevada Administrative Code (NAC).  They are not \nin the NRS, they are in the NAC, which still has the full force of law.  \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you, Senator Ratti, and thank you for your presentation of S.B. 69 (R2).  At this time, \nI  will  close  the  hearing  on  S.B.  69  (R2)  and  open  the  hearing  on  Senate  Bill  211 \n(2nd Reprint). \n  \nSenate Bill 211 (2nd Reprint):  Establishes requirements relating to testing for sexually \ntransmitted diseases. (BDR 40-563) \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 27, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nSenator Dallas Harris, Senate District No. 11: \nThank you for the opportunity to present Senate Bill 211 (2nd Reprint) to you today.  In the \nsimplest of terms, S.B. 211 (R2) requires primary care providers to ask their patients aged 15 \nand  older  if  they  would  like  a  test  for  a  sexually  transmitted  disease  or  HIV.    That \nrecommendation  about  which  one  a  person  should  be  tested  for  should  be  based  upon \nmedical history.  There is no requirement here that you get tested for everything under the \nsun,  but  if  the  coronavirus  has  taught  us  anything,  knowing  your  status  is  key.  \nUnfortunately, the state of Nevada has unbelievably high rates of syphilis and other sexually \ntransmitted  diseases  (STDs).    This  recommendation  comes  from  the  CDC  [Centers  for \nDisease Control and Prevention].  It is best medical practice and we are putting it into law as \na tool to try and address some of those rates. \n \nMs. Cheryl Radeloff has a wonderful presentation [Exhibit C] available to you all that is \nposted on the Nevada Electronic Legislative Information System (NELIS).  She is here today \nto answer questions unless, Chair Nguyen, you would like her to walk through all the details. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIf she would like to do a high-level overview, that would be good for the record.  Most of our \nCommittee members were provided with this information last week. \n \nCheryl Radeloff, Ph.D., Senior Health Educator, Southern Nevada Health District: \nAs was mentioned, Nevada consistently has had some of the highest rates of HIV and STDs \nor  sexually  transmitted  infections  (STIs)  in  the  United  States  [page  2,  Exhibit  C].   \nAs of 2019, we were number one in the nation for rates of primary and secondary syphilis.  \nWe had over 800 cases.  We were also number four in congenital syphilis.  In 2019, we went \nto number four from being number two in 2018.  We are ranked number 17 for rates of \nchlamydia [page 16] and number 15 for rates of gonorrhea [page 18].  To give you an idea \nfor congenital syphilis, I just gave a presentation to some UNLV [University of Nevada, \nLas Vegas] School of Nursing students.  From 2014 to 2020 we increased 1,300 percent in \ncongenital syphilis.  We went from 3 cases in 2014 to 43 cases in 2019.   \n \nThe majority of HIV cases in Nevada are diagnosed in inpatient and outpatient hospitals and \nprivate physician offices.  Patients with a diagnosis of STIs are similar to HIV.  Patients do \nwant their routine sexual histories, access to pain-free, low-cost, confidential and convenient \ntesting for HIV and STIs [unintelligible].  Providers are only providing testing based on \n[unintelligible] so it is dependent on patients to report presenting symptoms.  There is a lack \nof [unintelligible] STI testing, a lack of awareness of HIV and STI [unintelligible].  \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI am going to ask you to stop.  Unfortunately, we have a really poor quality of audio.  We are \nhearing every third word.  Senator Harris, would you mind if we went to you?  I know the \nbill is not very long and that a lot of the information just spoken to is in the exhibits which \nare on NELIS [Exhibit C and Exhibit D].  Would you be ready for questions at this time or \nare there things you would like to highlight? \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 27, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nSenator Harris: \nIn summation, the numbers Cheryl Radeloff mentioned are not good.  This bill is a tool to \nhelp us get those numbers down.  One thing she said that was important but difficult to hear \nis that often right now, this is not a routine part of primary care.  We rely on patients to \npresent symptoms, as opposed to getting them tested as part of their regular primary care.  An \nimportant piece to that is reducing the stigma behind HIV and STDs.  We would like to \nnormalize the idea that you should get tested as part of your regular medical care, and that is \nwhat the bill does, in the hope of addressing a very serious issue.  Ms. Radeloff, thank you so \nmuch.  She put together that presentation, your exhibit, along with Jennifer Howell, and she \nhas also done a lot of great work on this bill. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you.  I know sometimes we have technical difficulties, and I am glad we have the \nSenator here to clarify any concerns.  I encourage all Committee members to look at the \ndocuments that were on NELIS, as I am sure you already have.  Do we have any questions? \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank you, Senator, for bringing this bill.  I think this is a good bill, and I am as appalled as \nyou are when we find out Nevada is number one in congenital syphilis and in some of these \nother issues.  I think it is important.  There have been many changes in health care.  When \nI would do the recommended pelvic exam and Pap test on a young woman for the first time \nprior to prescribing birth control, we would do some of these tests—although not necessarily \nfor HIV.  That was just part of the process.  Now we have learned that we do not do routine \npelvic exams, so we are not doing these tests routinely anymore.  When you have that patient \nin front of you, you would hate to miss an opportunity.  My question is, This is mandating \ncertain things a provider should be doing, but where is the information about payment?  Who \npays for these tests?  I am concerned that the providers are being mandated to ask if the \npatient wants to have a test done, but there are always concerns about the costs of these tests.  \nSome of these are blood tests, others are not; so I am wondering about that process. \n \nSenator Harris: \nThe bill does not mandate that the testing occur; it only mandates that you ask.  What you \nwill see, and the reason the bill is coming to you so late, is that we got an appropriation for \nthose folks whose tests are covered by our Medicaid.  That is the state cost.  Otherwise, this \nbill would operate in the same way it would today if you asked your doctor for a test.  Your \ninsurance would cover it or, if you had Medicaid, they would cover it.  Nothing would \nchange.  The bill is just about requiring a provider to ask. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIs this something practitioners are already asking?  Is this a problem? \n \nSenator Harris: \nI am not here to disparage any providers.  There are some who do it as a regular course of \npractice.  I think it is more common for the STDs than it is for the HIV, but we have a fairly \nsignificant HIV transmission issue here in the state as well, so I am trying to make sure that \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 27, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \npractice is also normalized.  I can say that it is best practice to talk to your patients about \ngetting tested.  It is my hope that we will bring in some more doctors who are doing it \nregularly.  One thing that is new in this bill is that it does speak to emergency care providers.   \nAs this Committee knows, there are some people who get their primary care through the \nemergency room, so I anticipate we will see a lot of growth in that arena.   \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nI was curious about the cutoff at age 15.  As I look at the presentation from Ms. Radeloff and \nMs. Howell, it says the CDC recommends HIV testing starting at age 13. \n \nSenator Harris: \nPlease note that the 15-year cutoff is when the provider \"shall\" ask.  I would encourage them \nto ask any of their clients who they feel may especially be at risk for HIV or who may be \nsexually active, at any age.  The bill does not prevent providers from asking anyone younger \nthan 15, but that is the age we came to when trying to put this bill together—about when it \nshould become a regular practice. \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nThank you for bringing this.  I think it is really important because so many people have a \nsexually transmitted disease and do not even realize it because they do not have symptoms.  \nNow that it is going to be mandated, what happens if a doctor is not asking? \n \nSenator Harris: \nI thought a lot about that.  Originally in this Nevada Revised Statutes chapter there is a \nmisdemeanor for anyone who does not comply with the chapter.  I was not looking to create \na new misdemeanor, so this bill will be enforced by the licensing boards of the providers.  \nThere is no criminal penalty attached at all.  That will have to be dealt with by the proper \nlicensing board, as I think it should. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nThis is a good bill.  We absolutely need to make sure people are getting tested.  Practicably, \nas you would want this to look, you would want the primary care physician to be asking.  \nHowever, if someone saw his or her primary care physician three times within the year, if the \nphysician sees in the chart that there is a recent test, would that physician acknowledge the \ntest or talk with the patient about the test and whether the patient wanted to be retested?  \nAlternatively, if the physician looked at the patient's chart and saw there had been no recent \ntesting,  would  the  physician  ask  about  testing?    For  multiple  visits,  what  would  be  a \nreasonable expectation? \n \nSenator Harris: \nThat  would  likely  vary  depending  upon  possibly  how  sexually  active  a  client  is.    My \nestimation is that once a year is more than sufficient to make this a regular practice.  What \nI want to make sure does not happen is that someone goes for a substantial amount of time \nwithout being asked for a test.  If they are asked three times in a year, that would also be \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 27, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \ngreat if that is what they choose to do.  However, that is a discussion they will have with their \ndoctor—how often is appropriate? \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI think once a year is good, especially when people have chronic health conditions or such.  \nThere are lots of chart audits, so the intent would be, was the question asked once a year?  \nHopefully there is testing once a year, but somewhere there should be a notation in a patient \nchart that the question has been asked.   \n \nSenator Harris: \nI think that is correct.   \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nI had a similar question about the mechanism—the way the question is asked.  Does it have \nto be verbal—because I do not see that in the bill—or can it be in the paperwork?  There \ncould be a line item reading, \"Would you like to be tested for STDs or HIV?\" and have it be \njust a regular thing that happens in the initial paperwork as a patient comes into the office.  \nThat way you do not have doctors asking every time, creating an uncomfortable situation \nwhen a person is just in an office for, say, removal of stitches.  Would that be a possibility \nunder this bill? \n \nSenator Harris: \nAbsolutely, it is.  I did not want to be overly prescriptive or require a verbal question each \ntime.  There are a lot of ways that doctors today comply with notice requirements to their \npatients, and there is plenty of flexibility for that in this bill. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nFifteen:  that is a minor, and often that child would be going to a pediatrician for an annual \nexam.  What kind of discussion have you had around that fact?  I do not know about anyone \nelse, but I have three sons, and I accompanied them and stayed in the room for all their \nexams.  Have you thought about how you will manage that? \n \nSenator Harris: \nThat is always a really tough issue.  I know doctors have plenty of experience figuring out \nwhen would be the right time to allow a parent in or when they may need to ask a parent to \nleave in order to deal with their patient and possibly get honest answers to some of these \nsensitive issues.  I imagine this will be a discussion between a doctor and the patient and in \nappropriate circumstances based upon the child's age and the parent as well. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any other questions from Committee members at this time?  Seeing none, I will \nbegin testimony in support of S.B. 211 (R2). \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 27, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nBradley Mayer, representing Southern Nevada Health District and Washoe County \nHealth District: \nThis is an important bill because Nevada has some of the highest STI rates in the country \nand, especially as it relates to HIV, the highest infection rate in the West.  We know that in \norder to stop the spread of HIV, people need to know their status.  In recent years, almost \n40 percent of new transmissions came from those who did not know they had HIV.  If we can \nidentify  those  cases  and  get  people  into  treatment  more  quickly,  get  their  viral  loads \nsuppressed,  then  they  will  not  be  transmitting  at  the  same  rate.    So  this  bill,  as  was \nmentioned, and similar legislation moving along such as Assembly Bill 192 which deals with \nsyphilis testing, are really important to making sure we are staying ahead of this.  Making \nthis part of the standard of care is what is most important.   We thank Senator Harris for her \nwork this session.  We really appreciate her for engaging with us and urge your support. \n \nAllison Genco, representing Dignity Health-St. Rose Dominican: \nWe are here in support of S.B. 211 (R2) and want to thank Senator Harris for her work \non this bill. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIs there anyone else in support? \n \nAlex Camberos, representing Battle Born Progress: \nWe are in support of S.B. 211 (R2).  Creating a standard of care for routine, confidential, and \nconvenient STI testing will destigmatize sexual health and reduce the spread of STIs and \nHIV by promoting access to testing and treatment.  I want to echo the comments of the others \nin support, and I want to thank Senator Harris for bringing this critical legislation.  We ask \nthe members of the Committee for their support as well. \n \nAlyssa Cortes, representing Silver State Equality: \nI would like to thank Senator Dallas Harris for bringing this really important legislation up \nfor a hearing.  We are very supportive of S.B. 211 (R2) and I represent Silver State Equality \nas a program associate.  Thank you so much. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any other callers on the line in support?  [There were none.]  Is there anyone in \nopposition to S.B. 211 (R2)?  [There was no one.]  Is there anyone who would like to testify \nin neutral to S.B. 211 (R2)?  I see Ms. Erin Lynch, from the Division of Health Care \nFinancing and Policy [Department of Health and Human Services] on Zoom, but she is \nunable to unmute.  I believe Ms. Lynch is neutral, is that correct?  [She nodded yes.]  Is there \nanyone else who wishes to testify in neutral?  [There was no one.]  Senator Harris, do you \nhave any closing remarks? \n \nSenator Harris: \nI want to thank the Committee for your time and thoughtful questions today as well as \nthanking Ms. Radeloff and Ms. Howell, who have been instrumental in helping me draft this \nlegislation. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 27, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAt this time, I will close the hearing on Senate Bill 211 (2nd Reprint) and open the hearing \non Senate Bill 456. \n \nSenate  Bill  456:    Revises  provisions  relating  to  the  State  Dental  Health  Officer. \n(BDR 40-1159) \n \nSuzanne  Bierman,  Administrator,  Division  of  Health  Care  Financing  and  Policy, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services: \nI am here today to present Senate Bill 456.  The Division's budget included a transfer of \nappointing authority for the State Dental Health Officer from the Division of Public and \nBehavioral Health (DPBH), Department of Health and Human Services, to Medicaid.  This \nbill implements the Division's budget.  Transferring this position results in State General \nFund savings because the Division can receive a greater federal share of 75 percent for \nfunding of this position with the transfer as approved in our budget. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDoes anyone have questions regarding the bill? \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nI am curious about the move of the State Dental Health Officer and the state dental hygienist.  \nIf they are not under the same division umbrella, can you explain why that difference \nis okay? \n \nCody Phinney, Deputy Administrator, Division of Health Care Financing and Policy, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services: \nThe oral health program was started in the Division of Public and Behavioral Health several \nyears ago.  The State Public Health Dental Hygienist and the State Program for Oral Health \nwill remain at DPBH, while Dr. Antonina Capurro, the current incumbent State Dental \nHealth Officer, will come over and continue working on Medicaid policy with us officially \nand in the budget.  The collaboration with the Oral Health Program and the state dental \nhygienist will continue within the overarching umbrella of the Department of Health and \nHuman Services.  From our perspective, it is not an enormous difference, but it allows us to \ncollect that additional federal participation. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any other questions from Committee members?   \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nIs Ms. Capurro the hygienist? \n \nCody Phinney: \nNo, Dr. Capurro is the State Dental Health Officer.

CANNIZZARO (Senatorial District No. 6): \nI  will  read  from  my  written  presentation  on  S.B.  420  (Exhibit  B)  and  have \nsubmitted a conceptual amendment (Exhibit C). \n \nKATIE KEITH, J.D., M.P.H. (Associate Research Professor and Adjunct Professor \nof Law, Georgetown University): \nI  am  speaking  on  S.B.  420  regarding  additional  health  insurance  coverage \nexpansion in Nevada. I have submitted my written presentation (Exhibit D) and \nsupplemental documents (Exhibit E). \n \nSHENAKWA HAWKINS (Care With Purpose Medical Center, LLC): \nI am in favor of S.B. 420 and will explain why this bill is needed. I am a health \ncare  provider,  small  business  owner  and  advanced  practice  registered  nurse \n(APRN). I run the Care With Purpose Medical Center in Las Vegas. We serve \ncommunities of color and low-income communities including a large homeless \npopulation.  I  know  what  it  is  like  to  lose  your  job  along  with  your  health \ninsurance. I lost mine at the start of this pandemic when the clinic I worked for \nshut its doors. Our practice at Care With Purpose Medical Center treats many \npeople who are in the same situation I was in. I have been a nurse for over \n20 years, including in emergency rooms and trauma centers. If people had been \nable to afford health insurance and were treated proactively, they could have \navoided  expensive  emergency  care.  I  see  this  far  too  much,  and  it  is \nheartbreaking and frustrating. Anything we can do to make health insurance \naccessible and affordable will help many people and  S.B. 420 will do just that.  \n \nAs an APRN, the pay parity provision of the bill will allow me to keep my clinic \nopen. There is so much healthcare inequality in our existing system, and that is \npart of what inspired me to open the practice and help historically underserved \npopulations. We are providing the same level of care with preventive medicine \nand management of chronic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes and high \ncholesterol, which are dominant medical conditions in communities of color. \n \nCost of insurance is a major factor. This bill will help bring costs down and help \ncommunities like the ones I serve in my clinic. I ask this Committee to help us \nand pass S.B. 420. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nRANDI LAMPERT, M.D.: \nI  am  a  pediatrician  practicing  in  Las  Vegas,  and  I  support  a  Nevada  Public \nOption.  I  have  seen  too  many  people  go  without  health  care  or  medical \ntreatment. My written testimony has been submitted (Exhibit F). \n \nSENATOR CANNIZZARO: \nThis bill is personal to me. While I was in college, I injured myself badly after \nlosing my health insurance. Because I did not have access to health care, the \nmedical  bills  followed  me  after  law  school  as  I  was  seeking  to  become  an \nattorney, and it took years to pay the medical bills.  \n \nI cannot imagine what it must be like to wonder if your baby is okay, or the \nperson carrying your child is going to be okay. Doing nothing is not a solution. \nSenate Bill 420 will help get us there. I will now read from my written remarks, \nExhibit B, with a summary of the Public Option. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWill the Public Option be open to anyone living in Nevada? What waivers to the \nrules as part of the State Innovation Waiver in section 11 will you be requesting \nto obtain federal financial support for the Public Option? \n \nSENATOR CANNIZZARO: \nThe Public Option would not be available to individuals who are covered under \ntheir employer-paid health plans, especially large employers from multiemployer \nhealth plans. We are talking about the individual and small-group market, and \nthat is what this product is designed to capture. \n \nWe will work with the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to \nlook at what waivers are available. We have also looked at the Affordable Care \nAct  (ACA)  1332  waiver.  We  want  to  make  sure  there  is  enough  built-in \nflexibility and innovative capacity to get funds to help buy down the costs of \npremiums. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nSixty-five percent of individuals in our State are eligible for Medicaid or subsidy \neligible under the ACA. A substantial portion of the rest of that population are \nundocumented individuals and not eligible for subsidy under the Silver State \nHealth Insurance Exchange. Who are we targeting or bringing into this market? \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nAre we going to disrupt the  small-group market  so massively that it brings \npeople in? I am trying to understand who is going to sign up. \n \nSENATOR CANNIZZARO: \nThere are many individuals who are uninsured and do not qualify for subsidies, \nand affordability is a barrier with respect to the Exchange. \n \nSTACIE WEEKS (Aurrera Health Group): \nOut of 350,000 individuals in the small-group category, 37 percent are eligible \nfor Medicaid but have not yet enrolled. Affordability challenges today in the \nExchange are experienced by 17 percent. The Public Option would be available \nto those individuals, and if they are eligible for the Exchange, could purchase \nthe  product.  Immigration  status  is  a  barrier  for  27  percent  of  individuals; \nhowever, it is not always the undocumented individuals. It could be individuals \neligible for Medicaid who are barred by the five-year residency rule. If individuals \nhave not lived in the U.S. for five years, they cannot purchase Medicaid. Many \nimmigrants struggle with this barrier because they are low-income when they \nfirst  move  to  the  U.S.  This  product  would  be  available  to  that  27  percent \noutside the Exchange. This product would also be available to the 19 percent \nwho are eligible for Nevada Health Link but are not enrolled. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nFor the 17 percent who have affordability challenges, there was a significant \nexpansion of tax credit subsidy and support through the American Recovery \nPlan, including increases beyond 400 percent of the federal poverty level. Does \nthat address some of the 17 percent? \n \nMS. WEEKS: \nThat subsidy amount is temporary and would not be long-term to address the \nissue. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWill  this  work,  and  is  this  going  to  be  revenue  neutral  by  using  other \npractitioners such as doulas? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe will have general discussions about the cost and then a deeper conversation \nwith the Senate Committee on Finance. We have a fiscal note posted. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nSENATOR CANNIZZARO: \nThe  Public  Option  is  separate  from  Medicaid  eligibility.  The  overall  goal  of \nS.B. 420 is to help increase access to affordable care. We have been talking \nwith  DHHS  and  the  Exchange  with  respect  to  pregnant  women  in  those \npopulations  and  some  of  the  surrounding  prenatal  and  postpartum  care.  In \nS.B. 420, there is the inclusion of eligibility for some of these services, which \nwould not be revenue neutral. There is a fiscal note associated with it and there \nare  federal  funds  that  would  accompany  those  as  with  many  Medicaid  and \nfederal matching dollars. The waivers and Public Option Trust Fund is about \nhealth insurance as a whole. Some of the Medicaid pieces would cost the State \nmoney, which we will discuss with the Senate Committee on Finance. Overall, \nbringing in federal dollars will help with savings in terms of more acute care for \nthose patients. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nHow are we motivating insurance companies or hospitals to cut their costs \nwhen the reality to provide coverage will increase from 5 percent to 15 percent \nin 4 or 5 years? \n \nSENATOR CANNIZZARO: \nIndividuals looking at the Public Option are uninsured and uncompensated at this \npoint. When hospitals or providers see those individuals, they are providing that \ncare for the uninsured. Those built-in costs are distributed among other people \nwho are paying for health insurance. The Public Option is a premium-based plan. \nOur goal with this is to create something that is more affordable so people can \nactually afford it. People may be eligible to get health care, but if they cannot \nafford  it  that  eligibility  is  meaningless.  When  individuals  are  covered,  even \nthough it may be a lower-cost plan, that is something that is far more than what \nhospitals  and  providers  would  be  getting  for  individuals  who  are  on \nuncompensated care. The motivation is to get more people insured so you are \nnot  facing  the  prospect  of  them  coming  in  for  medical  services  and  being \ncompletely uninsured. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nThis is a great bill, and I am happy to see it here in Nevada. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAccess to insurance does not always equal access to care. It depends on how \nskinny that network might be and the provider list, and whether that provider \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nlist has waitlists, or depending on the number of available providers, or if we \nhave the specialists we need in the network. How does the bill approach the \nquestion  of  network  adequacy  making  sure  that  just  because  you  have \ninsurance also means you have care? \n \nSENATOR CANNIZZARO: \nIf someone is eligible for insurance and cannot afford it, that is akin to being \nineligible for insurance. Similarly, if someone is on a plan that either does not \nprovide the basic level services he or she needs or, the individual does not have \naccess  to  see  a  provider,  then  that  is  akin  to  having  no  care  at  all. \nSenate Bill 420 has a couple of things in it that address that issue. We are \nrequiring groups bidding on those contacts to also bid on the Public Option to \nmake a good-faith bid for that product. If you take Medicaid patients, you are \nalso accepting the Public Option. This is similar to workers’ compensation and \nthe Public Employees’ Benefit Plan. We are creating a network of providers \nStatewide  that  will  see  these  patients  and  will  accept  that  insurance  to \nhopefully address the adequacy of care issue. We are also talking about this \nbeing a Statewide product where you will see the continuity of care even if \npeople were to move, or if they were unqualified individuals or did not have \nemployer-based health care, that they could also have that flexibility to stay \nwith their providers and make sure they could continue having that access with \nthis particular product. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIf I understand the bill correctly, the insurance companies are required to bid on \nthe Public Option if they want to bid on Medicaid. Do providers who accept \nMedicare or Medicaid also have to accept the Public Option? \n \nSENATOR CANNIZZARO: \nThat is correct. It also includes workers’ compensation, in particular, the State \nworkers’ compensation and Public Employees’ Benefit Plan (PEBP). \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSo we have had some challenges with providers choosing to opt out of our \nMedicare  and  Medicaid  systems  because  of  the  rates.  Do  we  have  any \nexperience with similar models in other states? Are we concerned about the \npotentially unintended consequence of losing providers who choose to get out \nof the whole public space? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nSENATOR CANNIZZARO: \nThis bill will ensure there are providers who will accept the Public Option so \npeople can get access to services. The populations sought to be served with the \nPublic Option are individuals who are not insured because they do not qualify, or \nthey are not insured because they are having affordability issues, either through \ntheir small-group employers that are not providing insurance or because these \nindividuals simply cannot afford what is offered. \n \nWe are not increasing eligibility for Medicaid rates and demanding those eligible \nare covered at the Medicaid rate. Individuals will choose an insurance plan and \npay the premiums based on the rate. Our goal is to provide a Public Option with \nnegotiated  rates  that  would  incentivize  providers  to  accept  clients  that  are \nunderinsured and provide them with coverage paid for through the system.  \n \nWe have not seen other states that have implemented this type of model. One \nof the important key aspects about this bill is there is built-in time to allow \nDHHS to help implement the Public Option. There is also time to consult with \nthe Exchange and insurance commissioner to ensure we are getting those price \npoints  correct  and  making  the  right  decisions  on  how  this  would  be \nimplemented. Additionally, we are going to take time to look at the data and \nmake sure what we are doing does not inadvertently price out other providers or \nresult in a loss of providers. The goal is to ensure there are individuals who \nwould be accepting the Public Option and create a network of providers. \n \nMS. WEEKS: \nMinnesota has a similar provision for its Medicaid program, public employee \nprogram and workers’ compensation. It is called Rule 101 in Minnesota, and it \nworks well there. There are robust networks of providers in Minnesota because \nof that rule. Since you are tying it to Medicaid in many ways and doing a \nprocurement together, you are going to be incentivizing plans if providers want \nto offer the product and obtain the money Medicaid can bring as well as this \nmarket. We know the contracts to managed care are close to $2 billion. If \ninsurance  companies  want  that,  it  would  incentivize  them  to  do  better  by \nproviders to make sure they are in their networks to offer and incentivize those \nplans to come forward, and work with providers in a way that maybe they are \nnot today. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nPlease walk me through the timeline. I want to make sure it is clear on the \npublic record that this is not effective July 1, for people would think they have \naccess to insurance in the next year. \n \nSENATOR CANNIZZARO: \nIn  the  proposed  conceptual  amendment,  Exhibit  C,  on  page  2,  item  9,  we \nrevised it to be available for the coverage year beginning January 1, 2026 to \nallow  for  alignment  of  procurement.  This  is  not  something  that  would  be \nimplemented July 1. Our goal is to build in that lead time so there is enough \nspace for DHHS in consultation to provide for that procurement—also, time for \nus to get the data in the interim through actuarial studies to ensure we are \nputting it in a good spot. By building in that time and allowing this to become a \nplan year effective in 2026, it allows the flexibility that is needed. It is also \nencouraging creativity on our part, as a State, to come up with a way in which \nto implement this, resulting in savings to Nevadans. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe bill recognizes this could be a problem due to the fact we are going to allow \nPEBP and Medicaid to opt out of that requirement. We are saying in section 13, \nsubsection 2 of the bill, that if we are going to disrupt access for our people \nthrough Medicaid and PEBP, or if they are going to have difficult access to \ncovered services, we are going to allow them to waive this requirement for \ncommensurate access. \n \nIn section 10, is it stating there have to be at least two plans, a gold and a \nsilver option offered? \n \nSENATOR CANNIZZARO: \nYes, there would be a gold plan and silver plan. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nHow  should  section  10,  subsection  5,  as  amended  in  your  conceptual \namendment, Exhibit C, regarding costs, be interpreted? Is it that over four years \nthe costs of these plans will be 15 percent less or the average costs of all \nhealth insurance plans will be 15 percent less? \n \nSENATOR CANNIZZARO: \nThis is applicable to the Public Option only, not to plans across the State. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe targeted price reduction of health insurance is not a downward pressure on \nall plans in the State to try to reduce premiums. It is specific solely to these \ntwo Public Options. Is this correct? \n \nSENATOR CANNIZZARO: \nYes. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIn the amendment, Exhibit C, bullet point 6 as it relates to the Culinary Workers \nUnion Health Fund, is the idea it would be subsidy eligible if it is offered on the \nExchange. Would it be able to enroll people who are not members of the group? \nIf an association health plan would fit this category, could it enroll people who \nare not part of the association? \n \nSENATOR CANNIZZARO: \nThis is not specific to any particular group. We have many multiemployer plans \nin our State. Individuals may find themselves in a situation where they have lost \ntheir healthcare coverage because of loss of employment for a period of time. \nThe goal is, with approval from the federal government for different waivers and \nsubsidies the individuals might apply for, this is going to allow a structure in \ncollaboration with DHHS to make sure these groups could continue coverage for \nthe individuals who would otherwise have fallen off the group plans. The goal is \nto create continuity of care and ensure people can keep their health insurance \neven though they may have periods where they would not otherwise remain. \nPart of this is allowing flexibility and working with DHHS to create options and \nhaving approval with respect to waivers through the federal government. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIt is not open to the general public; would it only be people as part of the \nqualified group? \n \nSENATOR CANNIZZARO: \nOur intention is to make sure individuals who would still be qualified under that \nqualified  group.  If  there  were  an  indication  it  would  be  feasible  to  include \nindividuals such as family members that potentially would have fallen off or \nwould not be covered, they could potentially be covered. It is not as prescriptive \nas that in the language and how we are envisioning it. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe  have  the  intent  of  the  bill  on  the  record  but  would  like  our  Counsel, \nEric Robbins, to address the 15 percent for clarification. \n \nERIC ROBBINS (Counsel): \nThe  bill  provides  the  Director  of  DHHS  may  revise  the  performance  targets \nprovided the Public Option remains on target to reduce average premiums for \nhealth  insurance  in  the  State  by  at  least  15  percent  over  4  years  in  the \nconceptual amendment, Exhibit C, in which the Public Option is in operation. \nThe text of the bill would go along with Senator Kieckhefer's initial impression \nthat it would have to create downward pressure on all of the health insurance in \nthe State and lower the average premiums of all health insurance by at least \n15 percent. If it is going to carry out the intent expressed on the record today, \nthe bill would need to be amended to reflect that intent. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nJust because we say a health insurance plan needs to have premiums that are \n15 percent less, that does not reduce costs by 15 percent. It may actually \nincrease costs and utilization, and there are a lot of different factors that could \nhappen downstream. Who is going to pick up that cost? \n \nSENATOR CANNIZZARO: \nWe are talking about getting individuals who cannot afford or are ineligible for \nhealth insurance. There are costs for uninsured, uncompensated care. It is more \nexpensive  to  cover  individuals  through  emergency  services  for  more  acute \nconditions, more often than not, or where a condition has gone untreated for a \nsignificant period of time. The treatment and mitigation of whatever the disease \nare  far  more  expensive,  intrusive  and  difficult  to  deal  with  and  are  not \ncompensated. We are not talking about instances where individuals have health \ninsurance and emergency services are what they are utilizing. We are talking \nabout individuals who have much higher costs getting them insured so they \nhave access to regular health care which, overall, will reduce their utilization of \nthose emergency acute services. Also, there is compensation where there was \nnone. Yes, there are costs associated with that, and we are trying to make it \nmore affordable, but the other alternative is these individuals go without health \ninsurance. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nPhilosophically, I do not know if that is where we are going to be getting people \nfrom. If we are opening up the small-group market, I am concerned it is going to \npoach more people out of that than some of the categories we are talking \nabout, like the 37 percent who are Medicaid eligible and go into a hospital with \na significant problem. Those hospitals do everything they can to make sure the \nindividuals are eligible or enrolled. If we make a plan 5 percent more affordable \nthan the second lowest silver plan, but people have made the choice not to \nenroll even though they are eligible on the Exchange now, I am not convinced \nthat will trigger them to sign up. I am concerned about where the cost shifts are \ngoing to happen to make up for some of this artificial pressure, and I think it is \ninto large-group insurance, employer-based insurance and downward pressure \non providers. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIn my experience when the ACA became effective, for instance, seeing patients \nwho saved up all their illnesses and instead of one or two problems, we were \ndealing with five different diseases all at once. This same kind of thing is going \nto happen, so there would be an initial, quite expensive problem you would be \nfacing. At the same time, that is the individual practitioner as opposed to the \nhospitals. In speaking with hospitals over the years, they do not make money on \nMedicaid or Medicare; they make up the difference on private insurance. What \nis it going to amount to for the practitioners in hospitals, hospitals themselves \nor  the  insurance  companies  that  have  done  many  things  to  invest  in  the \ncommunity? That is one of the challenges we are going to see, the investment \nin the community while they are trying to push down to that 5 percent and \neventually 15 percent. \n \nANNETTE MAGNUS-MARQUART (Battle Born Progress): \nWe support S.B. 420. My written remarks have been submitted (Exhibit G). \n \nDAVID GOLDWATER: \nI support S.B. 420. I am representing myself and the small business for whom I \nwork.  I  have  worked  around  health  policy  for  almost  30  years.  I  have  a \ndisclaimer in that access to affordable health care is the right of all Nevadans. \nI am a partner in a small retail business that employs 35 people and also have a \nsmall consulting firm that employs 3 people. We pay for health insurance for our \nemployees. If the Legislative building were open to the public, the line for small \nbusiness owners would be out the door in support of this bill because health \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \ninsurance costs are such a big part of our budgets. Probably 10 to 15 percent of \nour health insurance cost represents 20 to 30 percent of total compensation to \nour employees.  \n \nWe have an employer-based insurance program, and that is how we deliver \nhealth insurance, through our employer. That was not my choice nor anyone \nelse's, but that is the one we have. Providers should be paid for their services. \nThose costs should be fair and not shifted between the insured and uninsured. \nThe  incentives  for  care  should  be  aligned.  The  employer-based  system, \nhowever, is particularly hard on small businesses. That is where the gaps are \nand where this bill fills those gaps. Small businesses do not have easy access to \ncapital markets and therefore are generally undercapitalized. Additionally, most \nsmall businesses are the  primary source of income.  The  dollars we pay for \nhealth insurance for our employees is felt by the owners. Those monies would \notherwise go to our families and provide for our own well-being.  \n \nPRISCILLA  MALONEY  (American  Federation  of  State,  County  and  Municipal \nEmployees, Retirees Nevada Chapter 4041): \nWe support S.B. 420. My written remarks have been submitted (Exhibit H). \n \nSARAH ADLER (Nevada Advanced Practice Nurses Association):  \nWe  support  S.B.  420.  My  written  remarks  (Exhibit  I)  and  our  proposed \namendment to S.B. 420, section 30 (Exhibit J) have been submitted. \n \nERIC JENG (One APIA Nevada; Asian Community Development Council): \nWe support S.B. 420. My written remarks have been submitted (Exhibit K) as \nwell as a letter of support signed by many Asian Pacific Islander American small \nbusiness owners (Exhibit L). \n \nCHRISTINE SAUNDERS (Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada): \nWe support S.B. 420. My written remarks have been submitted (Exhibit M). \n \nQUENTIN SAVWOIR (Make It Work Nevada): \nWe support S.B. 420. My written remarks have been submitted (Exhibit N). \n \nBARRY GOLD (AARP): \nWe support S.B. 420. My written remarks from AARP (Exhibit O) have been \nsubmitted. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nKATIE ROBBINS (Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada): \nWe support S.B. 420. Nevada has one of the highest uninsured populations in \nthe Nation, and the Public Option will provide higher quality, lower cost care to \npeople across the State. The Public Option will also help address the disparities \npeople of color face when trying to find affordable quality care for themselves \nand their families. Increasing access to health care, including reproductive health \ncare, will make our State stronger and more equitable. \n \nJIM SULLIVAN (Culinary Workers Union Local 226): \nWe  support  S.B.  420.  We  support  the  bill  and  conceptual  amendment, \nExhibit C, because health care is a human right. This is a good first step toward \nmaking sure all Nevadans get quality and affordable health care. Nevada has \none of the highest uninsured rates in the Country, which this bill addresses by \ncreating a Public Option for working families who are either not eligible for \nhealthcare plans or cannot afford it. In addition, the conceptual amendment, \nExhibit C, to this bill would allow the Culinary Workers Union Health Fund to \nparticipate in the program and continue to take care of participants if they were \nto  lose  healthcare  benefits.  This  is  important  because  it  would  allow  union \nmembers and their dependents to continue to see their same doctors, not create \na gap in much needed treatments, and have access to the same prescriptions \nand specialists instead of having to start over with a brand-new insurer if they \nwere to lose coverage. \n \nEVAN LOUIE: \nI support S.B. 420. It makes sense to have insurance providers compete with \nthe  Public  Option  which  will  in  turn  provide  lower  premiums  and  expanded \ncoverage. Nevada is forty-eighth in the Nation for overall health care and has \nthe highest uninsured rate of the Medicaid expansion states. \n \nAs a personal story, my late wife was diagnosed with brain cancer four months \nafter  we  were  married  and  seven  and  one-half  months  pregnant  with  our \ndaughter. I stopped running my business and lived in the hospital taking care of \nmy wife and prematurely-born daughter. We could barely survive keeping up \nwith COBRA premiums and healthcare costs because of severe income loss and \ncost of living. After my wife's passing, affordable health care is something for \nwhich I have become extremely passionate. As a small business owner, I know \nthat  competition  drives  innovation,  but  having  more  options  is  better  for \neveryone. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nDANIEL CORONA (Mayor, West Wendover): \nWe support S.B. 420. In the summer of 2017, it was announced Nevada's \n14 most rural counties would have no insurance options due to the Exchange. \nThousands of Nevadans, including myself, would not receive health insurance \non the Exchange and simply be out of luck. Thankfully, at the last minute, State \nleaders  were  able  to  avert  a  disaster  and  secure  health  insurance  for  rural \nNevadans. The threat of no available health insurance through the Exchange still \nlooms yearly for rural Nevadans. However, there is potential for a long-term \nsolution  through  S.B.  420.  If  passed,  it  would  be  one  of  the  most \ncomprehensive and robust public health insurance plans in the Country. For the \nfirst time ever, Nevadans in rural areas of our State would be guaranteed access \nto affordable coverage through a Statewide Public Option.  This means rural \nproviders  and  hospitals  will  also  be  guaranteed  reimbursement  for  patients \nenrolled in the Public Option. This would be a game changer. \n \nRural  hospitals  provided  nearly  $30  million  in  uncompensated  care  in \n2020 alone. Meeting those costs has been crushing Nevada's rural hospitals \nand is a major factor in why so many have recently closed their doors. This bill \nwould also provide rural Nevadans with a Statewide network of doctors. They \ncould receive in-network care even if those providers are outside the patient's \nhome county. The Nevada Public Option will be offered to individuals, families \nand small businesses, providing health insurance through the Exchange. As the \nMayor of West Wendover, a rural community that struggles yearly with access \nto affordable health care, I stand in strong support of S.B. 420. \n \nPHILIP MALINAS, M.D.: \nI support S.B. 420. I am a psychiatrist in Reno. As a medical professional, I \nsupport  this  bill  and  urge  the  policymakers  to  expand  healthcare  access  by \npassing the Public Option. I have submitted my written remarks (Exhibit P). \n \nTHERESA BOHANNAN: \nI  support  S.B.  420.  I  am  a  mother  of  two  with  a  child  who  has  a  severe \ncongenital heart defect. I have long been an advocate for a Public Option and to \nfix  the  problems  the  ACA  was  unable  to  address  initially.  Not  having  a \nPublic Option was one of the main barriers to accessing affordable health care \nfor everyone nationwide. As many of the previous speakers stated, the high \nnumber of uninsured people in our State would be helped by lowering costs. \nWhile addressing this bill, we also need to look at maximum out-of-pocket rates \nand  deductibles;  the  cost-sharing  for  patients  has  been  increasingly \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nunattainable. I am coordinating care for my son in Las Vegas and wondering \nhow I am going to pay for airfare and hotel expenses. There are additional costs \noutside of the costs for health care which people are struggling to maintain. \nDuring the pandemic and when it was unsure how safe schools were, I looked \nat the option of leaving my job and looked at the Exchange. The out-of-pocket \nrates were incredibly high, about $13,000. As a parent of a child with special \nneeds,  I  have  met  those  maximum  out-of-pocket  costs  with  my  son's  care \ntotaling over $2 million, and he is 5 years old. I know quite well the struggles \nthat patients go through every day. \n \nENDER AUSTIN III (Faith in Action Nevada): \nWe support S.B. 420. I am speaking on behalf of many of our leaders across the \nState who have expressed reasons why they support this bill. This legislation \nallows for increased access, mobility and fostering equity in health care. Access \nto health care is a moral imperative. Access to health care allowed a mother \nwho was dying to live a dignified life in her final days of life. It was important \nthis mother maintain a state of normalcy even as her illnesses was progressing. \nPreacher David Ross spoke to me about the importance of health care when he \nfaced  a  heart  procedure  that  cost  $250,000.  If  he  did  not  have  health \ninsurance, he would have absolutely been put in debt that he would not have \nbeen  able  to  take  care  of.  Pastor  Jo  Harris  spoke  vigorously  about  the \nimportance of health care for Black men who face unique health disparities \nexacerbated by a lack of access to health care. In 2021, if America catches a \ncold, Black America has the flu. Another leader spoke about the importance of \nher patients being able to keep their health insurance while they transition from \njob to job. Senate Bill 420 allows folks to carry their health insurance from one \njob to another, alleviating some of the challenges we have with racial disparities \nand  ensuring  there  is  a  better  quality  of  life  for  many  others,  as  well  as \nproviding financial security. \n \nTOM CLARK (Nevada Association of Health Plans): \nWe oppose S.B. 420, primarily the sections dealing with the Public Option. \nI represent the private insurance companies that operate in Nevada. The most \nimportant  concern  we  have  is  cost—cost  on  implementation,  creating  and \nmanaging this new Public Option. The second biggest issue we have is access \nto care. When there are challenging things that occur within health care, we \ntend to find solutions. The healthcare system in Nevada is a system. When you \nlook at insurance, it is broken down in a number of different ways. There are \nlarge-group, small-group and individual markets, self-funded plans, Medicare and \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nMedicaid. About 11 percent of the Medicaid folks are the uninsured. The reason \nI bring up those other kinds of insurance is because the system operates as a \nsystem. With the Public Option concept, if you set the rate and compress a \nportion of the market, the remaining areas in the system expand to cover and \nsubsidize  the  costs  of  the  compression.  We  contemplate  that  under  this \nlegislation, there will be a cost shift where you may see a set price under the \nPublic Option, but those folks who are in those other elements of insurance will \nsee an increase in the cost of their insurance. \n \nThere are 100,000 Medicaid eligible people who could enroll. There are about \n80,000 people who qualify for zero-cost insurance through the Exchange. We \nneed to work to get those people into that system.  \n \nThis bill does not contemplate the increasing price of pharmaceutical drugs. We \nhave done work as insurers for years to increase the number of providers we \nhave, rural and urban and across-the-board disciplines, to bring them in. We fear \nthe impact S.B. 420 will have on network adequacy will be detrimental. Under \nthis  proposal,  the  healthcare  delivery  system  access  will  be  impacted. \nExperience  tells  us  a  Public  Option  of  this  nature  will  be  expensive,  and \nhealthcare costs for all Nevadans will increase while access will decline.  \n \nJAMES WADHAMS (Nevada Hospital Association): \nWe oppose S.B. 420. We support the notion of a Public Option; however, we \nhave issues with this bill. The one element missing in the bill is a prerequisite for \nan actuarial study. This population needs to be analyzed and studied so the \nmorbidity and healthcare characteristics can be understood. That should not be \ndifficult if a portion of this population is already Medicaid eligible and is available \nto simply getting them enrolled. That will cut this approximately by a third to a \nhalf, depending upon how it is calculated. There needs to be an actuarial study \nso that both the insurers know what they are insuring, and the providers know \nwhat they are delivering service to.  \n \nOne of the issues is that cost-sharing should not be an issue because it is \nalready part of the system. Medicaid reimbursements are substantially below \ncost,  and  unfortunately,  the  Medicare  reimbursements  are  also  below  cost. \nUsing a Medicare or Medicaid system as a basis mandates the cost system will \nbe less than the cost to prepare and deliver those healthcare services. That \ncreates a problem; when costs exceed the revenues, then adjustments will have \nto  be  made.  It  is  either  passed  on  to  the  commercial  market,  that  is,  the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nemployers that are not eligible to participate will have to begin picking up that \ncost, or it can impact into the workforce and jobs, which is the largest cost \nfactor in facilities and will have to be addressed. We tend to think it will erode \nthe  small  group  and  individual  plans,  particularly  those  that  are  being  put \ntogether by the Chambers of Commerce that have been so successful. \n \nThe ultimate problem as we find insurance for more people is that we have to \nbe careful we do not decrease the access. The concern is that by mandating \ncertain providers to participate, we may lose those certain providers from those \nother elements of care, for example, delivering care to the Public Employees \nBenefit Plan, injured workers and State Medicaid. For us in the hospital world, \nnurses  and  doctors  are  the  lifeblood  that  flows  in  these  facilities,  and  the \nadequacy of our workforce is critical to the delivery of care which was stressed \nso much in the last 15 months. Without those people willing to put themselves \non  the  frontline  and  the  facilities  adjusting  capacity,  it  would  have  been  a \nproblem. \n \nAs you review this bill, remember that costs come in different components. It is \nthe out-of-pocket costs to the consumer, cost of insurance and ultimately the \ncost to deliver healthcare service by the providers. We have to be sensitive to \nwhere all of those costs go. \n \nGiven the financial risks of setting up a public option at Medicare baseline rates \nfor physicians, the Nevada State Medical Association urges the Legislature to \nconsider  the  impact  and  policy  of  the  long-term  sustainability  of  physician \npractices  and  ultimately  the  access  to  care  for  Nevadans.  We  ask  the \nLegislature to refrain from using rates as the core of physicians’ payments under \nthis Public Option. Despite our concerns, there are some sections in the bill that \nwe support, which are reflected in my written submission (Exhibit Q). \n \nJARON HILDEBRAND (Nevada State Medical Association): \nWe  oppose  S.B.  420.  Our  membership  consists  of  the  majority  of  Nevada \nphysicians, but we consider ourselves first and foremost as a patient advocacy \norganization. We do share the priority of approving access and affordability of \nhealthcare  insurance.  Covering  the  uninsured  and  improving  healthcare \noutcomes and affordability have a long-standing priority for the Nevada State \nMedical Association. We are not opposed to the Public Option but today we are \nin opposition to S.B. 420 as written. We have concerns with payment parity \nwith respect to doulas, midwives and nurse practitioners. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nThe mandate in section 23 is another area of concern. We support physicians' \nfreedom of choice when it comes to healthcare plan participation and therefore, \nwe opposed the effort to require physicians' participation in the Public Option by \ntying  it  to  the  participation  of  other  State-based  programs.  This  mandatory \nparticipation provision overlooks the complexities of running a physician practice \nand in determining the capacity and ability of a practice to serve a patient mix. \nThere are many reasons as to why a practice may not participate with the plan. \nBurdensome administrative policies, saturation of practice resources, physician \ntime, engagement in alternative payment models, pending retirement and so on. \nIt is critical that the physicians are able to weigh in on the contract options and \nmake the decisions of what it is best for them, their practice, patients and staff.  \n \nThe next issue we have are the Medicare reimbursement rates in section 14 of \nthis bill that would establish provider payments using Medicare rates as a floor. \nWe fear these rates will become a defective rate for all Public Option contracts. \nMedicare  rates  have  not  covered  costs  of  providing  care  in  the  commercial \nmarket. According to data from the Medicare trustees and Medicare physicians, \npay has barely increased in nearly two decades. Written testimony (Exhibit R) \nand supporting documents (Exhibit S) have been submitted by the Nevada State \nMedical Association. \n \nMICHAEL HILLERBY (Renown Health; Hometown Health): \nWe oppose S.B. 420. While we support the concept of a Public Option focused \non providing coverage for the uninsured, we do oppose this bill. We would like \nto work with you and others to design a program that works for Nevada without \njeopardizing access to care or current options for coverage. We are acutely \naware of the importance of the payer mix as we strive to manage costs and \nmake the most efficient use of public and private dollars. When the number of \npatients  increase  in  Medicaid,  Medicare  and  other  programs  that  reimburse \nbelow cost, or for those who are uninsured, the cost burden shifts to providers \nand private health insurance patients. That impacts the number of providers \nwilling to enroll in these programs and see new patients. \n \nNevada ranks low in physicians, nurses and other primary care providers per \ncapita.  Nevada  has  among  the  lowest  Medicaid  reimbursement  rates  for \nhospitals in America. Our delivery system is fragile and sensitive to even small \nchanges in the payer mix. The same is true for the private insurance market for \nbusinesses and individuals. We cannot implement a new Public Option before \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nwe study and address the risk of losing providers in our system or making \nNevada a less attractive place to practice medicine. \n \nSenate  Bill  420  seeks  to  address  the  large  population  of  patients  who  are \neligible but not enrolled in Medicaid or subsidized Exchange plans. There is a \n37 percent  population  eligible  for  Medicaid  and  20  percent  or  more  for \nsubsidized coverage on the Exchange. We should focus on these areas before \nimplementing a new Public Option. We would like to work with you and the \nlarger healthcare community to continue the work done through S.C.R. No. 10 \nof the 80th Session, the Patient Protection Commission and the Committee to \nConduct an Interim Study Concerning the Costs of Prescription Drugs. If we are \nto build a Public Option that addresses the unique Nevada marketplace, work \nfirst needs to be done in the following areas: increase presumptive eligibility \noptions  to  better  capture  more  Medicaid  eligible  patients  and  help  them \ncomplete full enrollment; explore expanded Exchange enrollment opportunities, \nfor example, at point of care, and create something like Medicaid presumptive \neligibility for the Exchange. \n \nThe  actuarial  study  allowed  in  the  bill  must  be  mandatory  if  we  are  to \nunderstand the risk pool and the viability of any Public Option to avoid the \nresults seen in the state of Washington. This is also reflected in the early years \nof our own Exchange and lack of coverage in rural counties. Also, remove the \nsmall-employer eligibility provision must be removed. This will exacerbate the \ncost shifting problem and create more uncertainty in a small, fragile private \ninsurance market. \n \nWe must also address Medicaid rates, including the cuts made last summer. We \nneed  to  align  Medicare  reimbursement  with  value-based  care  and  patient \noutcomes,  helping  drive  better  access  to  the  best  care  in  the  appropriate \nsetting. This is a crucial step to deal with both access and the budget realities \nyou face every day. We share your commitment to helping more patients access \ncare with viable coverage and look forward to working with the Legislature to \naddress  the  needs  and  best  plan  for  the  future  in  a  way  that  encourages \nproviders and payers the same. \n \nSUSAN FISHER (Nevada State Society of Anesthesiologists): \nWe oppose S.B. 420. It was mentioned earlier that 35 percent of Nevadans \neligible for Medicaid are not enrolled, and we need to figure out why. People are \nnot  signing  up  for  Medicaid  because  physicians  who  can  choose  are  not \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \naccepting additional Medicaid patients. Unfortunately, we have physicians who \ncannot choose so they accept Medicaid patients and are losing money in their \npractices.  I  have  submitted  a  letter  from  the  Nevada  Society  of \nAnesthesiologists (Exhibit T) with details on our opposition to S.B. 420. \n \nANN SILVER (Reno + Sparks Chamber of Commerce): \nWe oppose S.B. 420. This bill would increase costs to our chamber businesses \nand their employees, reduce competition and choice for working Nevada families \nand possibly deter physicians from establishing much-needed practices in our \nState. We do support decreasing insurance costs and increasing availability. We \nare proud of the Reno + Sparks Chamber Association's health plan. We are able \nto  offer  affordable  comprehensive  vision,  dental,  medical  and  life  insurance \nplans to any small business with between two and fifty employees. This plan \ncovers thousands of lives across the State. \n \nSenate Bill 420 would not reduce the high cost of health care in Nevada. It \nwould, however, demand insurance premium reductions for a finite number of \nNevadans and increase the cost to a larger proportion of the population. Your \nhelp is needed in creating incentives to medical residencies, encouraging and \nfunding  healthcare  credentialing  and  refraining  from  establishing  arbitrary \ngovernment-set reimbursement rates. Your priorities should include encouraging \ndoctors to work in our State and rewarding students who choose careers in \nhealth care. We ask that you rethink this bill and instead establish a task force \nto explore healthcare affordability and existing products in the Nevada market. \nWe  have  enough  choices  without  adding  a  distraction  that  will  ultimately \ndiminish the healthcare industry, leaving it without a chance to compete and \nsucceed. \n \nSCOTT MUELRATH (Henderson Chamber of Commerce): \nWe oppose S.B. 420. We have submitted our opposition testimony (Exhibit U). \n \nCONNOR CAIN (Hospital Corporation of America; Sunrise Hospital and Medical \nCenter;  Mountain  View  Hospital;  Southern  Hills  Hospital  and  Medical \nCenter): \nWe  oppose  S.B.  420.  In  the  last  year,  our  hospitals  have  cared  for  nearly \n10,000 Covid-19-positive patients and ensured that Nevadans, including those \nin vulnerable zip codes, had  access to free, life-saving monoclonal antibody \ntreatments  all  while  sustaining  difficult  Medicaid  cuts  brought  on  by  the \npandemic's  crushing  impact  to  our  State  budget.  We  worry  that  the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nPublic Option  proposal  will  not  work  for  Nevada's  unique  healthcare \nenvironment  and  will  have  negative  consequences  for  both  patients  and \nproviders. At Sunrise Hospital, which is the largest provider of Medicaid services \nin our State, 15  percent of our patients are covered through commercial and \nmanaged-care insurance. Any shift in patients from commercial plans to a Public \nOption will reimburse at a far lower rate, threaten the ability of hospitals like \nSunrise to offer services and lose vulnerable members of our community who \nrely upon us so heavily. \n \nThere are other ways to expand health insurance coverage in Nevada. First, \nover 50 percent of uninsured Nevadans are eligible for Medicaid or subsidies on \nthe  Exchange  but  not  enrolled.  We  should  increase  efforts  to  ensure  these \npeople are enrolled. Second, Nevada has the highest share of those ineligible for \ncoverage  due  to  immigration  status.  If  we  truly  want  to  expand  insurance \ncoverage, we as a State should ensure all those who would otherwise lack \ncoverage are eligible for Medicaid. President Joe Biden is proposing a permanent \nextension of expanded pre-age subsidies available for private insurance in the \npublic  marketplace.  The  idea  is  to  build  in  the  ACA.  We  encourage  you  to \nsupport President Biden's approach to make health care more affordable. We \nhope this body will consider expanding coverage through enhanced enrollment \nefforts and coverage to otherwise ineligible Nevadans. \n \nMARY BETH SEWALD (Vegas Chamber): \nWe oppose S.B. 420. We share the goal that every Nevadan should have access \nto affordable health coverage. This bill will not reduce healthcare costs, rather it \nwill shift costs to other Nevadans. Mandating a State insurance plan to offer a \nrate 5 percent lower than commercial rates is another cost shift. Evidence from \nother  states  that  have  implemented  similar  programs  confirm  that  insurance \ncosts  went  up.  An  actuarial  study  should  be  conducted  before  this  bill  is \npassed. There are also concerns about requiring healthcare providers to accept \ngovernment-set  reimbursement  rates.  It  will  reduce  providers  to  accept \nMedicaid, push doctors out and make it more difficult to find physicians. Let us \nexpand  on  insurance  coverage  we  already  have,  enroll  more  people  into \nMedicaid, the State Exchange and Association healthcare plans. There are at \nleast 30 percent of uninsured Nevadans who are Medicaid eligible. Enrolling \nthem in Medicaid now would automatically reduce the uninsured population by \nmore than 100,000 lives. Raising reimbursement rates and addressing shortages \nof healthcare providers are also solutions that will help cover more Nevadans. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nPETER GUZMAN (Latin Chamber of Commerce): \nWe oppose S.B. 420. This bill is risky, overreaching and reckless legislation that \nwill  result  in  an  increased  cost  of  care  to  Nevadans  who  enrolled  within \nemployer-provided healthcare plans. This bill could reduce competition in the \nmarketplace as well as consumer choice. Unfortunately, this is done with well \nintention,  but  there  are  unintended  consequences  for  which  people  will  pay \ndearly. \n \nMARCOS LOPEZ (Americans for Prosperity Nevada): \nWe oppose S.B. 420. Our written testimony has been submitted (Exhibit V). \n \nCYRUS HOJJATY: \nI am in neutral on S.B. 420. I am confident this bill will reduce costs and bring \ncompetition to insurance plans. I would like more evidence on where similar \nideas have been tried. I am concerned about immigration status and that an \nunequal situation could be created by noncitizens taking more than they actually \npaid back. The ACA has not lowered premiums; it has raised premiums. I would \nlike to learn from other countries, particularly Europe, where they pay far less \nper capita for health insurance than we do here. \n \nIt is not just health insurance that concerns me. I want to make sure this bill \nunderstands why people are getting so sick. We have alarmingly high obesity \nrates. We need to understand what is causing these types of illnesses. \n \nNANCY BOWEN (Nevada Primary Care Association): \nWe are neutral on S.B. 420. We support affordable quality health care for all \nNevadans, and a Public Option could be an important tool to expand access to \nunderserved communities. We appreciate that S.B. 420 establishes payment for \nour health centers on par with what they receive from Medicare or Medicaid. \nWe support the expansion of Medicaid coverage to pregnant women above the \ncurrent income eligibility level, and for doulas and community health workers to \nextend the ability of our health centers to provide care outside the clinic. We \nhave long advocated for the expansion of managed care so our rural patients \ncan access specialists in rural population centers. \n \nWe have concerns about the effects of S.B. 420 on the future of managed care \nin the State and on the viability of our hospitals and other referral partners. We \nhave heard the concerns from these essential community partners, and we are \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \nwithholding our support until we understand more about the likely impact of this \nbill on them. \n \nAMBER FEDERIZO, APRN, FNP-BC (Hemostasis and Thrombosis Center of Nevada): \nWe are neutral on S.B. 420. Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) in Nevada \nthat cover Medicare recipients are not required to credential providers even if \nthe provider is willing or if the provider is the only federally-recognized center of \nexcellence for the treatment of bleeding disorders and clotting disorders in this \nState. For example, Smart Choice, Medicaid and Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act plans, such as the Culinary plan, continue to deny access to their \nmembers to the State's only federally-recognized hemophilia treatment center in \nNevada, and their  members  continue to pay cash to access care. We have \nprovided research to both of these payers that this specialized care delivered as \na Health Resources and Services Administration program reduces mortality and \nmorbidity  by  40  percent  at  a  cost  savings.  This  data  was  published  in  a \npeer-review journal and has not made a difference.  \n \nThis bill does not require MCOs providing care to Medicaid recipients or those \nwho  will  be  offering  a  Public  Option  a  contract  in  good  faith  with  all  the \nproviders  who  already  contract  for  fee-for-service  Medicaid.  We  have  been \nwilling to accept any contract made in good faith. We have been denied by \nsome  insurance  companies  stating  they  have  an  adequate  network  despite \nhaving no federally-recognized hemophilia treatment in their network. We look \nforward to the evolution of this bill to better address network adequacies. \n \nSENATOR CANNIZZARO: \nWe  have  looked  at  and  studied  the  Medicare  buy-in  since  before  the \n2017 Session, and there were issues with that. There was additional analysis \ndone in the last Legislative Session and proposed legislation which was not \nquite hitting the mark. We passed S.C.R. No. 10 of the 80th Session and did an \nactuarial analysis during the Interim that came out with data. We know who the \npeople  are  who  are  uninsured,  and  now  the  question  is  how  to  get  them \ninsured. That is exactly what we are trying to do.  \n \nThis bill, in contrast with bills in other states, provides for lead time for DHHS to \nput together a program that will work, and it provides the time to study the \npossibilities in the Interim and provides a procurement period that would take \ninto consideration all of those points that have been made. We are past the \npoint as to why we should not support S.B. 420 and we should continue to look \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \nat this or figure out who these people are or figure out how we should study \nthis more. We know who they are and I have talked to them at their doors. \nI would encourage you to knock on ten doors in your neighborhood and let me \nknow how many people talk to you about the cost of health care. I am willing to \nstate it is a fair number. \n \nCost shifts have come up a lot during testimony. When we are talking about the \nindividuals  who  are  qualifying  for  these  of  plans,  most  of  them  are \nuncompensated care right now. Those cost shifts are happening in the market \nright now. Yes, there will be cost shifts; we are dealing with health care. There \nare costs associated with multinational employer plans that are the best plans \nyou can have that are paying premiums or your employer is helping you pay \nthose premiums and providing that health care. You cannot say because there \nare costs associated with it we should do nothing to help these people who do \nnot have care or accessing it. When we talk about cost shifts, which is the \ncurrent  reality  of  our  system,  there  is  money  that  is  being  made  in  the \nhealthcare space. When we talk about cost shifts, what are we talking about? \nWe are talking about people who are not accessing that care because they do \nnot have health insurance. That is what S.B. 420 is getting at. \n \nIt is perplexing to me that the biggest argument is what we really should be \ndoing is expanding people on Medicaid. To say that if we expanded people on \nMedicaid and eligibility for Medicaid and providers and insurers were provided \nthose Medicaid rates, that this would be a better alternative to putting someone \non a health plan where they are paying premiums, and if this bill passes as is, \nthat floor is Medicare reimbursement. Adding people to Medicaid and saying \nthey would take more Medicaid patients and get reimbursed at a Medicaid rate \nis what we should do instead of implementing health insurance, and in the same \nbreath making the comment and argument about cost shifting, is perplexing \nbecause Medicaid rates are low. If we are talking about implementing something \nwhere  you  are  getting  reimbursed  higher  than  Medicaid  rates,  I  struggle  to \nunderstand why that is a reason to oppose this bill.  \n \nA comment was made that the government is setting the Medicare rates and \nthis is only Medicare compensation—this is not what S.B. 420 is. One of the \nconcerns we had through the Interim and discussions with stakeholders was \nthey would end up with Medicaid rates, so we tried to put a floor into the bill to \nprovide reassurance they would not be getting the Medicaid rates. What this \nintends to do, and with the ability of the State’s purchasing power and apply for \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \nwaivers and subsidies, the health insurers should be negotiating with providers \nfor those rates knowing that is the floor. This is going to incentivize them to \nprovide those value-based plans that are showing real health outcomes. This is \nnot the government setting rates. It is not a State-run program being subsidized \nby the taxpayers. This is allowing the State to get creative and innovative. We \ncannot study this anymore. That time has come and gone. We have the studies \nand the data. Even so, provisions in this bill allow for actuarial analysis and the \n1332 waiver will require that. If this gives people more assurance, I am happy \nto negotiate on the terms of the bill to ensure that does happen as this is our \nintent. \n \nWe  have  talked  about  the  percentages  of  the  premiums.  In  Colorado,  after \nnegotiations, there was an 18 percent reduction in premiums starting in 2022. \nWe are giving lead time. We are at 15 percent over 4 years after the plan is \nenacted.  That  is  worth  consideration.  With  respect  to  provider  participation \nrequirements, those have worked in Minnesota. We have data that does work, \nand this is the right thing to do and something that will provide that additional \npiece. If the idea that there were enough choices and we do not need any more \nchoices, then Nevada would not be seventh in the Nation for uninsured at a \npersistently high rate where we are the only State in that seven that did elect to \ndo Medicaid expansion. That has to tell you a lot about whether there is an \nissue here, whether there are sufficient choices and what we should be doing \nabout it. This does not affect employer-based health plans or association health \nplans. We are talking about how to provide affordable and accessible health \ncare to Nevadans when we know there is an issue and this is a step in the right \ndirection. We are still working with some people on amendments, and we will \ncontinue that work. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI  will  now  close  public  testimony  on  S.B.  420  and  open  the  hearing  on \nA.B. 205. \n \nASSEMBLY  BILL  205  (1st  Reprint):  Makes  various  changes  concerning  the \nacquisition,  possession,  provision  or  administration  of  auto-injectable \nepinephrine and opioid antagonists by schools. (BDR 40-98) \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 27 \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN LESLEY E. COHEN (Assembly District No. 29): \nI will present A.B. 205 and have submitted my written remarks (Exhibit W). \nTrey Delap from Group Six Partners will be presenting with me and has worked \nin behavioral health, addiction and recovery policy for years. \n \nTREY DELAP (Director, Group Six Partners LLC): \nI will provide background data for the Committee's consideration. The reason \nthis is relevant at the moment is because there has been a substantial increase \nin overdose deaths in 2020, especially for young people under 17 years of age. \nAll overdose deaths recorded in 2020 were unintentional opioid overdose deaths \nattributable to fentanyl. Overall, the State saw a 29 percent increase in the \ndeaths by overdose of opioids in the adult population. Synthetic opioids account \nfor two times the overdose deaths of heroin, and teen deaths are on the rise. \nThe number of young people who die by overdose of synthetic opioids equals \ndouble  the  peak  year  of  the  opioid  epidemic  in  2011.  The  sum  of  opioid \noverdose  deaths  in  2020  alone  in  the  8-  to  17-year-old  population  was \none-third of the total number of the same population in the previous decade and \na significant spike. Prevalence of opioids among young people is relatively high. \nYoung people have access and are using illicit drugs. Approximately 35 percent \nof young people in Grades 8, 10 and 12 have used illicit drugs during their \nlifetimes.  Of  those,  27  percent  have  used  drugs  in  the  preceding  year.  An \nexample is if youths reported they had used illicit drugs in the eighth grade, this \nmeans sometime between seventh and eighth grade they have used illicit drugs. \n \nThis gives us pause to look back at what the opioid epidemic has been and how \nit  has  evolved.  In  1995,  Oxycontin  hit  the  market  and  the  Fifth  Vital  Sign \ncampaign urged healthcare providers to take pain as seriously as other vital \nsigns. I was a junior in high school working in a hospital, and this was the \nchange that was going on there. Also in 1995, the State Board of Pharmacy \nactivated the Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP), one of the first in the \nCountry. Between 1995 and 2015, an opioid epidemic erupted and the Nevada \nLegislature enacted the Good Samaritan Drug Overdose Act in 2015. The first \nthing the Nevada Legislature did in response to the opioid epidemic was to \ncreate a harm reduction and safe harbor encouragement for people to intercede \nwhen opioid overdose was occurring. In 2017, a comprehensive overhaul of \nprescribing  occurred  and  the  PMP  became  mandatory.  Looking  at  opioids \nglobally, the U.S. is the largest consumer of morphine, counting for 40 percent \nof the world's consumption of morphine. This is an indication we have a future \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 28 \n \nthat will include opioids, and this is part of the connection we are looking at for \nschools. \n \nThe U.S. consumes 20 percent of the world's fentanyl. The public sentiment, \nabout 51 percent of the population, regard the opioid epidemic as a serious \nproblem. Sixty-seven percent of the public perceive there is lack of access or \nfunding for treatment or mitigating services with regard to the opioid epidemic. \nFifty-six percent of people agree that the opioid epidemic negatively impacted \nlocal economies and job growth. The number of overdose deaths from heroin \nbetween  1999  and  2019  dropped.  Approximately  20  percent  fewer  deaths \nwere from heroin, but those deaths were picked up by fentanyl overdoses which \nwas 29 percent.  \n \nWith regard to the specific impact on children, 2.2 million children are directly \naffected by parental opioid use or their own use. Approximately 2 million young \npeople were affected primarily by parental use. They were either living with a \nparent with opioid use disorder, had lost a parent to an opioid-related death, had \na parent in prison or jail because of opioids, or had been removed from their \nhome  due  to  an  opioid-related  issue.  An  additional  170,000  children  had \nopioid-use  disorder  themselves  or  had  accidentally  ingested  opioids.  Young \npeople have overdosed on opioids that were in the house. Of the 2.2 million \nchildren  directly  affected  by  the  opioid  epidemic,  41 percent  are  ages  5  or \nyounger, 32 percent are between the ages of 6 and 11, and 27 percent are \nbetween the ages of 12 and 17. \n \nThings have changed. In 2017, the PMP became mandatory. This was designed \nto target the first phase of the opioid epidemic which was overprescribing, and \nwe  have  seen  a  drop  in  opioid  prescriptions.  The  average  daily  morphine \nmilligram  equivalent  per  opioid  prescription  has  decreased  as  well.  The  raw \nnumber  of  prescriptions  have  gone  down,  and  the  quantity  and  amount  of \npotency have dropped. \n \nInnovations, such as the online JAVA House of Medicine newsletter response to \nthe opioid epidemic, is coprescribing naloxone and Narcan. The U.S. Department \nof  Veterans  Affairs  (VA)  has  been  doing  this  for  a  while.  The  VA  writes \nprescriptions for opioids, Narcan and naloxone and will educate others in the \nhousehold on its use. The top three prescribers by category writing prescriptions \nfor  naloxone  are  psychiatry,  addiction  medicine  and  pediatricians,  which \naccount  for  the  third  largest  group  of  prescribers  writing  for  naloxone.  The \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 29 \n \nAmerican  Academy  of  Pediatrics  (AAP)  has  identified  this  as  part  of  the \nmitigation  of  harm  and  awareness  of  the  impact  of  the  opioid  epidemic  on \nchildren. The AAP has been engaging, analyzing and monitoring the impact of \nchildren going into the foster care system. The AAP published a number of \narticles about families affected by parental substance abuse. This connects to \nthe availability of opioids in the house and children able to get access to them \nand also the strong market and demand.  \n \nThe profitability of synthetic fentanyl is tremendous. If a drug dealer has one \nkilogram of the source material, the dealer has two choices, make a kilogram of \nheroin or 20 kilograms of fentanyl. A kilogram of heroin will yield $80,000 in \nrevenue;  20 kilograms  of  synthetic  fentanyl  opioids  will  yield  $1.6 million  in \nrevenue. There is demand in the prevalence, use and awareness and certainly a \nprofit motive. \n \nNevada policy makers have seen this spike and are doing what they can with \npublic education. Following the last Session, the Nevada Institute for Children's \nResearch  and  Policy  prepared  a  policy  brief  specifically  addressing  the \navailability  of  naloxone  in  public  schools.  All  this  information  suggests  we \nshould  do  something.  The  opioid  epidemic  has  been  an  all-hands-on-deck \nresponse. This is an important piece of legislation. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN COHEN: \nThe Health Department has reported the age range of use of opioids is falling to \nsuch an extent that the average age has fallen from 49 years old to 29 years \nold. The federal government, in an effort to stop the health crisis, has been \ngiving  out  opioid  antagonists  to  prevent  overdose  without  qualification.  The \nNevada  Osteopathic  Medical  Association,  National  Association  of  School \nNurses, and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration of the \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services have confirmed that Narcan is \nsafe and can be given without harm. According to the Nevada Osteopathic \nMedical Association,  \n \nNaloxone (Narcan) is a safe and effective drug for the treatment of \nsuspected opioid overdoses … the drug is administered to a person \nwho  is  not  experiencing  a  narcotic  overdose  but  other  medical \nevent, it will not cause harm.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 30 \n \nSomeone overdosing from an opioid will die without intervention. Often lives are \nlost  waiting  for  the  ambulance  to  arrive.  The  naloxone  administered  while \nwaiting  for  the  ambulance  saves  lives.  It  is  safe  and  more  benign  than \nepinephrine and does not harm someone who is not overdosing.  \n \nAt different times, naloxone kits have been distributed to different people in the \nbuilding. These were purchased with money from the federal government. The \nNevada  State  Opioid  Response  reports  the  distribution  of  13,185  kits  and \nreversals from the use of naloxone for 932 Nevadans who would have died if \nthey  did  not  receive  naloxone.  The  kit  I  have  from  Partnership  Carson  City \ncontains gloves, information on opioids, instructions and a couple of naloxone \nsprays. You do not have to have training to use the kit, you simply read the \npamphlet  and  can  save  someone's  life.  Organizations  such  as  Partnership \nCarson City provide free monthly training for approximately 30 to 60 minutes. \nThe administration of naloxone itself takes about 10 minutes. The training also \nstresses calling for medical help.  \n \nThis bill is enabling language and no mandate. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI can see this bill is built on the work of former Nevada Senator Debbie Smith on \nthe epinephrine legislation with a high level of confidence that this can save \nlives. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN COHEN: \nThis bill was also built on the work of Assemblyman John Hambrick in the last \nSession. The bill was not quite there at the end of the Session. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will now close the hearing on A.B. 205 and open the hearing on A.B. 96. \n \nASSEMBLY  BILL  96  (1st  Reprint):  Revises  provisions  relating  to  emergency \nresponse employees. (BDR 40-96) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN LESLEY E. COHEN (ASSEMBLY DISTRICT NO. 29): \nI  am  presenting  A.B. 96  which  came  from  my  interest  in  peer  support  for \nfirst responders. I have submitted my prepared remarks (Exhibit X). \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 31 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe are seeing many bills this Session which have the language \"within the \nlimits of available money\" or \"as money is available.” Is there anything we are \ndoing out of the Nevada Office of Suicide Prevention or any of the behavioral \nhealth initiatives or anything along those lines which align with this bill? Are \nthere other efforts the Committee should know about in terms of making sure \nour emergency responders have the behavioral support they need? \n \nMARGOT  CHAPPEL  (Deputy  Administrator,  Regulatory  and  Planning  Services, \nDivision  of  Public  and  Behavioral  Health,  Department  of  Health  and \nHuman Services): \nWe are looking at the fees for license for our emergency medical services (EMS) \nfolks, and the advisory committee will be given an opportunity to fund and \nincrease those fees. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThere is a peer support line that is operating for EMS providers today? \n \nMS. CHAPPEL: \nYes.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe idea then is that the framework is built and there is someone already doing \nit, but if money could be found, we could expand on those efforts. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN COHEN: \nThere  is  a  program  in  northern  Nevada  working  on  a  program  for  southern \nNevada. This program is about getting information out there. There is also a \ndata collection piece to this bill to gather data about suicide attempts, and \nsuicide and first responders. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe data collection is also to the extent money is available. Hopefully, we can \nfind a path to do meaningful work. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN COHEN: \nI agree. There are also the pieces about getting the information out and having a \nplace  for  the  information  to  flow  through.  It  is  not  just  coming  from \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 32 \n \na not-for-profit, but the State is providing that information to people who might \nbe looking for it. \n \nANTHONY YARBROUGH (Veterans of Foreign Wars): \nWe  support  A.B.  96.  Many  first  responders  who  are  law  enforcement  and \nfirefighters come from the ranks of our military and veterans. For that reason, \nwe recognize one of the biggest challenges we face today is a high rate of \nsuicide among our members. There is a different world for an average civilian \nwho has to deal with trauma, death and carnage, and the difficulty of actively \nperforming their jobs on a daily basis. We recognize this could impact veterans, \nand we want to support that.  \n \nSuicide prevention is our No. 1 goal, and we recognize peer support is a proven \nfoundation  of  success.  It  helps  to  identify  the  causation  as  well  as  the \nprevention. This is a good start since we have not been able to stop suicide—all \nwe  can  do  is  try  to  prevent  it.  The  peer  support  volunteers  go  through  a \ncombination of training, exercise, counseling and peer advocacy. Please support \nthis bill. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThe VA has trained peer-to-peer specialists to support veterans. To the extent \nmoney is available, we may be able to collaborate with the VA, and if not at the \nfederal level, we should probably be able to do something with the Nevada \nDepartment of Veterans Services. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will now close the hearing on A.B. 96. The hearing on A.B. 217 is now open. \n \nASSEMBLY  BILL  217:  Requires  training  for  unlicensed  caregivers  at  certain \nfacilities. (BDR 40-454) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN LESLEY E. COHEN (Assembly District No. 29): \nI am presenting A.B. 217 which came out of the Interim 2019-2020 Legislative \nCommittee on Health Care. I have submitted my written remarks (Exhibit Y). \n \nMS. CHAPPEL: \nDuring the pandemic, we witnessed quite a few citations in facilities where \nunlicensed  caregivers  worked.  We  saw  people  working  in  the  kitchen  who \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 33 \n \nprepared  food  without  a  mask  and  other  violations  performed  by  untrained, \nunlicensed caregivers. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nMany of us were on the Interim Committee that asked for this bill to be moved \nforward. \n \nMR. GOLD: \nAARP Nevada  supports  A.B.  217.  Sometimes  the  State  is  good  for  these \nunlicensed personnel. These employees are fingerprinted, background checked \nand tuberculosis tested, but sometimes that is all that is required. I think it is \nimportant  when  people  bring  a  family  member,  or  they  themselves  go  to \nfacilities which have unlicensed staff with caretaking responsibilities, that the \nemployees know what they are doing. A lot of these facilities, such as homes \nfor individual residential care, have overnight staff, kitchen staff and caregivers. \nWe  are  not  sure  how  they  are  trained  and  tested.  The  licensed  staff  have \nestablished training regimens, which is great. This bill is the best way to ensure \nunlicensed personnel are trained and tested properly. We have to protect the \nmost vulnerable people who live in or get treatment at these facilities. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWhen this bill passes, or even before it passes, these facilities will take to heart \nwhat our intention is and not wait until January 1, 2022, to have regulations to \nforce them to implement training for their unlicensed personnel.  \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN COHEN: \nThis is a modicum of regulations for training of people who are dealing with our \nmost vulnerable population, whether it is infectious disease control or helping \nget someone on a bus without hurting the individual.   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 4, 2021 \nPage 34 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will now close the hearing on A.B. 217.

(BDR 40-799) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN DANIELE MONROE-MORENO (Assembly District No. 1): \nI am here today to present A.B. 287, a measure providing for the licensing and \nregulation of freestanding birthing centers. \n \nAssembly Bill No. 169 of the 80th Session was presented and passed, which \nestablished the Maternal Mortality Review Committee. \n \nIt was important to pass that legislation because maternal mortality was, and \ncontinues to be, rising in the U.S. as it declines elsewhere. We continue to be \nthe only high-resource Country whose rates are rising. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nBlack women face significantly higher maternal mortality risk with 44 deaths per \n100,000  live  births  compared  to  their  White  counterparts.  Women  of  other \nraces are at 13 to 14 deaths per every 100,000 live births. \n \nThis is 2021, and we are still battling maternal mortality issues as we come out \nof the Covid-19 pandemic. During the beginning of the pandemic, women found \nthemselves forced to deliver without their partners and/or family members. That \nwas needed for the safety and protection of hospital staff and other patients, \nand the decision was warranted. It placed undue stress on families and the \npregnant woman as she went into labor and delivery. \n \nPeople were looking for options and reached out to me, asking for information \non  freestanding  birthing  centers.  There  were  constituents  in  my  district  not \ncomfortable with giving birth at home but did not feel there were any other \noptions.  \n \nAssembly Bill 287 defines a freestanding birthing center in section 11. \n \nTARA C. RAINES, PH.D., N.C.S.P.: \nAs I show my presentation (Exhibit B) on freestanding birthing centers and why \nthey would be beneficial for Nevadans, I will explain the definition of birthing \ncenters,  the  rise  in  birthing  center  utilization  in  the  U.S.,  some  outcomes \nassociated with birthing centers, potential cost savings, Strong Start data and \nhow birthing centers close the gap on health disparities. \n \nA birthing center is a safe healthcare facility where care is provided using the \nmidwifery model of care. We think of a birthing center as a “Maxi-home vs. a \nMini-hospital.” \n \nBirthing center care is integrated and guided by the principles of prevention, \nsensitivity,  safety,  appropriate  medical  intervention  and  cost-effectiveness. \nUsing the midwifery model of care, the birthing center helps with the transition \nfrom pregnancy to parenthood. \n \nBirthing centers respect and facilitate birthing persons’ rights to make informed \nchoices about their health care and the baby’s based on the parent’s values and \nbeliefs. Birthing centers allow the participation of the birthing person’s family \nand friends in the pregnancy, birth and immediate postpartum period. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nIn recent years, there has been a rise in birthing centers as they are found to \ngive  folks  access  to  the  births  of  their  choice.  In  the  U.S.,  there  are \n384 freestanding birthing centers, 11 of which are operated by Black owners. \nBirthing  centers  saw  19,871  births  in  2018.  Recent  data  shows  roughly \n0.5 percent  of  all  U.S. births  took  place  in  birthing  centers.  This  is  a \n200 percent increase over the past ten years. \n \nBirthing  centers  in  the  midwifery  model  of  care  are  associated  with  lower \ncesarean rates and improved outcomes after birth and postpartum, cost savings \nfor individuals, states and Medicaid systems, and increased client satisfaction. \nThose  choosing  to  deliver  in  birthing  centers  leave  their  births  feeling \nempowered and excited as they enter into the journey of parenthood. \n \nThe U.S. is currently ranked worst of all developed countries in regard to birth \noutcomes.  Mothers  in  the  U.S.  have  a  higher  risk  of  mortality  in  childbirth \ndespite spending more on the childbirth process. We are fifty-fifth in maternal \nmortality and two times higher than 37 other nations. We are thirty-third in \ninfant mortality with 5.8 deaths per 1,000 live births. Racial disparities make \nthis  exponentially  greater.  Nationally,  Medicaid  pays  for  almost  half  of  U.S. \nbirths. \n \nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 40 out of every \n100,000 African-American birthing persons die during childbirth. This is more \nthan three times the rate of their White peers. African Americans are three to \nfour times more likely to suffer a severe disability after childbirth in a hospital. \n \nIn addition to what appears to be a safer option for women of color, birthing \ncenters have demonstrated they are of great value. Among states reporting the \npayer on birth certificates, 42.3 percent of all U.S. births were covered by \nMedicaid.  Current  estimates  suggest  that  rate  in  Nevada  is  60  percent  to \n70 percent of births projected in the coming year will be covered by Medicaid. \nChildbirth is dominated by costly and unnecessary interventions. \n \nToday’s rate of cesarean births is almost 32 percent, which is up 50 percent \nsince 1996, and the rate of inductions has surged in recent years. \n \nA Washington, D.C., Medicaid study estimated cost savings of approximately \n$1,163 per birth using birthing centers and $11.6 million per 10,000 births. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nClark  County  issued  41,000  birth  certificates  last  year.  We  estimated \n60 percent of the Medicaid births were delivered in birthing centers, which is \nnot likely. If this were true, the potential cost savings to Nevada would be \n$28 million. Those numbers are exaggerated; nevertheless, there would be cost \nsavings to Nevada if Medicaid births were delivered in birthing centers. \n \nIf  more  pregnant  beneficiaries  accessed  birthing  centers  for  maternity  care, \nthere would be better birth outcomes, saving Medicaid funds. If an open-access \nmodel was allowed, where patients receive only prenatal care at the birthing \ncenter and then deliver in the hospital, the outcomes would be better. Many \nbirthing centers use a group pregnancy model, which allows folks to develop \ncommunity  during  the  prenatal  period.  This  encourages  breast  feeding  and \nreduces  incidents  of  postpartum  depression.  Medicaid  beneficiaries  have \nexpressed  satisfaction  with  birthing  center  care;  however,  nationally,  only  a \nsmall number of Medicaid beneficiaries are able to access this model for their \nbirths. State regulations, like the ones we are seeking to change today, can lead \nto that limitation. \n \nBirthing centers have been identified in research that looks at the Strong Start \nmodels  of  prenatal  care  as  an  ideal  model  for  promoting  social  support  for \nparents in the early days of pregnancy. Midwifery model of care as delivery in \nbirthing  centers  promotes  the  integration  of  family  and  community  in  the \npregnancy and birthing process, and group prenatal care has been found to \nimprove outcomes for birthing persons. \n \nWhen looking at the Strong Start data on the birthing center midwifery model of \ncare versus national data, we see the American Association of Birth Centers \n(AABC) data shows better outcomes, reducing the incidence of preterm birth, \nlow birth weight, very low birth weight, primary cesarean and total cesarean \nbirths including repeat cesareans. \n \nAs  it  relates  to  race  and  the  Black  maternal  health  crisis,  the  AABC  data \nsuggests  that  for  African-American  birthing  persons,  the  disparities  were \ndiminished, particularly the reduction in cesarean births and low birth weight \nbabies using the birthing center and midwifery model of care. \n \nBirthing center prenatal care is time-intensive and relationship-based. Midwives \nsee fewer clients per day, allowing them to spend more time with the patients \nthey support. This model has been incentivized because of these relationships, \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nand access to resources and support systems result in better outcomes and cost \nsavings to Medicaid. This leads to an increase in body-fed babies, lower rates of \ncesarean, perinatal and postpartum interventions. \n \nThat concludes the testimony on my presentation on birthing centers. I would \nnow like to share a personal story with you. \n \nAfter becoming pregnant, I read and learned about the Black maternal health \ncrisis, learned about high-profile Black women’s difficulty with pregnancy and \nworried about entering the medical system. Serena Williams almost died when \nshe found herself in the hospital with doctors who did not believe her. \n \nI lost that pregnancy after receiving care from a medical provider that was so \negregious,  that  when  reported,  I  received  a  refund  of  all  copays  from  my \ninsurance  provider  in  addition  to  a  letter  of  apology.  When  I  found  myself \npregnant with my oldest daughter, hospital care did not feel safe for me. I did \nnot feel a home birth was a good fit for myself and my family. \n \nAt my first prenatal appointment, my obstetrician told me everything was fine \nand that I was at a 10 percent to 15 percent chance of miscarrying. The next \nday I met with a midwife at a birthing center who said I was doing fine and \nlooking at an 85 percent to 90 percent chance of having a healthy baby. For \nme, it was the emphasis on the health and survival of my baby that empowered \nme to have the best pregnancy possible and made birthing centers a great fit for \nme. At the time, I was living in Colorado and was able to delivery in a birthing \ncenter. \n \nUpon  learning  this  was  not  an  option  for  my  friends  in  Nevada,  I  became \npassionate about promoting equity and access for everyone to have the births \nof their dreams. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN MONROE-MORENO: \nThere are continued conversations between the sponsors and the Department of \nHealth and Human Services (DHHS) about a proposed amendment (Exhibit C). \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nHow many states have certified birthing centers in place? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nGENEVIEVE BURKETT (Director of Nursing, Serenity Birth Center): \nI do not have a nationwide number. \n \nDR. RAINES: \nAt  this  time,  there  are  37  states  with  freestanding  birthing  centers  and \nregulations.  The  vast  majority  of  these  states  use  the  Commission  for  the \nAccreditation of Birth Centers (CABC) guidelines for licensure and regulation. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nAre there requirements for relationships with hospitals in case of emergencies at \na birthing center? The bill references a 30-mile distance allowed, which is a long \nway when someone is in distress. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN MONROE-MORENO: \nYou will hear opposition on the 30-mile distance. When creating the language \nfor the bill, we heard from our rural communities that do not have hospitals, \nwhich  is  the  reason  we  chose  the  30-mile  distance.  In  some  of  our  urban \ncommunities, the nearest hospital is within 10 to 15 miles. The 30-mile distance \nwas added to the bill so there would be some type of medical facility in our rural \ncommunities. \n \nMS. BURKETT: \nWe are required by the State to develop a collaborating transfer relationship \nwith our closest hospital. For us, it is University Medical Center in Las Vegas. \nWe sent a certified letter requesting that relationship, and the center has not \nresponded. The center must receive our patients, and we have a great working \nrelationship  with  the  labor  and  delivery  and  Neonatal  Intensive  Care  Unit \ndepartments. \n \nOur  transfer  rate  is  about  12  percent  of  our  clients.  Perhaps  1  percent  to \n2 percent of those clients are emergent. The remaining are those with prolonged \nlabor or mothers who would like an epidural and would want to transfer. Every \nprenatal  visit  admission  to  the  birthing  center  requires  a  risk  assessment \nfollowing State recommendations for women who risk out of birthing-center \ncare as they must be low risk. We have gone above that and are in line with the \nCABC for the accreditation of birthing centers to ensure the women we care for \nare appropriate for our level of care. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nDR. RAINES: \nThere are those not as excited as we are about this model of empowering and \npromoting equity for birthing persons. For that reason, it was stated that an \nattempt must be made to establish a relationship with a hospital. Requiring the \nrelationship  would  be  prohibitive  and  prevent  people  from  opening  birthing \ncenters  since  that  would  put  owners  and  operators  at  the  mercy  of  the \nhospitals. \n \nSafety is the No. 1 component of this work. There are folks who risk out of \nbirthing centers long before they get to the end of their pregnancy or toward the \nend of their term. Do not think of it as a transfer in the heat of the moment, but \nit includes transfer at 36 weeks because of unregulated blood pressure, or at \n32 weeks  because  an  anomaly  has  been  discovered.  Those  transfers  occur \nbefore labor and delivery. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe mothers giving birth in birthing centers are healthy, have had prenatal care \nand are set up for a successful, healthy outcome. Does the data you cited \ncompare to the broader population of births or those who meet the same criteria \nof those giving birth in a birthing center? \n \nDR. RAINES: \nPart of what makes these mothers healthy and ready for a successful birth is \nthe prenatal care they receive in the birthing center. My first visit included a \nnutrition class focusing on what I should be eating to keep my baby healthy and \nrecourses to find the healthy food. It becomes apples to apples in that the \nmodel of care looks different in a hospital. The data is looking at a general \npopulation of those who went through birthing centers. Everyone does not start \nat a birthing center working out and physically fit; it is the same for those \nstarting their prenatal care at a hospital. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN MONROE-MORENO: \nMy oldest daughter planned her first birth with the service of a midwife and \nhome birth in a pool. I was able to be there and experience the birth while \nremembering giving birth to her. I was in labor when my car broke down on the \nside  of  the  road  between  Arizona  and  California,  taken  by  ambulance  to  a \nhospital and had no one there with me. My doctor had told me I was having \nfalse labor and it was fine for me to travel. I almost died giving birth to my \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \ndaughter because the medical professional in charge at the hospital did not \nbelieve the situation I was in. \n \nMy daughter knew about that and decided to do something different. She had \nmore visits with her midwife than I had with my doctors during any of my \npregnancies.  Her  midwife  advised  her  she  would  gain  weight  during  her \npregnancy and provided her with healthy eating information and an exercise \nroutine. The day my granddaughter was born, my daughter had her midwife, an \nRN in training to be a midwife, a midwife assistant and her best friend present. \nIt was the most relaxing birth I have been a part of. \n \nThey embraced the entire family and spent time to get to know her where \noftentimes our doctors do not have the time to do this. Her midwife also made \nher preregister at the hospital and build a relationship with the doctor so that if \nsomething were to go wrong, they would have that easy transfer. She had that \noption so many of our mothers do not have. \n \nAMBER FALGOUT (Battle Born Progress): \nBattle Born Progress supports A.B. 287. This bill prioritizes women and their \noptions for giving birth in Nevada. As a mother, I recognize the importance of \nchoosing the birthing plan that is right for you and your family. There are much \nbetter outcomes for newborns and mothers when mothers are given a choice in \nhow to set up the birthing plan that works best for them. \n \nAssembly Bill 287 will help make birthing centers a viable option for mothers \nand their babies. \n \nJIMMY LAU (Dignity Health-St. Rose Dominican): \nDignity  Health  submitted  a  letter  (Exhibit  D)  from  G.  Rodney  Buzzas,  Chief \nMedical  Officer,  which  outlines  our  concerns.  The  first  one  is  the  distance \nrequired  from  the  birthing  center  to  the  hospital.  Thirty  miles  is  too  far, \nfive miles would be a better alternative. \n \nWe  are  concerned  about  the  lack  of  a  qualified  provider  for  a  higher-level \nintervention that may be necessary during birth. Intubating an infant is generally \na difficult task that would require a qualified provider. \n \nThe birthing center should have a bona fide relationship with a hospital for \nneeded transfers. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nLYNN CHAPMAN (Nevada Families for Freedom): \nThe Nevada Families for Freedom opposes a portion of A.B. 287. I will read \nfrom my written testimony (Exhibit E) in opposition. \n \nBOB RUSSO: \nI oppose changing the wording on the birth certificate where A.B. 287 refers to \nmothers as the person giving birth and fathers as the other persons. I fail to \nunderstand the reason for this change. We are here because of our biological \nmothers and fathers—to think otherwise is delusional. I grew up in an American \nItalian household where family is everything; mother, father, aunt, uncle and \ncousins. Each had their part to play in the family dynamic. I see the language \nadopted  in  the  bill  as  another  step  toward  undermining  the  family,  another \nattempt to minimize the family unit which is the basis and foundation upon \nwhich a civil society exists. In many parts of the Country, fathers are absent \nfrom the lives of young adolescents. If you want to reduce crime, strengthen \nthe family and improve the education of our children. \n \nThe thought of referring to my father as the other person is nauseating, even if \njust on the birth certificate. It is distasteful to my mother, who will be 97 years \nold  later  this  month,  to  refer  to  her  as  the  person  giving  birth.  Where  are \npeople’s rights to be called mothers and fathers on record and to be proud of \nthat fact? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN MONROE-MORENO: \nI appreciate the comments from Dignity Health. I drove from my house to the \nhospitals near me and there is not a hospital within five miles of my urban \nhome, which makes five miles unreasonable. \n \nPregnant  people  cannot  utilize  a  birthing  center  if  they  are  experiencing  a \nhigh-level  birth.  Mothers  are  monitored  throughout  the  course  of  their \npregnancy,  and  if  for  any  reason  a  mother  should  be  in  a  better  place  for \ndelivery, the mother is transferred to the hospital early in the pregnancy. \n \nThe birthing center in Las Vegas has tried to build a relationship with University \nMedical Center, and the hospital has not been amenable. I would encourage, \nwelcome and applaud hospitals working with birthing centers to build those \nrelationships. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nThe world we live in has changed. I am adopted and have been looking for my \nbirth mother and father for a number of years. I wanted to find out who they \nwere for health reasons and to thank them for the choices they made. My \nparents are on my birth certificate, but my daughter and her wife are not a \nmother and father. This is the reason for the gender-neutral language in the bill. \nWhen hospitals make comments that there are better outcomes with births in \nhospitals, while I appreciate their opinions, the data does not support this. \n \nDR. RAINES: \nThe  opposition  stated  infant  intubation  cannot  happen  at  birthing  centers.  I \nwould like to clarify that midwives are trained in infant intubation. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 287 and open the hearing on A.B. 326. \n \nASSEMBLY  BILL  326  (2nd  Reprint):  Revises  provisions  governing  cannabis. \n(BDR 56-641) \n \nASSEMBLYMAN TOM ROBERTS (Assembly District No. 13): \nToday I will be presenting A.B. 326 which revises the provisions governing \ncannabis. I will also be covering the proposed amendment (Exhibit F). \n \nThere are 36 states that have legalized medical marijuana and 15 states that \nhave regulated adult use cannabis programs. Despite this, there is a thriving \nillegal market for marijuana and the reason is simple economics. Last April, the \nLas Vegas  Metropolitan  Police  Department  announced  its  largest  indoor \nmarijuana grow operation bust of over 5,700 individual plants weighing more \nthan 860 pounds valued at nearly $9 million. \n \nThere are consequences to the black market. Unlicensed cannabis producers \nand retailers compete against legal dispensaries with lower tax collection and \nimpact to State revenue. In fiscal year 2019-2020, State sales tax on cannabis \nproducts  amounted  to  $53  million.  The  illegal  operation  I  mentioned  was \nproducing close to $20 million a year tax-free. In addition, there is violent crime \nassociated with the illicit black market. \n \nMarijuana industry owners complain about how the black market continues to \nthrive in Las Vegas. From my time at the police department, we saw a decline in \njury appeal for marijuana cases on the criminal side because it is now legal in \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nNevada. I talked to prosecutors in the high-density drug trafficking section in the \nDistrict Attorney’s Office who highlighted things I had already known. Although \nwe  were  getting  some  criminal  prosecution,  it  was  not  as  much  as  it  was \npreviously. They focused on going after those with violent priors, and many \ncases were not being prosecuted. As a result, law enforcement did not have an \nappetite to police this. \n \nOne  prosecutor  recommended  I  contact  the  State  Contractors’  Board.  The \ngentleman  who  runs  the  enforcement  division  happens  to  be  an  ex-drug \nenforcement agent supervisor. He said they have civil infractions that go along \nwith their criminal infractions, one of which goes after advertisers. You must \nadvertise  a  specific  way,  and  if  this  is  not  done,  the  Board  can  go  after \nadvertisers criminally and civilly; however, this bill only applies to civil penalties. \nIf you conduct contracting business without a license, the Board has the ability \nto fine you. That money goes into the education program to educate the public \non licensed and unlicensed contractors. It also helps support the enforcement \neffort. \n \nI took NRS 624.720 and NRS 624.700 and drafted A.B. 326. This bill mirrors \nthose  statues  providing  civil  infractions  that  would  give  law  and  code \nenforcement, the people trying to regulate the unregulated market, a tool other \nthan criminal prosecution to those operating a business without a license and/or \nunlawful advertising. \n \nSection  1.5,  subsection  1  defines  the  civil  penalty  action  to  be  taken  and \nprovides the money collected for the fine will be deposited into the city or \ncounty treasury. The district or city attorney will manage those violations. \n \nSection 2, subsection 11, paragraph (f) added language to allow the Cannabis \nBoard to regulate advertising. The Board will work with the industry so as not to \nbe burdensome, allowing consumers to know it is a legitimate business they are \nordering from. \n \nIn section 1.5, we left out the word advertise. I will be seeking an amendment \nto add that back in. \n \nWe  had  people  asking  for  cleanup  language  on  receivership  for  these \nbusinesses.  We  amended  the  bill  on  the  Assembly  Floor  but  did  not  get \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \neverything  into  the  bill  we  needed,  which  is  the  reason  for  the  proposed \namendment, Exhibit F. \n \nJOHN SANDE, IV (United Asset Management Services): \nUnited  Asset  Management  Services  is  the  first  court-appointed  receiver  to \noperate  in  the  cannabis  industry.  There  may  have  been  one  prior  to  us  in \nWashington. Receiverships are important when a business falls on hard times or \ncreditors feel a business is not being run as it should. We have bankruptcy to \nprotect business and creditors. In our instance, the business filed for bankruptcy \nprotection and was rejected because under federal law cannabis is an illegal \nsubstance.  The  bankruptcy  court  felt  the  federal  protections  for  those \nbusinesses did not apply to those types of businesses. The case was pushed to \nState court, which granted a receivership. As a result, we realized there were \nno laws that addressed this situation. \n \nIn  working  with  the  Office  of  the  Attorney  General  and  the  Cannabis \nCompliance Board (CCB), we put together language giving the CCB the authority \nto  establish  qualifications  for  receiverships.  The  minimum  qualifications  you \nwould expect a receiver to have is to fix the situation as a bankruptcy trustee \nmight  do.  The  amendment,  Exhibit  F,  gives  flexibility  to  the  CCB.  The  bill \noriginally stated they “shall” adopt regulations that establish those sections put \ninto the bill. The amendment changes the wording to “may” adopt regulations \nand gives the CCB discretion, which the CCB felt would be the best. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nUnder what process is an individual found to be liable for a violation? Who \nmakes the determination on appeal rights for that person? \n \nASSEMBLYMAN ROBERTS: \nThe premise was to give the local courts jurisdiction. For instance, in the City of \nHenderson, it could be police officers or code enforcement who would issue a \ncivil citation to those engaged in the actions highlighted in the bill and then go \nthrough the normal civil process. The original idea was to give the jurisdiction to \nthe CCB Board; however, the Board lacks the civil attorneys and/or processes at \nthis time, which is why we went with the local courts. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nAre there time limits for how long an establishment can be in receivership? Is \nthere anything prohibiting a receiver from taking over full ownership? \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nMR. SANDE, IV: \nReceivership is an equitable remedy of the court. The court presides over the \nreceivership estate, and everything must be approved through the receivership. \nAt this point in our case, the receiver has inventoried the assets, established \nrelationships with cultivators and brought the company to a position where it \ncould be transferred and sold to allow the creditors and employees who were \nowed back pay to recoup some of their money. That is in the process of being \napproved by the court. If the court wanted to establish limitations, it would \nhave the discretion under its equitable powers to do so. \n \nI am not aware of anything in the law that would require a certain period of \ntime. The complexity of the business would determine how difficult of a case it \nwould be to reestablish the business or what would need to happen in the best \ninterest of the creditors and the receivership. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nAt  the  court’s  discretion,  you  move  out  of  receivership  and  into  a  new \nownership structure. Are there opportunities for the receiver to convert into full \nownership, or is a receivership a temporary management contract? \n \nMR. SANDE, IV: \nI  am  not  aware  that  a  receivership  would  become  a  full-time  owner.  The \nreceiver is awarded and acts on behalf of the court. Typically, receiverships act \nsimilar to a trustee in bankruptcy where its job is to act on behalf of the court to \nreestablish the business and protect the assets in an organized fashion so they \ncan be transferred or liquidated. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThere are licenses and permits for an establishment. Does the receiver run the \nbusiness so it does not go down in value while waiting for someone to take \nover? \n \nMR. SANDE, IV: \nIn most cases, it would work that way. For our example, the language would \ncreate a new agent card for receivership designation. The receiver has to obtain \nits own registered agent card and have the background check the CCB required \nof it to step in and operate the business. His charge from the court was to \nreestablish the business and protect the assets to the extent possible. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIf I was a receiver and wanted to keep the profits, is there a time limit on \ngetting money back? \n \nMR. SANDE, IV: \nThe receiver does not get to keep profits, they are putting them back into the \nbusiness. They are able to charge an hourly fee, and those fees are reviewed by \nthe court for reasonableness. The creditors have an opportunity to file protests \nif they feel anything is unreasonable, and the judge would be the person signing \noff on whether the fees were reasonable. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nAre these transactions cash-heavy? \n \nMR. SANDE, IV: \nMarijuana  is  in  large  part  a  cash-heavy  business.  In  most  instances,  it  is \ncompletely cash. There are some financial institutions that do accept debit cards \nand other financial arrangements some of the cannabis companies have. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nI do not see discussion about how the $50,000 fine should be assessed. Is it \nbased  on  quantity  or  number  of  violations?  What  factors  are  taken  into \nconsideration to determine whether the fine is zero or up to $50,000? \n \nASSEMBLYMAN ROBERTS: \nWe modeled this after the language of the State Contractors’ Board. The Board \nbases it on the number of violations, size of the company and so on. Those are \nall factors taken into account by the hearing officer or judge. In that statute, it \nis silent and leaves discretion to those presiding over the hearings. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nIn the Board example, it is the Board that issues the fine, correct? We have the \ndistrict attorney or city attorney issuing the fine. \n \nASSEMBLYMAN ROBERTS: \nThat is correct. It would be code enforcement and/or a business licensing entity \nthat manages those businesses in those districts in concert with the city or \ndistrict attorney. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nMIKE CATHCART (City of Henderson): \nThe City of Henderson supports A.B. 326. Having another option to stop the \nillegal sale of cannabis is welcomed and helps lower the level of black market \nproduct competing with the well-regulated legal cannabis industry. \n \nCHAD CHRISTENSEN: \nI am part owner of Pisos Dispensary in Clark County. California has had up to \n70 percent of the market of cannabis consumed illegally. If we considered that \nfact, the cannabis market may be the second-largest taxpayer in Nevada. We \nhave two concerns; one is public health and the other is revenue to the State. \n \nBlack  market  or  illegal  cannabis  is  not  tested,  and  the  Legislature  ensures \nNevada has the most robust testing system to protect patients, consumers and \nvisitors to our State. If someone assumes they are buying a legal product which \nis not legal and is detrimental to their health, it becomes bad national press. \n \nWe need to ensure the revenue from the sale of cannabis goes to the State, the \nschools and the programs we are working hard to fund. Imagine we cut the \nillegal  number  in  half  in  Nevada  to  35  percent;  that  would  be  a  significant \namount going to the State. This bill is a step in that direction. \n \nLAYKE MARTIN (Nevada Dispensary Association): \nThe  Nevada  Dispensary  Association  supports  A.B.  326.  We  want  to  thank \nAssemblyman  Roberts  for  providing  additional  tools  to  combat  dealers  who \nmarket to organized crime. We are grateful for the flexibility to work with the \nindustry to ensure required identification on advertising would not be a burden \nsince  the  industry  will  help  consumers  distinguish  ads  for  licensed  versus \nunlicensed  businesses.  We  support  the  amendment  language  to  establish  a \nprocess for receivership. As federal bankruptcy protection is not an option for \ncannabis businesses, statutory language and CCB regulations will help provide \nguidance  for  insolvent  businesses  and  receiverships  within  the  cannabis \nindustry. \n \nASSEMBLYMAN ROBERTS: \nThis  was  a  work  in  progress  as  it  came  out  of  drafting,  and  a  number  of \nchanges were made. We will make additional changes and are agreeable to any \nthe  Committee  may  have.  My  objective  is  to  give  people  a  tool  to  lead \nunsuspecting tourists away from sites such as Weedmaps who skirt legitimate \nbusinesses in Nevada. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 326 and open the hearing on A.B. 374. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 374 (1st Reprint): Establishes the Statewide Substance Use \nResponse Working Group. (BDR 40-991) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN JILL TOLLES (Assembly District No. 25): \nI am here today to present A.B. 374. In November of last year, the National \nDrug Helpline placed Nevada as one of 28 states on red alert for increased risk \nof death from overdoses of opioids and other drugs. The Covid-19 pandemic \nhas amplified the existing opioid crisis. According to DHHS, Nevada has seen a \n50 percent increase in opioid and fentanyl-involved drug overdose deaths since \nthe onset of the pandemic. \n \nThe  National  Safety  Council  reports  overdoses  kill  more  of  us  than  breast \ncancer, guns and car crashes combined. Our family was impacted by this crisis \nwhen one of our family members developed a dependency to pain medications \nafter an accident at work. This led to dependency on street drugs and tragically \nended with an overdose just before Christmas 2007. \n \nIn  2017,  626  Nevadans  lost  their  lives,  impacting  countless  brothers  and \nsisters,  mothers  and  fathers,  children,  spouses  and  friends.  Addiction  is \ntreatable and preventable. There are 23 million people in recovery in the U.S. \ntoday. Recovery is not only possible but probable if one receives the right type \nof treatment and has access to support services. \n \nAssembly Bill 374 establishes the Statewide Substance Use Response Working \nGroup  under  the  Office  of  the  Attorney  General.  After  discussions  with \nstakeholders,  there  was  a  strong  cry  to  convene  an  ongoing  Statewide \ncoordinated effort ensuring each entity is working in collaboration to identify \ngaps and employee evidence-based best practices to tackle issues of substance \nuse disorder, behavioral health and other co-occurring disorders across Nevada. \nThis bill is based on the direct input of the Attorney General, the Office of the \nAttorney General, DHHS, the National Association of Counties, Shatterproof and \nrepresentatives of the mental health and recovery, prevention and treatment \ncommunity. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nSections 5 through 7 establish the Nevada Statewide Substance Use Response \nWorking Group adding membership, service requirements and other functions of \nthe Working Group. \n \nSection 6, subsection 2, outlines the membership of the group including the \nAttorney  General  or  appointee,  the  Director  of  DHHS  or  appointee, \nrepresentatives of local governments from Washoe, Clark and rural counties, \nlaw enforcement, health care recovery treatment and prevention communities, \nand Legislators. \n \nIt  is  my  intention  to  add  an  amendment  to  the  bill  that  would  include \nrepresentation from a hospital, considering hospitals are often on the frontlines, \nparticularly in the emergency rooms, as well as K-12 representation per the \nrequest of the Clark County Education Association. \n \nSection 10 outlines the duties of the group including making recommendations \nto DHHS on the use of monies and reporting to the Governor, Attorney General, \nAdvisory Commission on the Administration of Justice and the Director of the \nLegislative Counsel Bureau. \n \nSection  10.5  requires  DHHS  submit  a  report  concerning  the  use  of  money \nreceived by the State from settlements, civil actions, gifts, grants or donations, \nand  all  other  money  spent  by  the  State  and  each  political  subdivision  for \npurposes  relating  to  substance  misuse  and  substance  use  disorders  to  the \nWorking Group annually. \n \nSection  14  states  this  legislation  will  become  effective  upon  passage  and \napproval. \n \nSTEPHANIE WOODARD, PSY.D. (Senior Advisor on Behavioral Health, Division of \nPublic and Behavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services): \nThe issues around substance use, misuse and addiction are complex and often \ninvolve an interplay between individual risk factors and environmental, social \nand economic conditions. Just as there is no one single driver contributing to \nthe rising rates of substance misuse, addiction and overdose, there is also no \none single solution. \n \nDuring the preliminary work to address the methamphetamine and opioid crises, \nit  was  clear  Nevada  needed  to  implement  strategies  that  crossed  multiple \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nsectors  including  medicine,  law  enforcement,  prevention,  public  health,  and \naddiction treatment and recovery services. Such efforts led to the creation of \nthe  previous  Attorney  General’s  Substance  Abuse  Working  Group  and  the \nsunsetted  Governor’s  Opioid  Accountability  Task  Force  meetings  where \nstakeholders engaged in data-driven discussions, supported needed policy and \nprogram development and implementation, reduced duplication of efforts and \nbrought accountability and transparency to the process. \n \nThis  intentional  work  across  systems  has  led  to  coordinated  strategies  to \naddress  the  crises  at  hand.  As  Nevada  faces  new  challenges  related  to \nsubstance use addiction and overdose, we have seen it is not sufficient to \nestablish groups to singularly focus on one issue or substance at a time. We \nneed a comprehensive and collaborative approach. \n \nThe proposed Statewide Substance Response Working Group in A.B. 374 brings \nstakeholders together to develop comprehensive, evidence-based strategies and \nrecommendations for preventions, early intervention, treatment, recovery, harm \nreduction, data sharing, criminal justice intervention and public policy. The focus \nof  the  Working  Group  will  leverage  and  expand  current  efforts  across \ndepartments and agencies to prevent and reduce substance use and enhance \nefforts through coordination and collaboration. It will introduce evidence-based \nprevention  and  intervention  efforts  to  significantly  reduce  the  burden  of \nsubstance use.  \n \nRecommendations from the Working Group will include primary, secondary and \ntertiary prevention, access to harm reduction intervention services and overdose \nprevention strategies. This group will assess and evaluate existing pathways to \ntreatment  and  recovery.  It  will  work  to  understand  how  Nevadans  access \ntreatment and recovery support services from various points for individuals who \ninterface with law enforcement or the criminal justice system. There will be a \nspecific emphasis on deflection and diversion from the criminal justice system. \n \nThis  Group  will  also  work  to  improve  and  expand  evidence-based  or \nevidence-informed practices, procedures, and strategies for the treatment and \nsupport  of  individuals  in  recovery  as  well  as  specific  recommendations  for \nspecial populations. \n \nThe Working Group will support systems and programs for persons in recovery \nand  recommend  processes  and  regulations  to  ensure  medications  including \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nopioids  and  other  controlled  substances  are  prescribed  appropriately  and  in \naccordance  with  existing  NRS.  The  Group  will  examine  qualitative  and \nquantitative data to understand the risk factors contributing to substance use \nand  the  rates  of  substance  use  and  addiction  in  Nevada,  including  across \ndiverse  and  special  populations.  The  Group  will  develop  strategies  and \nimplementation plans to prevent and respond to overdose, set the efficacy and \nexpand  implementations  of  programs  to  educate  youth  and  families  about \nsubstance use and reduce harm associated with drug use. \n \nThis  Group  will  improve  coordination  between  local,  State,  federal  law \nenforcement agencies and public health entities to enhance the communication \nof timely and relevant information and data. It will also evaluate current systems \nfor sharing information between departments and agencies for the trafficking \nand  distribution  of  licit  and  illicit  substances.  It  will  study  the  effects  of \nsubstance abuse on the criminal justice system, the methods and resources to \nprevent  the  manufacture,  trafficking  and  sale  of  substances,  and  the \neffectiveness of criminal and civil penalties, ultimately evaluating the impact of \nsubstance use disorders on the economy. \n \nThis Group will work to study, evaluate and provide recommendations toward \nthe opioid settlement litigation funds the State will receive through the Office of \nthe Attorney General. \n \nIn the absence of these formal convening groups, we have worked diligently to \nbring partners and invested stakeholders together to have these conversations, \ncontinuing to use the momentum developed in previous working groups, which \nhas proven to be a challenge. Having a formal convening group to bring the \nnecessary individuals together to do this important work will help Nevada make \nthe necessary progress in addressing substance use. \n \nCHRISTINE  JONES  BRADY  (Second  Assistant  Attorney  General,  Office  of  the \nAttorney General): \nThe  Office  of  the  Attorney  General  supports  A.B. 374  and  is  thankful  to \nAssemblywoman Tolles for this bipartisan bill. Drug abuse and addiction knows \nno boundaries or parties. Who has not been personally impacted by problematic \nsubstance use or addiction? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nThe Office of the Attorney General will support this endeavor and the Substance \nUse Response Group by providing meeting space and ensuring public meetings \ncomply with open meeting laws. \n \nThis Working Group consists of a diverse and dynamic group of professionals \nand citizens who will work hard to combat this Statewide problem. \n \nSARAH ADLER (Vitality Unlimited; New Frontier Treatment Center): \nMy colleague Helen Foley had to leave so I will present her testimony in support \nof A.B. 374 from FirstMed Health and Wellness Center. In addition to traditional \nmedical care, we provide mental health and substance addiction services to \napproximately 1,200 patients monthly. While we are proud of the services we \nprovide, there are many roadblocks to quality care. A strong working group can \nhelp alleviate some of these problems to streamline the process and provide \ngreater  access  with  better  outcomes  to  low-income  and  underserved \npopulations. \n \nSome  opportunities  include  providing  reimbursement  for  supportive  services, \nsuch  as  case  management  for  patients  with  substance  use  disorders,  and \nallowing  group  therapy  and  peer  support  for  medication-assisted  treatment \nprograms removing the barrier for dispensing suboxone for medication-assisted \ntreatment-certified providers. The program should also pay for the initial phase \nof suboxone induction to prevent barriers to initiating care. \n \nMany children and families come as a referral from schools, the Department of \nChild and Family Services, and the juvenile justice system. Because we connect \nour patients to external resources and have a robust group of providers, we are \nable to give a perspective of the lower-income patients generally affected by \nsubstance  use.  We  would  like  a  seat  at  the  table  or  to  join  an  advisory \ncommittee as the Working Group moves forward on this critical issue. \n \nI will now give testimony for Vitality Unlimited and New Frontier Treatment \nCenter supporting A.B. 374. \n \nAddressing  substance  use  disorders  requires  active  work  in  prevention, \nresidential  treatment  and  community-based  care  to  support  recovery.  The \nSubstance Use Disorder Working Group proposal uses recognition of State and \nlocal entities throughout its language. We would like to cast a light on rural, \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nfrontier, tribal and diverse communities and populations as specific communities \nwe are confident will be addressed by this Working Group. \n \nThere  is  a  need  to  look  at  workforce  development.  The  Legislature  has \naddressed the need for developing the behavioral health workforce. There is \nspecific  need  related  to  licensed  alcohol  and  drug  counselors  and  licensed \nclinical alcohol and drug counselors. In Nevada, stigma is falling away from \nmental illness. We have developed many licensed professions that work with \nmental illness but are falling behind in our licensing of the alcohol and drug \nworkforce. \n \nWe appreciate the support for Senate Bill (S.B.) 181, which removes one of the \nbarriers mentioned earlier, and encourage the work of Assemblywoman Tolles \nand this bill to look at workforce development. \n \nSENATE BILL 181 (1st Reprint): Revises provisions relating to alcohol and drug \ncounselors. (BDR 54-558) \n \nGEORGE A. ROSS (Hospital Corporation of America): \nHospital Corporation of America supports A.B. 374. All too often, hospitals see \nthe unfortunate results of substance addiction and treat this issue every day. \nThis bill is an impressive approach to helping address this problem by putting a \ngroup of people together that has been well chosen and blends into how the \nState works and how the group will meet and be supported. \n \nMR. LAU: \nDignity Health-St. Rose Dominican supports A.B. 374. Hospitals are in a unique \nposition in this nexus, largely because hospitals encounter people who may not \nhave access to other healthcare options. An example would be a person who \nmay not have a primary care provider ending up in an emergency room. At that \npoint, hospitals have the ability to intervene and take steps to get that person \ninto care. Dignity Health participates in this through various programs including \nits Empowered Program which focuses on pregnant women. \n \nCOURTNEY HUNTER (Shatterproof): \nShatterproof is a national nonprofit dedicated to reversing the addiction crisis \nand supports A.B. 374 for its impact on substance use and addiction in Nevada. \nAt Shatterproof, we are focused on evidence-based solutions to ending this \ncrisis. Having a stakeholder working group reviewing the data, assessing the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nevidence and making informed solutions based on that evidence is a critical step \nforward, ultimately saving lives. A number of our core programs include looking \nat and assessing treatment quality, advancing behavioral health and integrating \nit into primary care settings. \n \nWe worked with Johns Hopkins University to provide guiding principles around \nhow  states  are  spending  opioid  settlement  dollars.  One  of  the  principles  is \nspending money to save lives. That means having dedicated funds making sure \nwe are replacing dollars. Another principle is focusing on racial equity. We are \naccomplishing  that  through  this  stakeholder  advisory  group  pulling  together \ndifferent types of community stakeholders to have a voice and seat at the table. \nIf we not are alive, we cannot recover. \n \nThe final principle is transparency. Having the reporting mechanism within this \ngroup is an asset, providing a transparent record for the State and the Country. \n \nKELSEY MATTHEWS (Shatterproof): \nI  am  23  years  old  and  a  Shatterproof  Ambassador,  the  national  nonprofit \ndedicated to reversing the addiction and overdose crisis. I am the founder of \nTreasuring Tracey, an addiction and overdose platform created in memory of my \nmother who passed away of an accidental drug overdose in 2016. \n \nI have been blessed to have worked with many organizations in Las Vegas, \nincluding  Teen  Challenge.  I  serve  on  the  Board  of  Directors  at  Hope \nCompassionate  Healthcare,  a  nonprofit  organization  founded  to  provide \ncomprehensive and integrated health care and filling the gaps in our healthcare \nsystem. \n \nPersonal life experiences have inspired me to join the fight against the addiction \ncrisis and to pursue social work and a law degree to make an impact on the \nlives of others. Addiction is a family disease. The entire family unit suffers, \nwhich I can attest to firsthand. As a child, I was parentified over my mother and \nher struggle with addiction and functioned as one of her primary caretakers \nalongside my grandparents. This continued until her death in 2016 when I was \n17 years old. I have seen things no child should see—witnessing my mother \nrepeatedly overdose, finding myself at the hands of drug dealers and countless \nunimaginable things including being born addicted to cocaine. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \nPeople  are  dying,  families  are  broken  and  children  are  losing  their  parents. \nParents are burying their children. The crisis is a pandemic in and of itself. We \nneed to get to the root of the problem in all its forms. \n \nLooking back, I can see gaps in the system that exist today. There were times \nmy mother looked for help and there was a severe lack of resources available to \nher  for  receiving  adequate  treatment  from  medical  and  mental  health \nprofessionals.  She  was  stigmatized  and  denied  care  due  to  insurance  and \nfinancial reasons or providers being understaffed and unprepared. This is a sad \nreality in our communities. \n \nThe creation of the Statewide task force is necessary in the fight against this \ncrisis. To be successful will take a team effort. We need a diverse team of \npeople  from  all  different  backgrounds  who  possess  lived  experience  with \nsubstance abuse disorders. Getting to the root of the crisis is going to require \nmany  things,  including  promoting  and  providing  adequate  and  specialized \nbehavioral  health  treatment  and  counseling.  We  need  to  ensure  we  have \nproperly educated medical professionals and care providers with wraparound \nresources available to support families; work to reduce the stigma attached to \nsubstance use; and ensure patients seeking care are treated fairly and with \ncompassion. \n \nBy creating a Statewide task force, we are giving people a chance to have their \nvoices heard while coming together to be a part of the solution. In a time where \ndivision is running rampant, we need to stand united and work together to make \na change in our communities. \n \nI made my mother a promise that I would not allow her death to be in vain and \none day I would use her story, our story, to make a difference. \n \nBRENDA PEARSON, PH.D. (Clark County Education Association): \nThe Clark County Education Association (CCEA) supports A.B. 374 as amended. \nAt the beginning of the pandemic, we realized stay-at-home orders were going \nto open up the potential for increased substance abuse. We must look at how \nwe can work together as a community to put people and students in recovery \ntogether as we address substance abuse and overdose with our mental and \nbehavioral professionals, wraparound services and programs preventing opioids \non campus. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \nThis  Working  Group  will  address  substance  abuse  in  our  education  system \nthrough the addition of a representative of K-12 education. Additionally, we \nhave  the  opportunity  to  discuss  and  implement  best  practices  leading  to \nproactive support to address this issue. Clark County’s Mission High School, the \nfirst  comprehensive  secondary  school  designed  for  students  recovering  from \nsubstance abuse, use and/or dependency, has brought hope and support to \nstudents in need. By adding K-12 to this Working Group, we can look at the \nsuccesses of Mission High School and distribute health and human service and \npublic outreach across the State to replicate the program. \n \nAs educators, we must do everything in our power to put our student’s health \nfirst. The CCEA looks forward to supporting the development of this Working \nGroup. \n \nDAGNY STAPLETON (Nevada Association of Counties): \nThe  Nevada  Association  of  Counties  supports  A.B.  374.  We  appreciate  the \ninclusion of county human services representatives and county law enforcement \nto the Working Group. There is an important nexus between the opioid crisis \nand many of the services counties provide including emergency response and \nhuman services. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN TOLLES: \nThis is meaningful legislation for myself and so many others. I will offer an \namendment and open the invitation for anyone else to join as a cosponsor. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 374 and open the hearing on A.B. 278. \n \nASSEMBLY  BILL  278  (1st  Reprint):  Provides  for  the  collection  of  certain \ninformation from physicians. (BDR 54-771) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN BEA DURAN (Assembly District No. 11): \nI am here today to present A.B. 278 and will read from my written testimony \n(Exhibit G). \n \nMAYA HOLMES (Health Care Research Manager, Culinary Health Fund): \nNevada has one of the largest physician shortage areas in the U.S.; we are \nforty-fifth in the Nation in providers per capita and fiftieth for primary providers. \nNevada ranks forty-eighth in the Country for clinical care, forty-fourth for access \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \nto  care,  forty-second  due  to  adults  avoiding  care  because  of  cost  and \nforty-seventh in the Nation for quality of care. \n \nLittle is known about the specific market forces that may impact the physician \nshortage, access to affordability and quality, including basic information such as \nwho owns or has purchased a physician practice in the State. Ownership of \nphysician practices has changed dramatically over the last decade. In 2019, the \nAmerican Medical Association announced that more physicians were employed \nthan were independent for the first time. This is from national data based on \nperiodic surveys. We do not have a comprehensive picture of our State that \ndemonstrates trends in Nevada’s healthcare market. \n \nSome  reports  indicate  hospitals  now  employ  physicians  who  have  been  in \nprivate practice because of increasing overhead, reimbursement issues and the \nadministrative responsibilities of ownership. The employment status of doctors \nmay affect patient access. One study found employed physicians typically see \nfewer patients in a day on average than private practice physicians. Physician \nemployment status can affect affordability. According to one study, hospital \nacquisitions of physicians increase physician prices an average of 14 percent, \n33.5  percent  for  cardiologists  and  20  percent  for  orthopedic  providers. \nNumerous studies have shown private equity ownership of physician practices \nleads to higher prices. \n \nPhysician ownership can also affect referral patterns. A Stanford study showed \nphysicians increased referrals to the hospitals who employed them and patients \nwere more likely to be treated at a high-cost, low-quality hospital when their \nadmitting physicians practice is owned by a hospital. \n \nAssembly Bill 278 will allow policy makers, providers, patients and payers to \nunderstand critical trends in Nevada’s healthcare market and their impact on \nphysician  volume,  entity  and  practice.  This  bill  adds  to  existing  licensing \nrenewal  and  biennial  registration  requirements,  an  internet  link  to  a  form \ndeveloped by DHHS for physicians to indicate whether a physician is employed \nor  independent,  and  if  employed,  where  the  physician  practices  and  which \nentity owns that practice. \n \nThe Board of Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine \nare to include a link to these data requests and applications for license renewal \nand biennial registration. Applicants are required to respond but not subject to \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 27 \n \ndisciplinary action or licensure or registration refusal for failure to do so. Any \nreporting  on  this  data  would  be  aggregated  to  protect  provider  privacy \nrequirements and not reveal the identity of the physician. \n \nAssembly Bill 278 requires DHHS to collect and maintain the information and \nprepare an annual report regarding physician practice and employment trends in \nNevada  and  post  the  report  on  an  internet  website  maintained  by  the \nDepartment. \n \nIt  is  critical  that  policy  makers,  public  and  private  payers,  and  patients \nunderstand the role of entities like private equity and other major players that \nare consolidating the physician market to understand consolidation impact on \naccess  to  quality  and  affordability.  Because  of  our  contracting,  we  know \nNeonatal Intensive Care Units and emergency room physician groups are now \nowned by private equity groups. We would like to see how that impacts price, \naccess and contracting status over time. Without any reporting of who owns \nthese and other practices, such trends will be impossible to evaluate. \n \nThe intent of this legislation is to add a brief data request to already required \nlicensing  registration  reporting  steps.  The  information  will  be  known  to  the \nphysician  and  will  not  add  to  the  administrative  burden.  The  information  is \nalready in the public domain but not available in an aggregated, accessible, \nmeaningful and useful way for policy makers, providers, patients and payers; \nA.B. 278 will provide that. \n \nBOBBETTE BOND (Health Care Policy Director, Culinary Health Fund): \nIn addition to the statistics you have heard today, the Journal of the American \nMedical Association has data on what has been happening with the Covid-19 \ncrisis. There have been more private equity deals happening because of the \nCovid-19 crisis. In 2020, there were over 150 private equity deals closed in the \nsecond half of the year. \n \nThere are many factors that go into quality and access to health care. Nevada is \nstruggling with this issue and physician density. We have been dramatically \nimpacted by private equity acquisitions. As Ms. Holmes stated, we see that in \nour contracts but do not have a way to look at the data all together. Our history \nwith  the  legislative  process  in  the  last  15  years  has  been  healthcare \ntransparency. We worked on hospital reporting and quality reporting, and in \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 28 \n \n2017 and 2019, we worked on prescription drug reporting. Last Session, we \nspent time with price bills, and there will be reporting coming from that. \n \nWe are one of the states that has the least amount of reporting on what is \nhappening in the healthcare market. Health care is becoming a never-ending, \nunfortunate chase to provide access to quality while managing limited dollars. \n \nOne of our solutions it to track the impact of consolidation on pricing in a way \nwe can monitor. This bill would provide a baseline without providing a lot of \nadministrative  overhead  and  without  adding  cost  to  the  system.  Physicians, \nwhen obtaining or renewing their license, provide basic information about who \nthey are employed by. Is it a hospital, a large physician group or a solo practice? \nIf so, what is the name of the practice and how many are in the group? \n \nThis would impact the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners and State \nBoard of Osteopathic Medicine. The limited information is needed for us to get a \nbaseline so we can, over time, better see the impact of what is happening in the \nhealthcare market. We realize if physicians are being licensed for the first time, \nthey may not know how many people or physicians work in their offices; they \nwould have to leave that area on the form blank. \n \nWe originally intended to add this information to the State Board application \nitself.  During  the  last  Assembly  hearing,  the  Medical  Board  proposed  an \namendment to match S.B. 379, which would allow the information from that \nsurvey to be provided in a link the Board has on its application process. This link \nis intended to provide critical information about physician density in way we will \nsee patterns. \n \nSENATE  BILL  379  (1st  Reprint):  Provides  for  the  collection  of  certain  data \nconcerning providers of health care. (BDR 40-457) \n \nThis is more demographic data, not a survey with “yes” and “no” questions. \nThere are no penalties if this information is not reported, but we are hopeful it \nwill be so we have a way to track this information. The DHHS will have a role in \nmaking both of these bills merge together. This is in response to concerns from \nSenator Hardy about having two separate surveys coming from the Board. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 29 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThere have been references to S.B. 379 we previously heard in this Committee. \nWe have checked with our legal counsel to ensure there is no conflict between \nthe two bills that would need to be remedied. We have also checked with DHHS \nbut should confirm with the Department if it can simultaneously implement the \nintent of both bills in an efficient way. \n \nMARGOT  CHAPPEL  (Deputy  Administrator,  Regulatory  and  Planning  Services, \nDivision  of  Public  and  Behavioral  Health,  Department  of  Health  and \nHuman Services): \nWe can absorb this work and the two bills combined. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRemainder of page intentionally left blank, signature page to follow.   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 30 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 278 and seeing no public comment, the meeting \nis adjourned at 5:54 p.m. \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nVickie Polzien, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 6, 2021 \nPage 31 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nBegins \nExhibit \nBill   on  Witness / Entity  Description \nLetter \nPage \n  A  1    Agenda \nAssemblywoman \nA.B. 287  B  1  Danielle  Bill Presentation \nMonroe-Moreno \nAssemblywoman \nA.B. 287  C  1  Danielle  Proposed Amendment \nMonroe-Moreno \nJimmy Lau / Dignity  Opposition Statement \nA.B. 287  D  1  Health-St. Rose  submitted by G.

COMLOSSY: \nI  will  read  the  summary  of  A.B.  181  and  the  amendments  from  the  work \nsession document (Exhibit E). \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI  have  concerns  about  healthcare  providers  when  a  situation  may  be \ndiscoverable even though it is \"confidential.\" How do we protect the person's \nidentity when it comes from an individual practice versus a hospital? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN SARAH PETERS (Assembly District No. 24): \nI appreciate the question and will pass it on to Dr. Stephanie Woodard who may \nbe more versed in the specifics of this question. \n \nSTEPHANIE WOODARD, PSY.D. (Senior Advisor on Behavioral Health, Division of \nPublic and Behavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services): \nThe intent of the legislation is that regulations will stipulate which providers we \nexpect to make these reports. We are looking for these reports primarily to \ncome from providers within hospital settings not independent practices. This \nlegislation  would  fall  under  Nevada  Revised  Statutes  (NRS)  441A  where \ncommunicable  diseases  and  highly  sensitive  data  need  the  ultimate \nconfidentiality and data protection. The data are transmitted to the Division of \nPublic and Behavioral Health and held by the Office of Analytics. \n \nKYRA MORGAN (Chief Biostatistician, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nDr. Woodard is correct. Our plan would be to utilize existing data processing \nmechanisms we have in place under NRS 441A and extend those to include \nthese data on suicide and suicide attempts. The mechanisms for confidentiality \nare completely in place, and we would hold the data as confidential. We would \nnot  release  anything  in  any  kind  of  public  setting  that  would  allow  for \nreidentification of an individual. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nDoes this only apply to hospitals or is there a provider of health care other than \na hospital that has to do this, for instance, a group practice or an individual \nperson? Are any of those captured in this or is it just hospitals? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 11, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nDR. WOODARD: \nThe intent at this time is just hospitals. The regulations we develop subsequent \nto this legislation would define that and provide further clarity. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nTo provide clarity, it is not explicitly in the bill, but the intent is to only do a \nregulatory process that would lead toward hospitals. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI will be voting no with a right to change my vote. \n \nERIC ROBBINS (Counsel): \nI am providing clarification for our drafting purposes. The bill says a provider of \nhealth care who knows of or provides services to a person who has attempted \nsuicide would be required to report in the manner prescribed by the regulations \nof the State Board of Health. The bill does not expressly provide for the Board \nto  adopt  regulations  that  designate  the  providers,  which  seems  to  be  what \nDr. Woodard  was  saying  would  happen.  I  am  wondering  if  that  should  be \nexplicitly added to the amendment. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAssemblywoman Peters, would you like that language explicitly added to the \namendment,  that  it  is  the  intent  of  the  bill  to  identify  the  providers  in  the \nregulatory process? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS: \nYes, I would appreciate that. I thought in the amendment there was language \nthat clarified facilities or providers which would then have to be defined in the \nregulatory process. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThere are two proposed amendments. \n \nMS. COMLOSSY: \nThe bill page of the work session document, item 2, requires either a provider of \nhealth care or the medical facility in which the healthcare provider works to \nreport required information related to attempted suicide. It does not relate to the \nregulatory  piece.  If  the  intent  is  to  have  the  State  Board  of  Health  adopt \nregulations identifying which types of healthcare providers or provider facilities \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 11, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nmust report this information, then we will add that as an additional amendment \non the record and we can make that happen in the next reprint. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS: \nYes, that works for everyone. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDr.  Woodard  and  Ms.  Morgan,  can  you  implement  this  based  on  this \nconversation? \n \nDR. WOODARD: \nYes, we can. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nMr. Robbins, do you have the intent for drafting the language? \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nYes. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will entertain a motion for A.B. 181. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS MOVED TO AMEND AND DO PASS AS AMENDED \nA.B. 181. \n \n  SENATOR SPEARMAN SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI will vote no, but reserve my right to change my vote during Floor Session. \n \n  THE MOTION CARRIED.

(BDR 57-\n251) \n \nMS. COMLOSSY: \nI will read the summary of S.B. 420 and the amendments from the work session \ndocument (Exhibit H). \n \nSENATOR NICOLE J. CANNIZZARO (Senatorial District No. 6): \nThe version of the conceptual amendment includes the different changes we \nmade to clarify some aspects of the Public Option concerning Medicaid or better \nreimbursements, and who would need to bid on the Public Option. It includes \nthe allowance for multi-employer plans to apply to get federal acceptance to \noffer some of their plans to employees who might otherwise be without health \ninsurance. Additionally, thanks to a question raised by Senator Kieckhefer with \nrespect to the 15 percent for the premium reductions, we did add language to \nclarify that does apply to the Public Option only. It was not intended to apply to \nall health care plans. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will entertain a motion on S.B. 420. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS MOVED TO AMEND AND DO PASS AS AMENDED \nS.B. 420. \n \n  SENATOR SPEARMAN SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWe have incredible tools at our disposal to tackle the uninsured population in \nNevada via continued outreach through Medicaid as well as the eligible but \nunenrolled population for the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange, knowing \nthey have a significant increase in subsidies through the American Rescue Plan \nAct of 2021. Without understanding how we are going to capture some of the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 11, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nother populations of uninsureds, I cannot support the bill at this time based on \nthe disruption we will have in the insurance market. The bill directs the Director \nof the Department of Health and Human Services, the Director of the Silver \nState  Health  Insurance  Exchange  and  the  Commissioner  of  Insurance  in  the \nDepartment of Business and Industry to implement this public health benefit \nplan. We have not heard from them as to either the policy or applicability. I am \nuncomfortable with the bill at this time. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI agree with Senator Kieckhefer. We must continue to use the available tools we \nhave to get as many people covered and eligible for subsidies who have not yet \nsigned up for them. I will promote that the marketplace is unusually open at this \ntime of year. If people need health insurance, they can go to the marketplace \nand see if they qualify for subsidies. There have been numerous efforts to do \nthat and we need to do more. \n \nWe are still missing a whole subset of Nevadans who need another option and \nthis bill for a Public Option is good. I am hopeful this will generate some buzz \nthat will lead people to check out what they qualify for. Even if they do not sign \nup for the Public Option, they may find out they are eligible for Medicaid and a \nsubsidy in the marketplace. I support this bill and realize there is a long lead \ntime to get the actuarial information we need to proceed. That information will \nbe invaluable to this State in terms of how we move forward. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI have heard from people on both sides and understand how some feel it is more \ncomplicated than what we should get into right now. Based upon what has \nhappened to Nevadans, especially during Covid-19 and to the Black, Indigenous \nand People of Color communities, the Larry A. Green Center has an excellent \nreport  that  deals  with  how  communities  of  color  have  been  impacted  by \nCovid-19. We need to make sure people have insurance options. Some will say \nit is not perfect, but we should not let perfect be the enemy of good. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nOne  of  the  concerns  I  have  about  the  Public  Option  is  regarding  people \nbecoming discouraged when they look at 2025 or 2026. We have a virtual \npublic option now that is not as used as we would like it. I will be not be \nsupporting this measure, as well-intentioned as it may be. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 11, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nI think this is a great bill and, unfortunately, needed. If the private sector was \nproviding health care to everyone at a reasonable cost, this bill would not be a \nconsideration. It is not. It is entirely appropriate for the government to step in \nand try to offer something people can afford. We bear the costs when people go \nuninsured. It is our responsibility to make sure there are options out there for \npeople and that they are staying healthy. I will be supporting this bill today. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED. (SENATORS HARDY AND KIECKHEFER VOTED \nNO.) \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will now open the hearing on S.B. 438. \n \nSENATE BILL 438: Revises provisions related to agriculture. (BDR 51-1100) \n \nASHLEY  JEPPSON  (Division  Administrator,  Plant  Industry  Division,  State \nDepartment of Agriculture): \nI am presenting S.B. 438. The goal is for the Department of Agriculture to adopt \nthe produce safety-rule portions of the Food Safety Modernization Act. This is a \nfederal law that requires farms of a designated size and scope to comply with \nthe  Code  of  Federal  Regulations.  They  are  aimed  at  preventive  rather  than \nreactionary measures dealing with produce safety outbreaks. We learned a lot \nfrom outbreaks that have happened on farms or in distribution systems. The \ngoal is for the Department to adopt these produce safety rules so they can be \nenforced on a State level versus under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \n(FDA).  The  bill  also  allows  the  Department  to  react  should  there  be  an \nimmediate public safety risk pertaining to food. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThis bill is moving federal regulations to the State level. Do we have adequate \nresources to do this? \n \nMS. JEPPSON: \nYes. We conducted a survey to gauge whether our producers would prefer to \nsee this on a State level versus having FDA perform the inspections, and it was \nan overwhelming yes for the State. Part of the reason justifying this request is \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 11, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nthat  we  have  to  adopt  the  produce  rules  in  order  for  us  to  receive  federal \nresources. We operate under a cooperative agreement. We have to have this \nadopted in statutes. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSo you need the regulations to draw down the resources? \n \nMS. JEPPSON: \nYes. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nHearing no further testimony, I will close the hearing on S.B. 438. I will open \nthe hearing on A.B. 343. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 343 (1st Reprint): Provides for the development of plans for \nconducting  walking  audits  of  urbanized  areas  in  certain  counties. \n(BDR S-742) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN CLARA THOMAS (Assembly District No. 17): \nI am presenting A.B. 343 in its First Reprint, which is a step toward improving \nthe health of Nevadans. I have submitted my written presentation (Exhibit I). \n \nDAVID CLYDE (Associate General Counsel, Regional Transportation Commission \nof Southern Nevada): \nThe Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada (RTC) is proposing \na  friendly  amendment  to  A.B.  343  that  will  assist  in  effectuating  the  bill's \nobjectives  relating  to  promoting  safer  and  more  livable  communities.  I  have \nsubmitted our proposed amendment (Exhibit J). \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN THOMAS: \nI  urge  the  support  and  use  of  walking  audits  and  better  understanding  of \ncommunity needs. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nHow did you come up with such a wonderful bill? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN THOMAS: \nThe walking audit came from walking the community last summer when we had \nthe devastating prospect of our children not being able to access the internet. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 11, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nWe had little place cards that we put on doors and cars to have parents be able \nto access the internet. With that, I noticed crumbling sidewalks and dimmed \nstreet lamps causing me to be frightened at night because of not knowing if \ndogs would come out. It was suggested by Senator Dina Neal that we should \ndo a walking audit and that is how this bill came about. \n \nEMILY WALSH (Nevada Conservation League): \nWe support A.B.  343. Nevada is the eleventh most dangerous state in the \nNation for pedestrians. We must do a better job of making sure our streets are \nsafe for everyone. This bill will help our State better understand and address \nwalkable  neighborhoods  and  move  toward  creating  safe  environments  for \npedestrians,  bicyclists,  motorists  and  transit  riders.  Walkable  neighborhoods \nincrease equal opportunity, promote healthier communities and can help make \nthem  safer  and  more  accessible  and  enjoyable  for  everyone.  Increasing \nwalkability can also encourage people to leave their cars behind thus reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions and pollution. \n \nMICHAEL HILLERBY (Regional Transportation Commission of Washoe County): \nWe are neutral on A.B. 343. We have not been in front of our board with the \nchanges in the proposed amendment. Much of what is envisioned in the bill \nincludes  things  the  RTC  does.  We  obviously  invest  a  lot  in  multi-modal \ntransportation, traffic safety, pedestrian and bicycle safety and making sure the \nstreets and facilities RTC has jurisdiction over meet those criteria. We work \nregularly with the organizations outlined in the bill. We appreciate the addition in \nthe amendment. Both RTCs are sizable agencies governed by elected officials in \nour respective areas and the idea of having a bill draft request available certainly \nmakes sense to us. \n \nCYRUS HOJJATY: \nI am neutral on A.B. 343. I like this bill and echo the remarks of the previous \ncallers. I would like the bill to address crosswalks that are paved rather than \nasphalt, so people can see them when they drive due to the paint on the streets \nfading away, especially in Las Vegas. I think raised crosswalks are a better \nalternative than stop signs. Roundabouts, particularly turbo roundabouts like in \nEurope, move car traffic and pedestrian flow more effectively. There a lot of \nthings missing in the bill; however, pedestrian safety is a very important issue. \nA lot of people cannot afford cars. The roads we design, especially the major \narterial roads, need serious reform. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 11, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will now close the hearing on A.B. 343.

(BDR 40-1107) \n \nHEATHER KORBULIC (Policy Director, Office of the Governor): \nI am here today representing Governor Steven Sisolak as his Policy Director. \nWitnessing the Statewide collaboration in response to this historic pandemic has \nbeen  enlightening  and  inspiring.  If  not  for  the  dedication  and  sincere \ncommitment from public and private partnerships, State and local public health \nworkforces,  nurses,  doctors,  medical  teams,  hospitals,  first  responders,  the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Department of Emergency \nManagement (DEM), the Nevada National Guard, the Nevada State Public Health \nLaboratory, and so many others, we may not have been able to realize the level \nof success we can look back on with pride. \n \nOver this past year, in many ways, Nevada did what they always do. They \nshowed up for one another, and in the darkest hours, Nevada’s battle born grit \nand practiced resilience provided much needed light. \n \nCovid-19 has exposed many of our State’s strengths and weaknesses. While we \nhave demonstrated the ability to respond to a public health crisis of significant \nmagnitude,  we  have  done  it  with  a  frail,  and  in  some  cases,  nonexistent \nessential public health infrastructure. \n \nWhile we have been able to respond effectively to this prolonged crisis, we have \nexhausted nearly every aspect of the Statewide public health system. From the \nbeginning  of  the  Covid-19  impact  on  the  State,  Governor  Sisolak  has  been \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \ncommitted to examining the data and listening to scientific experts as he made \ndecisions  to  balance  the  State’s  public  health  and  economic  needs.  This \ncommitment led to impossibly hard decisions with significant consequences and \nultimately highlighted the State public health workforce needs.  \n \nPublic health touches every single thing from DHHS to DEM to the Department \nof  Motor  Vehicles.  Every  service  of  the  State  plays  a  part  in  public  health \nresponse.  \n \nIn April 2020, Governor Sisolak released a guidance called the Nevada United: \nRoadmap to Recovery plan where he outlined the State’s goals to recovery. \nOne of  those  goals  was  to  turn  this  unprecedented  challenge  into  a  rare \nopportunity  to  transform  Nevada’s  approach  to  governance,  public  health, \neducation and economic diversification.  \n \nWe have an opportunity to learn from the experience of this pandemic to build a \nplan for a public health system we need in an emergency or our day-to-day \nefforts to serve the public health needs of Nevadans. \n \nSenate Bill 424, with the proposed amendment (Exhibit O), creates a Public \nHealth  Resource  Office  in  the  Office  of  the  Governor  to  analyze  existing \ninfrastructure for meeting Nevada’s public health needs. The Office will analyze \nthe relationships between the people and entities involved in the provision of \npublic health services including local health authorities, providers of health care, \nhealthcare facilities and not-for-profit groups. \n \nThe role of the Office is to identify and make recommendations to the Governor \nand the Legislature concerning the State’s unmet needs. It will also recommend \nopportunities  to  obtain  federal  or  private  funding  to  support  public  health \nservices  and  ways  in  which  the  State  can  improve  coordination  between \nproviders of public health services and the delivery of those services. \n \nCALEB CAGE (Covid-19 Response Director, Office of the Governor): \nThe proposed amendment, Exhibit O, is relatively straightforward where the first \nversion of the bill created the Public Health Resource Office within the Division \nof Public and Behavioral Health (DPBH) of DHHS. We are proposing to move this \nto the Office of the Governor. In all versions of the bill, the purpose of the \nOffice  has  remained  the  same  ensuring  Nevada’s  overall  public  health \ninfrastructure has a strategic vision for future improvements, and to ensure best \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \npractices  and  lessons  learned  from  the  recent  global  pandemic  inform  this \nvision.  It  also  ensures  actionable  fiscal  and  policy  recommendations  are \ndeveloped  to  pursue  this  vision.  While  these  objectives  remain  the  same, \nGovernor Sisolak believes they can be better achieved by elevating this Office \ninto the Office of the Governor.  \n \nElevating the Public Health Recourse Office from the DPBH to the Office of the \nGovernor  will  have  many  benefits.  This  position  elevates  the  importance  of \npublic health and the discussion we intend to have with this agency which has \nlong  lacked  strategic  investment  and  support.  Further  comprehensive  public \nhealth is larger than one agency and this amendment, Exhibit O, will allow for a \ngovernment approach in the future with respect to day-to-day operations and \nemergency  operations  as  a  crisis  response  such  as  we  have  recently \nexperienced. \n \nWith respect to day-to-day operations, the Office can identify how all State \nagencies invest support in proven public health outcomes by ensuring it is not \nmerely the responsibility of a single division within DHHS. During emergency \noperations,  the  Office  can  identify  opportunities  to  improve  collaboration \nbetween  response  and  support  organizations  like  the  State’s  Public  Health \nPreparedness Program within the DEM. \n \nJULIA PEEK, M.H.A., C.P.M. (Deputy Administrator, Community Health Services, \nDivision  of  Public  and  Behavioral  Health,  Department  of  Health  and \nHuman Services): \nI will read from my written remarks (Exhibit P) to present S.B. 424. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe efforts of the Department of Health and Human Services have not gone \nunnoticed by the Senate Committee on Senate Health and Human Services and \nthe entire Legislature, and we are grateful for your service over the last year and \na half. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThe communities of color were hardest hit both physically and mentally. This \nappears to be a good opportunity for the BIPOC community or someone with \ncultural sensitivity to address the needs of that community. There have been \nsuicides  by  both  young  and  old  people  in  the  Black  community  during  the \npandemic. The response, in terms of how we get a handle on it, was from \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \npastors and people trained in mental and emotional health. I want to make sure \nwe are looking at this from the standpoint of diversity. There is strength in a \nteam when you have diverse voices at the table. \n \nWhat are we going to do to ensure we diversify? \n \nMS. PEEK: \nThe public health system has been looking at disparities addressing the issue, \nand  the  establishment  of  an  office  to  help  us  provide  guidance  to  all  our \nprograms. Members of our community have been consulting with the Office of \nthe Governor on a weekly basis on how we can improve. \n \nWe applied for a grant from our partners at the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (CDC). If we are awarded the grant, it will be focused on diversity \nand disparity in our rural communities. The entire award will be looking at and \nvetting people within the community and from the community to assess broad \npublic health. \n \nKnowing  our  BIPOC  communities  have  comorbidities  and,  if  infected,  would \nhave more severe cases has been one of our challenges during the pandemic. It \nwill address all issues to make a healthier person get better self-care for chronic \ndisease,  finding  preventative  services  easier  for  the  community  and  getting \ninformation to the people in the community. \n \nThrough this grant, we are looking to partner with religious institutions and \ncommunity health workers within the community to be our messengers. This \nOffice is interested in addressing the needs of our BIPOC communities. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nWill there be outreach to see if there is anyone in the BIPOC community to fill \nthis position? In BIPOC communities, the comorbidities are off the chart. I have \nstruggled this Session to ensure I have relevant bills that speak to this. It is not \na matter of if, it is a matter of when the next pandemic will occur. High blood \npressure, asthma and diabetes are a part of the systemic racism problem and \nthe CDC agrees with this. If we are not intentional about repairing this, it will \ncontinue. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nMS. KORBULIC: \nGovernor Sisolak is committed to addressing disparities and health inequities we \nhave seen amplified by this pandemic, and this Office will be committed to \naddressing those needs with person and policy. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nOn a practical level, how does the Public Health Resource Office and the Office \nof the Governor work with DHHS and DPBH? \n \nMS. KORBULIC: \nWe intend to be closely aligned with DHHS on the projects Ms. Peek outlined, \nand it has become clear to us it takes every State agency. Pushing this position \ninto the Office of the Governor allows for elevated prioritization of authority \nnecessary  to  work  with  all  agencies  and  health  authorities  getting  them  on \nboard with developing response efforts.  \n \nCONNOR CAIN (Hospital Corporation of America; Sunrise Hospital and Medical \nCenter; Sunrise Children’s Hospital; Southern Hills Hospital and Medical \nCenter, Mountain View Hospital): \nHospital  Corporation  of  America,  on  behalf  of  Sunrise,  Sunrise  Children’s, \nSouthern Hills and Mountain View Hospitals support S.B. 424. \n \nOver  the  past  year,  our  hospitals  have  cared  for  nearly  10,000  Covid-19 \npositive patients and insured Nevadans, including those in the most vulnerable \nzip codes, had access to free antibody treatments. \n \nAs part of our efforts to continue learning from the pandemic and improve our \nability  to  serve  our  community,  we  strongly  support  Governor  Sisolak, \nMs. Korbulic, Mr. Cage and Ms. Peek’s efforts in S.B. 424. \n \nAs we begin to see light at the end of the tunnel, the Public Health Resource \nOffice will play a vital role to amplify our States efforts to educate, test and \nvaccinate our residents. For the reasons Ms. Peek mentioned, the Office will \npay significant dividends far beyond the pandemic immeasurably impacting the \nlives of many Nevadans. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nBRADLEY  MAYER  (Southern  Nevada  Health  District;  Washoe  County  Health \nDistrict): \nThe  Southern  Nevada  and  Washoe  County  Health  Districts  are  enthusiastic \nabout S.B. 424 and appreciate the Office of the Governor bringing this concept \nforward. \n \nThe Covid-19 pandemic has shown us how important public health functions \nare,  not  just  to  physical  health  but  to  our  economy.  Public  health  and  its \npartners, along with a wide variety of government agencies, have risen to the \noccasion as Nevada has battled Covid-19 while carrying out other public health \nresponsibilities. \n \nNevada  ranks  near  the  bottom  on  many  foreign  public  health  measures, \nespecially  regarding  infrastructure.  According  to  America’s  health  rankings, \nNevada ranks last in most State and federal dollars dedicated to public health; \nabout  $40  per  person  less  than  the  national  average.  According  to  a \nJanuary 2020  report  released  by  Trust  for  America’s  Health,  along  with \n13 other  states  for  preparedness  to  protect  the  public’s  health  during  an \nemergency, Nevada scored 3 out of a possible 10 in measures of public health \npreparedness  for  disease,  disasters  and  bioterrorism.  Deaths  owed  to  drug \nmisuse,  alcohol,  and  suicide  outpace  the  Country.  The  rate  of  obesity  and \nrelated conditions are high. Nevada’s sexually transmitted infections rates are \nsignificantly  higher  than  national  rates,  and  we  rank  first  for  primary  and \nsecondary syphilis. We also have our challenges with mental and behavioral \nhealth which have been exacerbated by the pandemic. We rank fifty-first for \nhigher  prevalence  of  mental  illness,  lower  rates  of  access  to  care,  and \n80 percent of rural counties nationwide report not having behavioral healthcare \nworkers. \n \nThere are several bills addressing some of the issues this Session and public \nhealth is grateful for this policy. Attempting to address some of the issues in \nprevious  sessions  would  have  allocated  $5  per  capita  or  approximately \n$50 million  to  enhance  foundational  public  health  infrastructure  Statewide. \nNevada ranks fiftieth in public health funding and would have ranked no higher \nthan forty-eighth with that investment. \n \nThis  comes  down  to  a  matter  of  resources  in  having  an  office  focused  on \nworking with stakeholders to come up with solutions to strengthen our public \nhealth system above and beyond what we are doing. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nALLISON GENCO (Dignity Health - St. Rose Dominican): \nDignity Health - St. Rose Dominican supports S.B. 424. St. Rose Dominican \nworks to address public health needs by focusing on the social determinates of \nhealth and finding ways to extend services in Las Vegas. We operate wellness \ncenters located in our neighborhood hospitals that offer free or low-cost classes \nto educate people on health-related matters including information on parenting, \nbaby safety, diabetes, blood pressure and exercise.  \n \nWe agree to address public health needs, we must address the public health \ninfrastructure first and foremost. St. Rose Dominican is proud to be part of the \npublic health infrastructure in southern Nevada. We support finding innovative \nways to bolster the public health infrastructure and creating the Public Health \nResource Office will be a major step in that direction. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 424. \n \nEMILY MIMNAUGH (Pacific Justice Institute): \nI  am  an  attorney  in  Nevada  testifying  on  behalf  of  Pacific  Justice  Institute \nopposing A.B 287. This bill raises significant and fundamental concerns about \npublic and legal policy. The stated aim of the bill is furthering the welfare of \npregnant  mothers.  Unfortunately,  the  bill  strays  far  from  its  initial  purpose. \nInstead of protecting mothers, it erases any reference to them 40 times over. \nThe bill seeks the redefinition of a parent-child relationship by eliminating the \nterms mother and father throughout the law.  \n \nThese changes are deeply problematic as a matter of public policy and as a \nmatter of law. As a matter of public policy, the stated purpose of the bill bears \nno relation to this “terminology revision”. Simultaneously, it denies the relation \nof a mother and father to their child. As a matter of law, the denial of a “mother \nand father” is inconsistent with the entirety of the Nevada Revised Statutes \n(NRS) which is replete with references to a mother and father. This creates \nconfusion and inconsistency. \n \nAssembly Bill 287 does not follow the fundamentals of logic and deletes any \nreference  to  a  “mother.”  To  achieve  this,  it  is  performing  busying,  if  not \ntongue-tying verbal gymnastics to offer four different vocabulary options “as \nappropriate”. The bill provides for new terms so a mother can now only be \ncalled either a person who is pregnant, a person giving birth, a person who gave \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nbirth or a person who has given birth as appropriate. The bill transforms the \nfather into “other parent.” The bill erases a child’s mother from existence; she \ncan never be a mother.  \n \nLegally,  NRS  does  not  reduce  a  mother  only  to  her  status  of  pregnant  or \nbirthing. If the goal is to rewrite the entirety of the NRS with these ill-conceived \nand radical revisions, this goal is over reaching and impractical. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRemainder of page intentionally left blank; signature page to follow.   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSeeing no further public comment, the meeting is adjourned at 4:31 p.m. \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nVickie Polzien, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nExhibit  Begins \nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \nLetter  on Page \nAgenda \n  A  1   \nWork Session Document \nA.B. 438  B  1  Megan Comlossy \nWork Session Document \nA.B. 178  C  1  Megan Comlossy \nWork Session Document \nA.B. 197  D  1  Megan Comlossy \nWork Session Document \nA.B. 205  E  1  Megan Comlossy \nWork Session Document \nA.B. 228  F  1  Megan Comlossy \nWork Session Document \nA.B. 278  G  1  Megan Comlossy \nWork Session Document \nA.B. 287  H  1  Megan Comlossy \nWork Session Document \nA.B. 326  I  1  Megan Comlossy \nWork Session Document \nA.B. 343  J  1  Megan Comlossy \nWork Session Document \nA.B. 344  K  1  Megan Comlossy \nWork Session Document \nA.B. 345  L  1  Megan Comlossy \nWork Session Document \nA.B. 374  M  1  Megan Comlossy \nWork Session Document \nA.B. 430  N  1  Megan Comlossy \n \nHeather Korbulic /  Proposed Amendment \nS.B. 424  O  1 \nOffice of the Governor \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 13, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nJulia Peek / Department \nWritten Testimony \nS.B. 424  P  1  of Health and Human \nServices \n ", "\nMINUTES OF THE  \nSENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n \nEighty-first Session \nMay 18, 2021 \n \n \nThe Senate Committee on Health and Human Services was called to order by \nChair  Julia  Ratti  at  5:47  p.m.  on  Tuesday,  May  18,  2021,  Online  and  in \nRoom 2134 of the Legislative Building, Carson City, Nevada.

This is a bill we have \nalready had a work session on, and it went out of this Committee with an \namend, do pass. It went to the Senate Committee on Finance, and there was a \nsignificant rework of this bill between the time it was in the work session and in \nthe Committee on Finance. In the Committee on Finance, we only dealt with the \nfinance issue, and the Committee on Finance sent it back to this Committee so \nwe could look at the full amendment. There are two exhibits posted online \nwhich will address the two components of S.B. 390. The first part of this bill is \nthe  9-8-8  Suicide  Hotline,  and  the  second  part  of  this  bill  is  the  opioid \nsettlement framework. Dr. Stephanie Woodard has been heavily involved in the \nupdates and will walk us through the amended version.  \n \nSENATE BILL 390 (1st Reprint): Revises provisions relating to behavioral health. \n(BDR 39-635) \n \nMEGAN COMLOSSY (Policy Analyst): \nThere is a work session document with Proposed Amendment 3328 (Exhibit B) \nfor S.B. 390 that Dr. Woodard will be discussing. \n \nSTEPHANIE WOODARD, PSY.D. (Senior Advisor on Behavioral Health, Division of \nPublic and Behavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services): \nIn addition, I will also briefly outline the two tables (Exhibit C and Exhibit D) \nrelating to behavioral health and what this bill is intending to do. Senate Bill 390 \nmakes two key changes relating to behavioral health. The  first requires the \nDivision of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human \nServices (DHHS) to establish a hotline—which may be accessed by dialing 9-8-8 \nfor people who are considering suicide or are in a behavioral health crisis—and \nto  create  at  least  one  support  center  to  answer  calls  and  coordinate  the \nresponse to those calls. \n \nThe second part of the bill creates the Nevada Fund for Healthy Communities to \nhold  the  proceeds  of  litigation  by  the  State  concerning  the  manufacture, \ndistribution, sale and marketing of opioids. The bill will also provide for the \ndistribution  of  that  money  as  grants  to  State,  regional,  local  and  tribal \ngovernments and nonprofit organizations for projects that address the impacts \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 18, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nof opioid use disorder and other substance use disorders. It requires the DHHS \nto conduct a needs assessment to determine priorities for allocating money from \nthe Fund and to distribute the grants. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nA  few  of  the  items  Dr.  Woodard  has  outlined  are  different  than  what  was \npresented to the Senate Committee on Finance last week. I want to highlight a \ncouple of those points as we are working with the telecommunications industry \nthat is going to collect a lot of this revenue.  \n \nSection  3,  subsection  3  of  Proposed  Amendment  3328  provides  liability \nprotection for telecommunication providers which is something they requested. \nSection 5, subsection 1 of the amendment states \"the amount of the surcharge \nmust not exceed 50 cents for each access line or trunk line.\" I suggest an \namendment  to  cap  the  amount  at  35  cents  knowing  that  would  provide  a \nsufficient revenue match through available federal dollars to address the goals \nand  objectives  of  the  account.  Additionally,  this  provides  the  regulatory \noversight for creating that surcharge to the State Board of Health rather than \nthe Public Utilities Commission of Nevada and then have to go through the usual \nAdministrative Procedures Act to walk through the regulatory process of the \nState Board of Health.  \n \nSection 5, subsection 2, paragraph (b) of the amendment states that any funds \ngenerated by this new surcharge cannot be used to supplant existing funding \nthat currently is used for those behavioral health services. These are the primary \ndifferences between what was presented to the Senate Committee on Finance \nin this section of the bill and what you see in Proposed Amendment 3328. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe are in agreement with all of those changes, which are considered friendly \nchanges  to  the  bill.  Dr.  Woodard,  please  move  on  to  the  opioid  settlement \nportion of the bill. \n \nDR. WOODARD: \nI  will  briefly  address  the  S.B.  390  Fund  for  a  Resilient  Nevada–Opioid \nSettlement/Litigation Funding Exhibit D, specifically sections 7 through 9.5. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 18, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe learned how specifically targeted the opioid settlement dollars are to the \nStatewide impact of the opioid epidemic. A lot of the work was reframing the \nwhole process to a Statewide response, which includes the needs assessment, \nplan and distribution process. I want to thank Senator Kieckhefer for helping \nwith the amendments that would make sure the Legislature has a significant \nrole in approving it during the Legislative Session every biennium and through \nthe Interim Finance Committee process. Based on some of the comments from \nthe Committee members, we made sure there are multiple places in the bill that \nnow look at the disparate impact on certain communities, and we are doing \noutreach to lots of individuals who we may not get to otherwise. Those are the \nbig significant changes we made. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe intent coming out of the Senate Committee on Finance was to ensure that \nthe account set up pursuant to this act would be an Executive Budget account, \nand  we  would  budget  these  funds  similar  to  the  method  we  used  for  the \nHealthy Nevada Fund so that DHHS will come up with an expenditure plan to be \nincorporated into the agency’s budget proposal. We would move forward that \nway  and  make  adjustments  as  necessary  if  additional  settlements  come  in \nduring the Interim, potentially through the Interim Finance Committee process. I \nwould like to move forward with the amendment today. What we have before \nus reinserts the role of the Legislature in the process and ensures that it moves \ninto an Executive Budget account rather than a nonexecutive account. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThis bill has been on a journey, and it has gotten to a good place. It has a \nstrong problematic side where we are making sure the settlement always gets \nused to address the impact of the opioid epidemic, as well as ensuring there is a \ngood  focus  on  disparate  communities.  At  the  same  time,  it  is  doing  the \nimportant  work  that  Senator  Kieckhefer  has  identified  in  making  sure  the \nLegislature retains its ability to direct these funds in the future. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThis bill is quite encouraging because this is a major step for us moving in the \ndirection of bringing equity to the communities that have been hurt so badly by \nthe opioid pandemic. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 18, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI received the two handouts that are impressive with the work that went into \nthem. Regarding the Fund for a Resilient Nevada, no State money is going to \nthis unless it is for the needs assessment that must be done.  Is this Fund \ncompletely separate and distinct from any State money and therefore does not \nhave a two-thirds requirement to increase a fee or tax? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe Fund for a Resilient Nevada is a bucket that catches all of the settlement \ndollars into an Executive Budget account so they can be appropriately handled. \nThere  would  be  no  effect  on  the  General  Fund.  The  bill  does  contemplate \n8 percent of allowed administrative costs so the work can be implemented, but \nthe majority of it gets out and makes a difference. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI was correct in that assumption. Regarding the Crisis Response Account, has \nthe State Board of Health ever adopted regulations determining the amount of a \nsurcharge, or is that a new concept we are looking at? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIn that fund, the surcharge is to stand up the 9-8-8 hotline, and the 35 cents \nper line goes into the fund. The amendment puts a cap up to 35 cents. The \nregulatory process will determine what the actual need is, but it can go no \nhigher than 35 cents. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe regulatory board decides something that usually is a legislative decision \nabout how much of a fee to charge. I do not know of anybody who gets to \ndetermine their own fee without legislative oversight. \n \nERIC ROBBINS (Counsel): \nIt is common where the Legislature sets the maximum amount of a fee. The \nboards can prescribe less than that fee if they want, which is common for \nprofessional licensing boards that operate that way. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIs that the one that puts this bill at a two-thirds majority vote? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 18, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThat  is  correct.  The  two-thirds  on  this  particular  bill  comes  from  the \nimplementation of the new surcharge fee on the phone lines. \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nI would also like to point out for the licensure of medical facilities, Nevada \nRevised Statutes 449.050 lets the State Board of Health set application fees at \nan amount determined by regulation of the Board. In that case, the State Board \nof Health does determine the licensing fees. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe  reason  is  that  we  have  a  9-8-8  planning  grant  underway  at  this  time. \nThrough the process of that 9-8-8 planning grant, we are assessing the need, \nwhich will determine what the appropriate budget needs are to set that fee. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nA lot of work went into this, and I am impressed. One of the challenges I have \nis where this is all going to fit at the end and how we are going to afford it. I \nwill be voting no, but I am impressed and willing to consider changing my vote \nlater if it all fits together. \n \nSENATOR  HARRIS  MOVED  TO  AMEND  AND  DO  PASS  AS  AMENDED \nS.B. 390. \n \n  SENATOR SPEARMAN SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe  motion  includes  a  deviation  from  Proposed  Amendment  3328  from \n50 cents to 35 cents. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThank you for the clarification. It would include lowering the cap to 35 cents. \n \n  THE MOTION CARRIED. (SENATOR HARDY VOTED NO.) \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will now open the hearing on Assembly Bill (A.B.) 348. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 18, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 348 (1st Reprint): Revises provisions relating to the Patient \nProtection Commission. (BDR 40-497) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN MAGGIE CARLTON (Assembly District No. 14): \nI am presenting A.B. 348 which will make changes to the provisions governing \nthe Patient Protection Commission. The bill went through a large rewrite in the \nAssembly,  and  we  are  now  working  from  the  first  reprint.  During  the \n2019 Legislative Session, Governor Steve Sisolak proposed and the Legislature \npassed  S.B.  No.  544  of  the  80th  Session,  creating  the  Patient  Protection \nCommission,  an  independent  body  tasked  with  reviewing  issues  related  to \nNevadans’ healthcare needs, as well as healthcare accessibility, affordability and \nquality.  However,  as  we  all  know,  legislation  is  iterative,  and  after  the \nCommission got up and running, we recognized the need to make adjustments \nto it. I want to thank Dr. Ikram Kahn and Sara Cholhagian for their hard work \nthroughout the process. \n \nThe goals of A.B. 348 are to move the Commission from the Office of the \nGovernor to DHHS, revise Commission membership, ensure members are held \naccountable,  address  issues  related  to  conflicts  of  interest  and  give  the \nCommission tools to operate more effectively. The concerns I heard today are \nthat folks want to see more people come onto the Commission and not be \nreplaced. The proposal in this bill is to replace some members. It is to get this \nCommission to the point where we are talking about having real data, quality, \naccessibility and affordability of health care. \n \nThe 11 members of the Commission at this time can be viewed as industry \nstakeholders in a number of ways. Partway through the work the Commission \nwas doing, I started to hear concerns about conflict issues. You will see in this \nbill that we added standard language of disclosure and conflict so everyone \nknows who they are representing. That is how we addressed that particular \nissue. These changes in membership will make a significant difference in the \nwork this Commission will be able to do in the future to get good, hard data. \n \nAs long as I have been in this building, unfortunately, we have had to make a \nlot of decisions based on health care with anecdotal data. We can now start \nmaking real decisions. As you go through the memberships, you will see a lot of \nit  switched  over  to  a  more  nonprofit  world  than  the  for-profit  world.  Just \nbecause you are nonprofit does not mean you do not have a budget you have to \nbalance and you do not have to be accountable for the dollars. It means there is \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 18, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \na  different  attitude  toward  it.  We  tried  to  incorporate  some  of  the  existing \nmemberships and change others to represent a broader base of who would be \nthe best voice for patients in the future. \n \nThis  Commission  will  have  sole  authority  over  the  Milbank  Memorial  Fund \nProgram that the Patient Protection Commission will be able to work on and \nthat aims at sustainable healthcare costs. This will be a lot of work for the \nCommission to get done over this biennium. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThank you for acknowledging that this bill had the all-payer claims database and \nfor working with the Executive Director of the Patient Protection Commission \nearly in the Session to make sure that we did not have multiple vehicles and \nconflicting work going on. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe  sponsor  already  alluded  to  my  questions.  If  we  concentrate  on  the \nnonprofits, we are not getting half or more of the care provided by hospitals, \nhealth insurers, academic institutions or the pharmaceutical industry. That is my \nconcern with the bill. We do need the data, and it is a one-armed input. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nMy question is related to the health information exchange language in section 3, \nsubsection 1, paragraph (c). We have the Statewide-designated Nevada Health \nInformation Exchange which is working to continue to expand its network of \nproviders and facilities that are coordinating the exchange of health information. \nI am trying to understand what we are getting at in this part of the bill. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN CARLTON: \nIt is to allow the Commission to have jurisdiction over that particular area and to \nmake sure the interoperability of that works and the data is updated. It is also to \nmake sure the data is shared and comes back to the Legislature for future \nconversations. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nCan  you  please  tell  me  what  the  Peterson-Milbank  Program  for  Sustainable \nHealth Care Costs is? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 18, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN CARLTON: \nIt is a grant that the Patient Protection Commission, through the leadership of \nits director, received, and the Commission will enable to work further to address \nhealthcare costs in this State. Some of the things we have talked about in the \npast have been cost-to-charge ratio versus billable costs versus network costs, \nout-of-network costs and looking at all the different costs across the State. \nWhen you look at that and the makeup of the Commission—this is in no way \nmeant to be insulting to any of the members that were on the Commission—we \nhave to understand that this current Commission has a true industry flavor to it. \nIf we are going to have honest, objective conversations, the industry needs to \nstep back and let other people come forward and have those real conversations. \nThis does not say that the industry cannot participate; they just will not be \nvoting members. When we get into real discussions about healthcare costs in \nthe future, we need to make sure we have people on this Commission who do \nnot have the inherent conflict of providing data and talking about costs when \ntheir job is to be part of this Commission but they are being paid by an industry.  \n \nI am trying to be as polite about this as possible because I understand everyone \nhas a job to do. I represent a group of people, so do each of you Senators, but \nwe all have to make sure we put the right people on these Commissions who \nwill make the good decisions for Nevada and not for their industry. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe  Peterson-Milbank  Grant  is  a  wonderful  grant.  We  need  to  give \nSara Cholhagian two minutes to talk about it because it is something the world \nshould know about. \n \nSARA CHOLHAGIAN (Executive Director, Patient Protection Commission): \nIt  was  announced  on  March  9  that  Nevada  joined  four  other  states, \nConnecticut, Oregon, New Jersey and Washington, to be part of a program that \nimplements  spending  targets  to  make  health  care  more  transparent  and \naffordable.  With  Nevada's  participation  in  this  program,  we  are  receiving \ntechnical  assistance  from  Bailet  Health,  which  is  helping  Nevada  set  and \nimplement healthcare cost growth targets. These targets are a first step toward \nmaking health care more affordable and transparent. The goals of this project \nare to focus on the underlying causes of rising healthcare costs and to develop \nthe capacity to track and benchmark healthcare spending across payers at the \nState level.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 18, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nIn addition, the project will analyze spending data in an effort to pinpoint cost \ndrivers and inform interventions. This is an exciting time for Nevada to have this \nmultistate collaborative effort. It is a two-year program that helps our State \nlaunch into establishing a benchmark and looking at healthcare spending in a \ndata-driven way. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nCongratulations for leading that effort. Is there a requirement that we need to \ndesignate a lead agency as part of that participation? \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nNo, there is no program requirement to designate any sole agency. Rather, there \nis  a  requirement  that  the  Governor  designate  a  State  lead  to  manage  the \nparticipation of this program. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThis is exciting. Washington State has been doing this program since 2014. It \nwas introduced by Senator Randi Becker and passed on bipartisan lines because \nthis is important information. It will put more power in the hands of consumers \nbecause they will be able to see exactly what is going on. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIs the Veterans Health Administration (VA) Hospital going to be involved with \nthis?  Sunrise  Hospital  is  for  profit,  but  the  VA  Hospital  is  not.  I  do  have \nmisgivings about the one-armed approach, but are we going to involve the VA \nsystem? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAssemblywoman  Carlton,  would  the  VA  Hospital  qualify  for  the  nonprofit \nhospital seat if that was who the Governor wanted? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN CARLTON: \nThe VA is under federal jurisdiction, and I would not want to speak for the \nfederal government. I am not sure, but there is nothing that would prohibit the \nVA from participating as far as public members being involved in the meetings \nand providing input. As for how the VA is classified, I am not aware of that. It \nis purely federal jurisdiction, and I am unsure of what opportunities there would \nbe.  Nothing  in  this  bill  would  prohibit  the  VA  from  being  a  part  of  the \nconversations in public meetings. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 18, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nIt would qualify if it is a nonprofit hospital. A federal hospital would qualify if it \nwas chosen, if it met the other criteria, and if it wants to participate. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN CARLTON: \nThat is great knowledge. As this bill moves forward, the Governor needs to \nknow this so that as he chooses representation, he can reach out to someone at \nthe  VA  and  tell  them  there  may  possibly  be  an  opportunity  for  the  VA  to \nparticipate. These members will all still be chosen by the Governor. That would \nbe  an  excellent  conversation  point  to  have  with  the  Governor  as  we  move \nforward. \n \nSTACIE SASSO (Health Services Coalition): \nWe  support  A.B.  348.  When  the  Governor  formed  the  Patient  Protection \nCommission, it was with the intention of protecting the patient with price focus \nbeing one of those topics. In order for the Commission to be effective, we need \nto ensure patient voices are front and center of the Commission, not just have \nthe  industry  perspective  when  healthcare  policy  recommendations  are  being \nshaped.  The  Commission's  main  mission  should  be  to  examine  healthcare \naccess, quality and affordability in the State and make policy recommendations \nto continue to improve a well-healthcare system for patients in Nevada. \n \nRUSTY MCALLISTER (Nevada State AFL-CIO): \nWe support A.B. 348. This is a good policy and provides information to the \npeople that utilize health services. This will provide more of a perspective from \nthe people who utilize the health services as opposed to those who are running \nthe  hospital  industry  or  the  medical  industry.  Most  of  all,  this  will  provide \ninformation for patients and is a good way for them to be represented. \n \nMAYA HOLMES (Culinary Workers Union Local 226 Health Fund): \nWe support A.B. 348. Governor Sisolak's 2019 decision in the Legislature to \ncreate the Patient Protection Commission was an essential step to improve the \nhealthcare  system  for  all  Nevadans.  The  Commission's  primary  goal  is  to \nexamine and propose solutions to address access, quality and affordability in \nour healthcare system. There is no question Nevadans need and deserve access \nto high quality, affordable health care. Unfortunately, ensuring the Commission \nis getting direct patients' perspectives and experiences has been a challenge. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 18, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nWe want the Commission to be a voice for patients, which can then be the \nbackbone  in  developing  effective  policy  solutions.  The  inclusion  of  more \nmembers with the history of advocating on behalf of insured and uninsured \npatients and working in the nonprofit sector is simply essential. The new voices \nwill bring specific and much-needed, patient-centered expertise crucial to the \nCommission's work. The intent of this bill is to maintain a Commission whose \nsize does not become unwieldy but still expands the breadth of expertise to \nensure a greater focus on and broader range of patient experiences are balanced \nwith the industry perspectives and interests. We support the effort to address \nany conflicts of interest, adopt needed bylaws and place the Commission within \nthe DHHS. This will ensure it has additional tools and the structure it needs to \nachieve its goals. \n \nJAMES WADHAMS (Nevada Hospital Association): \nWe are neutral on A.B. 348. We have no opposition to expanding to additional \nmembership  on  the  Patient  Protection  Commission.  Additional  perspective  is \nespecially helpful. This Commission had a difficult start because the board was \nnot  fully  appointed  until  approximately  January  and,  unfortunately,  within \n30 days after its first meeting, the Covid-19 crisis hit and constrained some of \nthe activity. Ultimately, the Senate Committee on Health and Human Services \nproduced two bills that are moving well through this process. The first is S.B. 5, \ndealing with telemedicine, and it has proven to be a significant opportunity to \nensure people in a lockdown period still have access to care. The second is \nS.B. 40, which addresses the all-payer claims database, and that seems to be \nmoving through the process. \n \nSENATE BILL 5 (2nd Reprint): Makes changes relating to telehealth. (BDR 40-\n416) \n \nSENATE BILL 40 (1st Reprint): Provides for the collection of certain data relating \nto health care. (BDR 40-415) \n \nOur concern is eliminating one of the positions representing hospitals; there are \ntwo  in  the  bill  and  on  the  current  Commission.  Eliminating  that  upon  the \nexpiration  of  either  one  of  those  terms  is  problematic.  Nevada  has  over \n35 short-term  acute  care  hospitals  spread  over  northern,  southern  and  rural \nNevada. There are county, district, nonprofit and for-profit hospitals. There may \nbe an opportunity for a federal hospital as well. Under the mix of our short-term \nhospitals, 92 percent of the patient days are accessed in private hospitals. In \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 18, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \norder to fully evaluate costs, the information on the cost drivers of the delivery \nof that service is critical. The voices and costs of that care should be available \nto a broader, expanded Commission so the perspective of the delivery of care \ncan be blended into the consideration of the costs and use of care. \n \nThe Governor created the Commission with the help of the Legislature in 2019, \nand he took care to identify the positions that should be part of the balance of \nthat body and specifically have the authority to identify those individuals. During \nthe Covid-19 emergency, the Governor focused his Task Force for COVID-19 \nMitigation  and  Management  on  maintaining  hospital  capacity  and  issued  a \ndeclaration to the Commission to particularly learn the lessons that would be \nexperienced during the Covid-19 crisis. Hospitals were asked to expand capacity \ndramatically to accommodate patient admissions which, at one point, were over \n2,000 per day. The perspective that comes from the variety and differentiation \nof the various hospitals is going to be critical, even for an expanded Protection \nCommission. We have no concerns about the expansion of that Commission, \nbut we would request that the Committee consider reinstating at least one more \nhospital to provide the diversity of that perspective and the cost drivers that go \nwith that. \n \nGEORGE ROSS (Hospital Corporation of America): \nWe  are  neutral  on  A.B.  348.  We  echo  the  words  of  Mr.  Wadhams.  We \ncompletely agree with the objectives stated by the sponsor of this bill: \"quality, \naccess and affordability.\" The key is that 92 percent of the patient beds are in \nthe private sector. This State has for the last 50 to 60 years relied upon the \nprivate sector to keep up the amount and the investments in health care that \nthis State needs to keep up with its growing population. Similarly, virtually all \nthe investments are in the private sector in terms of new quality, both in terms \nof how you practice it, how you apply it and how you bring in new features and \ntreatments. This all comes through the private sector. It is imperative, if we are \ntalking about access and quality, that we take their needs into account. You \ncannot take them for granted.  \n \nFinally, affordability is an area of cost and especially when the Commission has \njust begun the Peterson-Milbank work. You need people on that Commission \nwho understand the practical side of health care and costs. We strongly urge \nyou to add back a hospital member in addition to what is in the bill and make it \njust  a  plain  hospital  member  and  not  specifically  say  nonprofit  because  the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 18, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nprivate  sector  provides  so  much  of  the  health  care  in  this  State.  That \nperspective and knowledge are needed. \n \nROCKY FINSETH (PhRMA): \nWe are neutral on A.B. 348. We support Governor Sisolak's efforts at creating \nthe  Commission.  As  previously  mentioned,  we  request  insertion  of  the \npharmaceutical  representative  back  in  the  Commission.  We  support  the \nexpansion of the body. We have submitted our proposed amendment (Exhibit E). \n \nJARON HILDEBRAND (Nevada State Medical Association): \nWe are neutral on A.B. 348. We echo the comments of the former testifiers. \nWe would like to see our seat remain on the Commission. We do not agree with \nthe  initiatives  Assemblywoman  Carlton  is  putting  before  us.  With  our \n2,000 physician members and their unique patient mix, I feel we also would \nbring value to the Commission, in addition to a federally qualified healthcare \nphysician,  and  bring  other  perspectives  throughout  the  State  and  a  broad \nspectrum of healthcare policies.  \n \nDORA MARTINEZ (Nevada Disability Peer Action Coalition): \nWe support A.B. 348. We ditto the remarks previously made by the supporting \ntestifiers.  \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN CARLTON: \nI found the neutral testimony quite unique. I did not get this neutral testimony in \nthe Assembly. There was one person with the health plans that did testify in \nneutral. I heard from PhRMA today in the hallway, and Mr. Ross shared his \nconcerns by text with me late this morning. You see the bill right now in a good \nposition. I did amend the bill in the Assembly. Assemblywoman Robin L. Titus \nbrought up a valid concern, and we did amend it, but the bill still did not get her \nvote. I am finished amending the bill. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe will now close the hearing on A.B. 348. We have reached the point in the \nSession where it is important that we move things along relatively quickly, so it \nis my intention to have a work session for the bill today.  \n \nI have been relatively involved with the Patient Protection Commission since it \nwas first created. The Commission bill originated in the Senate last Session, and \nI worked closely at that time with Alison Combs to figure out what might work. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 18, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nThe model was to throw stakeholders, who are not always on the same page, in \na room for a while and see if we could come up with solutions where everyone \nhad  significant  buy-in.  Both  of  the  bills  that  came  out  of  the  Commission \noriginated in the Senate this time, and I probably have spent more time working \non the Commission bills in this Legislative Session than I have combined on all \nof my own personal bills. I am not sure it is working. A lot of people put in a lot \nof hard work to try and make it work. I am not casting any aspersions. There \nhave been good and sincere efforts.  \n \nI thank Ms. Cholhagian for the significant time, energy and work she has put in. \nShe has done an excellent job as the Executive Director. I am okay with trying \nsomething new to get more of the patient advocate voice involved. I may have \na bias coming from the nonprofit sector.  \n \nNonprofit and for-profit hospitals have far more in common. A small business \nand  small  nonprofit  have  more  in  common,  and  a  large  business  and  large \nnonprofit have more in common. The nonprofit hospitals are dealing with all the \nsame cost management and insurance. The only thing they are not dealing with \nis trying to pay attention to the profits for the shareholders. That is my personal \nopinion. I am ready to support this and try something new.  \n \nI have been relatively engaged in this process and have tried to be a good \nneutral player to continue to move things along, but I hope that whether you \nhave a seat on the board or not, everyone stays engaged and we continue to \nfigure out how to work together as people who care about advancing health \ncare. I will be supporting this bill in its current form. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nI appreciate Assemblywoman Carlton's policy take on the changes she wants to \nmake. Taking out the voice of some of the most significant payers within the \nhealthcare system is a problem as well as some of the significant cost drivers. \nThis is more of a philosophical difference, so for now I will be voting no. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWe are not doing ourselves a service to have diversity in the representation and \nmore than just one diversity. I would look forward to these meetings to see how \nthis particular body can increase the number of physicians we have in the State \nof  Nevada.  This  is  a  glaring  problem,  and  we  hope  this  particular  body \naddresses that. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 18, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \n  SENATOR SPEARMAN MOVED TO DO PASS A.B. 348. \n \n  SENATOR HARRIS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED.

This  is  my  third  Session  on  the  Health  and  Human \nServices  Committee,  and  each  Session  I  had  Senator  Hardy  and \nSenator Spearman with me. We are losing some great people to term limits this \nyear. Given this could be the last opportunity, I will have Senator Hardy Chair \nthis Committee meeting. \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nI will open the hearing on Assembly Bill (A.B.) 216. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 216 (1st Reprint): Requires Medicaid to cover certain services \nfor persons with cognitive impairments. (BDR 38-385) \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN MICHELLE GORELOW (Assembly District No. 35): \nI am here today to present A.B. 216. This bill mandates the State Plan for \nMedicaid  to  include  coverage  for  cognitive  assessment  and  care  planning \nservices  provided  to  persons  with  symptoms  of  cognitive  impairment—this \nwould include Alzheimer’s or dementia. \n \nAlzheimer’s disease is the single most expensive disease in the U.S., outpacing \nthe  cost  of  cancer  and  heart  disease.  An  analysis  by  the  Alzheimer’s \nAssociation calculated the direct cost posed to caregivers totaled $305 billion in \n2020, and the Association also estimates that Medicare and Medicaid covers \n67 percent of the total cost. \n \nThere are several early intervention and detection strategies that can avoid the \nastronomical  expenses  associated  with  late-stage  dementia  and  Alzheimer’s. \nThe  Milken  Institute  released  a  report  showing  early  diagnosis  in  the  mild \ncognitive impairment stage could create cost savings as much as $7.9 trillion in \nU.S.  health  and  long-term  care  expenditures  by  enabling  better  planning, \nmanagement and care. \n \nAssembly Bill 216 requires the State Plan for Medicaid cover the nonfederal \nshare  for  cognitive  assessment  and  care  planning  services  for  persons  with \ncognitive impairment symptoms. By funding assessments and care planning, we \ncan  get  ahead  of  cognitive  decline  to  ensure  those  suffering,  and  their \ncaregivers can manage the devastation of cognitive impairment. For families \nwith members who may have Alzheimer’s, this bill will ensure support services \nare in place as the disease progresses. This type of advanced care planning can \nprevent acute hospitalizations that can be traumatic for individuals and their \nfamilies and generate unnecessary expenses to the healthcare system.  \n \nMARY LIVERATTI (Nevada Commission on Aging): \nI  am  a  volunteer  with  the  Alzheimer’s  Association,  AARP  and  the  Nevada \nCommission on Aging, today representing the Nevada Commission on Aging. \nThis bill will allow families with members suffering from cognitive impairment \nmore time with physicians to do a thorough assessment and diagnosis and help \nwith care planning.  \n \nDementia is not just for seniors. Although we normally think of it as a disease of \npeople over 65, the Alzheimer’s Association estimates 5 percent of those with \ndementia have the young-onset form of Alzheimer’s—this is 200,000 people in \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nthe U.S. According to data from Medicaid, between fiscal year 2016 and 2020, \nover  4,000  individuals  under  65  already  in  the  Medicaid  program  had  a \ndiagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease or another dementia. \n \nDementia  is  more  prevalent  for  individuals  65  and  older.  According  to  a \n2015 survey  conducted  by  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services \n(DHHS), Nevada shows 16 percent, or 1 in 6 Nevadans between the ages of \n45 and 64 reported worsening confusion and memory loss we call subjective \ncognitive decline (SCD). This condition is associated with later development of \ndementia,  and  nearly  half  of  the  people  in  this  survey  had  not  talked  to  a \nhealthcare professional about their concerns. \n \nNot all people who experience or report SCD go on to develop dementia or need \nthis  comprehensive  service.  A  review  of  pertinent  research  conducted  by \ngraduate  students  at  the  University  of  Nevada  Reno,  School  of  Medicine, \nSanford Center for Aging found between 5 percent and 8 percent of those who \nreport SCD do develop mild cognitive decline or dementia. \n \nEarly and accurate diagnosis is important because young-onset dementia affects \nwork,  finance  and  family.  Many  times  people  are  still  employed  when  they \ndevelop dementia, and early and accurate diagnosis is crucial to rule out other \npotentially treatable conditions. To get the most appropriate treatment early in \nthe disease process is important. \n \nOne day my father believed there was an intruder in his home and called the \npolice. The police came; he did not believe they were the police and would not \nlet them enter his home. I spoke with a member of the Alzheimer’s Association \nwho told me dementia does not usually present this quickly and I should take \nhim to see a doctor. It turned out my father had a urinary tract infection which \ncaused the confusion and delusion, and he was diagnosed and provided with \nthe correct medication. It is important we have the correct screening because \nsometimes symptoms may not be dementia and can be treated appropriately. \n \nEarly and accurate diagnosis gives patients and their families more time to make \nimportant decisions about financial and legal issues. It allows individuals time to \nwork with their employers on work accommodations, disability coverage or early \nretirement options. It allows individuals to apply for disability insurance and \nsupplemental income benefits from the Social Security Administration. It allows \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nindividuals to access clinical trials ongoing across the Country. We will only find \na cure with research.  \n \nThe service we are asking for is already covered by Medicare and Tricare, and \nwas added to those programs in 2018. While Nevada Medicaid does not cover \nit, there are 15 other states that have this service. We feel there is future cost \nsavings through the Social Security Administration which has, for young-onset \nAlzheimer’s disease, a condition under its Compassionate Allowances program \ngiving anyone with the disease an expedited access to social security disability \ninsurance and supplemental security income (SSI).  \n \nThis can lead to significant savings to the State and our Medicaid program. \nAfter  a  two-year  waiting  period,  individuals  on  SSI  can  become  eligible  for \nMedicare.  This  shifts  the  medical  cost  from  Medicaid  to  the  fully  federally \nfunded Medicare program leading to future savings. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThere is a rare disease called Lewy body dementia. I am unaware if we have \nfound anything to help those with this disease.  \n \nCovid-19 creates brain fog, and we are not yet aware of the side effects from \nthis.  Are  there  any  studies  looking  into  how  this  might  link  to  early-onset \ndementia or Alzheimer’s? \n \nMS. LIVERATTI: \nThink of dementia as vegetables. Lewy body, Alzheimer’s, frontal and temporal \nissues are like carrots, celery and potatoes. Dementia is the overarching disease. \nWe are doing research, but I have not heard anything specific to Covid-19. I had \ncancer and went through chemotherapy and experienced brain fog associated \nwith that.  \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nIf they are not doing research on this, it may be worthwhile to do so because \nwe do not know enough about the long-term effects of the virus. \n \nAMY PETERSON: \nMy husband, Drew, celebrated his forty-seventh birthday living his dream as a \n737 captain for a major airline. He had a degree in engineering and owned, \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nrestored and maintained a fleet of vintage airplanes. He was an accomplished \nwoodworker, avid reader, traveler and history buff.  \n \nA month after his birthday, he surrendered his pilot’s license knowing he could \nno longer fly because he was making poor decisions. He was having trouble \nwith numbers, and there were things he was experiencing he knew were not \nnormal. I continued teaching for three years after his diagnosis, but when I \ncame home I never knew whether my husband would be Dr. Jekyll or Mr. Hyde. \nThe mood swings were increasing and depression was setting in, but he was \nvery good at hiding and compensating for his condition. \n \nI knew Alzheimer’s ran in his family but never imagined it would present in a \n47-year-old healthy man. His mother had Alzheimer’s and passed away when \nshe was 58 years old. He has two sisters, one of which has passed away. The \nother sister is in the middle to moderate stages of Alzheimer’s. \n \nThree years later, after MRIs, scans and tests, a DNA blood test confirmed a \ngenetic mutation on the 14th chromosome, and another procedure confirmed \nelevated  levels  of  tau  protein  in  his  spinal  fluid.  It  was  official—he  had \nAlzheimer’s disease. They referred to it as apolipoprotein E (APOe-4), a gene \nwhich is a rare form of Alzheimer’s; that presents itself in young-onset and \nfamilial cases. \n \nAfter  the  diagnosis,  there  was  a  flurry  of  getting  the  family  trust  in  order, \npowers of attorney and financial considerations in place for a man who could no \nlonger work. I could not return to work and became a fulltime caregiver because \nhe could not be left alone. He was forced to take medical retirement 18 years \nbefore his planned retirement at age 65. A friend suggested we apply for SSI. \nWe got the neurologist’s diagnosis in writing, numerous psychological tests, and \nfinally SSI was approved, which made him eligible for Medicare. \n \nHe eventually developed blood clots, both pulmonary and deep vein thrombosis, \nand became a wanderer and a fall risk. I was sleeping with one eye open and \nwas myself experiencing atrial fibrillation. The last 18 months of my husband’s \nlife were spent in a nice, clean, safe small group home specializing in dementia \nwhere  they  tended  to  his  every  need,  but  they  did  not  accept  Medicare. \nThankfully, SSI covered about 60 percent of his monthly care and the rest was \nan out-of-pocket expense. My husband took his last breath two weeks after his \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nfifty-eighth birthday. My husband of thirty years was now gone, and I was a \nwidow at 55 years of age.  \n \nI have been fortunate to volunteer for the Alzheimer’s Association for the past \nfive  years  doing  educational  presentations  and  facilitating  caregiver  support \ngroups for the Senior Center for the Southern Nevada State Veterans Home in \nBoulder City. \n \nMy story is not unique and the caregivers I work with share similar stories. \n \nDUANE  YOUNG  (Deputy  Administrator,  Division  of  Health  Care  Financing  and \nPolicy, Department of Health and Human Services): \nA fiscal note was removed because we believe there are savings based on \ndelaying care into nursing facilities and providing other services such as home \nhealth and personal care services. \n \nBARRY GOLD (AARP): \nMs. Liveratti mentioned earlier that dementia is not just for seniors. Alzheimer’s \nand all cognitive diseases can have a terrible impact on people earlier in their \nlives. On behalf of AARP, we support A.B. 216. \n \nMISTY GRIMMER (Alzheimer’s Association): \nThe Alzheimer’s Association supports A.B. 216. \n \nERIN LYNCH  (Social  Services  Chief  III,  Division  of  Health  Care  Financing  and \nPolicy, Department of Health and Human Services): \nWith the first reprint of the bill we have a fiscal note posted with a zero dollar \nimpact. \n \nJENNIFER  RICHARDS  (Chief  Elder  and  Disability  Rights  Attorney,  Aging  and \nDisability Services Division, Department of Health and Human Services): \nThis bill will have an impact on the populations the Division serves. This bill may \nreduce  unnecessary  guardianships  and  hospitalizations  in  our  State,  and  the \nDivision appreciates the insight on the fiscal note. \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nI will entertain a motion on A.B. 216. \n \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER MOVED TO DO PASS A.B. 216. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 216 and open the hearing on A.B. 191. \n \nASSEMBLY BILL 191: Requires the State Plan for Medicaid to include coverage \nfor  the  services  of  a  community  health  worker  under  certain \ncircumstances. (BDR 38-449) \n \nASSEMBLYMAN DAVID ORENTLICHER (Assembly District No. 20): \nI am here to present A.B. 191 which requires Medicaid to reimburse services \nprovided  by  community  health  workers.  By  doing  so,  this  will  increase  the \ncapacity of our healthcare system for prevention and early treatment leading to \nconsiderable cost savings. \n \nJAY  KOLBET-CLAUSELL,  MSW  (Program  Manager,  Nevada  Community  Health \nWorker Association): \nPresenting  this  abridged  A.B.  191  slide  show,  Medicaid  reimbursements  for \ncommunity health workers, (Exhibit B), is a privilege. The full presentation was \nrecorded in the March 8 Assembly Health and Human Services meeting. \n \nCommunity  health  workers  (CHW)  are  community  members  who  bridge  the \ngaps in Nevada’s healthcare system. They come from underserved rural and \nurban  communities  and  represent  the  diversity  of  our  State  in  the  medical \nservice  sector.  Medical  CHWs  provide  education  and  training  for  patient \nself-management and are defined in Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 449.0027. \n \nThe Division of Public and Behavioral Health studied CHW service in our State \nand  found  a  nearly  $2  savings  for  every  $1  spent.  Emergency  room  visits \ndecreased 14 percent, urgent care visits by 6 percent, acute admissions by \n18 percent, and repeat hospital visits by 20 percent when CHWs were utilized \nto manage chronic illnesses. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nAdditional information may be found on the Nevada Community Health Worker \nAssociation, <NVCHWA.org>, website. We have submitted a list of supporting \ngroups (Exhibit C). \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nWhat  would  it  entail  if  we  consider  sharing  the  nonfederal  portion  of \nexpenditures, and who will be paid, the physician, physician assistant (PA), \nadvance practice registered nurse (APRN) or the CHW? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nWe would set this up as a separate provider type. The CHW would enroll in \nMedicaid but would be linked to a physician, APRN or PA. The CHW would bill \nwith the enrollment link and be reimbursed as a separate provider type. \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nWhere does the money go? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nThe money goes to the enrolled provider. That provider could have another \narrangement with the supervising provider who does the billing collectively for \nthe group; this is not an arrangement Medicaid is involved in. \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nSo  the  money  goes  to  the  CHW  under  the  auspices  of  the  license  of  the \nphysician, APRN or PA? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nCorrect. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nWhat,  if  anything,  are  we  doing  to  ensure  CHWs  are  representative  of  the \ndiverse communities in Nevada? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nThere is language in NRS that CHWs must be representative of the communities \nthey  serve.  Existing  CHWs  utilized  through  community  coalitions,  local \nhospitals,  qualified  health  centers  and  grants  represent  that  community  and \nbilingual or multilingual to reflect the needs of the community they serve. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nSometimes, NRS does not translate into reality. My concern would be that if we \nare going to implement this, we make sure to represent the communities we \nserve. We need to be intentional in reaching out to Black, Indigenous and People \nof Color (BIPOC) communities to ensure we partner with the people doing the \nwork due to what happened during the Covid-19 pandemic. \n \nMR. KOLBET-CLAUSELL: \nThis is a concern for the Community Health Worker Association. We do not \nhave a diverse health workforce in Nevada, and CHWs are the easiest to work \nwith. We are starting programs in high schools and bringing in new instructors \nwho represent different communities. We have an instructor from Fernley and \none from an urban Las Vegas community who will start in June. By representing \neveryone in those instructors and the work pool we have, we are able to bring \nin a more diverse workforce that can go on to social work positions or pursue \nhigher nursing degrees. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nAs a State, we might do better by going to the people that know the people. By \ngoing to churches, fraternities, sororities, community organizations and listening \nsessions we can find out what to do differently and how often. We should have \na way to relate to the community to develop trust. My fear is that if there is no \nintentionality about ensuring we are reaching out and acknowledging diversity, \nthis bill will end up the same way any other bill ends; nothing will happen \nexcept for good intensions that go nowhere. \n \nMR. KOLBET-CLAUSELL: \nWe are applying for funding to hire CHWs directly in these communities from \nevery source we can find. We have Covid-19 relief funds specifically targeted to \nLatino and Native American tribal agencies. We are looking at updating our \ncurriculum  by  bringing  in  consultants  from  the  communities  to  review  the \nlanguage and work to address those issues. \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nWhen a PA is working with a physician, there is typically an agreement in place. \nThe State Board of Medical Examiners is interested in what that agreement is \nand that we have an official designation for who the physician is supervising. \nWhat are the ways those agreements have worked or are working? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nMR. KOLBET-CLAUSELL: \nMost states that have CHWs have a more broad supervision provision than what \nwe are proposing. Our conservative method is a great way to start this program. \nThese other programs will use social workers and different provider types to be \nsupervisors. We are not proposing that. We are looking at a structured setup \nwhere CHWs will have a license that has been approved. They will be working \nwith physicians, APRNs and PAs with a lot of support for the employer, the \nCHW Association and national partners. We know CHWs are qualified to do the \nwork and able to connect to the tasks they are not able to perform. \n \nI am looking at the responsivity and accountability piece. We want this program \nto  be  successful.  We  need  more  outreach  workers  to  see  clients. \nAssembly Bill 191 is looking to expand this so we do not demand so much of \nour  healthcare  systems.  We  are  catching  things  early,  teaching  things  in  a \nculturally relevant way in the appropriate languages directly in the communities, \nschools, homes and churches where people live to build trusting relationships. \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nNevada Revised Statutes 449.0027 describes a CHW as an unlicensed person. \nAre you talking about licensing or certifying someone separate and distinct? \n \nMR. KOLBET-CLAUSELL: \nA CHW is not required to have a license to be called a CHW. For Medicaid \nreimbursement, that license will need to be pursued. \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nFor  the  purposes  of  enrollment,  the  CHW  will  need  to  have  a  license  and \npresent it at the time of enrollment. \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nIs there a license under a board and a fee for that license; is this in the bill? \n \nMR. KOLBET-CLAUSELL: \nThis  has  been  created  and  we  are  running  classes  for  the  licensing.  Many \nemployers are using the program even though it has not been tied to Medicaid. \nThis bill is not about creating the program, this is about Medicaid reimbursing \nthe staff serving Medicaid clients. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nWhere in statute does the licensing appear? Does it appear in NRS chapter 222? \n \nERIC ROBBINS (Counsel): \nCommunity health workers are not a licensed profession under Nevada law; \nhowever, CHW pools are licensed under chapter 449 of NRS. \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nWhat defines a pool? \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nPer NRS 449.0028: \n \n“Community health worker pool” means a person or agency which \nprovides,  for  compensation  and  through  its  employees  or  by \ncontract  with  community  health  workers,  the  services  of \ncommunity health workers to any natural person, medical facility or \nfacility  for  the  dependent.  The  term  does  not  include  an \nindependent contractor who personally provides the services of a \ncommunity health worker or a facility for the dependent or any \nmedical facility other than a community health worker pool which \nprovides the services of a community health worker. \n \nIf CHWs are working for another type of facility, they would be covered by that \nfacility’s license. If it is an entity that arranges for CHWs to provide services to \npeople or facilities, they would be licensed as a community health worker pool. \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nThis bill would allow a pool to be paid and the pool would pay the CHW, but the \nCHW would not be an independent other than if they are working under the \npool, correct? \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nIf CHWs are working for a facility, they would be paid through that facility. If \nthey are working for a physician, APRN or PA in their individual capacity, they \ncould be reimbursed through that provider. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nSo the CHW would receive payment from the supervising physician, APRN or \nPA, or the pool? \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nThe CHWs would receive payment from the pool or facility they are working for. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThe CHW models I am familiar with are generally working for agencies including \nnonprofit  agencies.  They  have  to  be  supervised  by  the  list  of  licensed \nprofessionals but not necessarily sponsored by them. The agency would pay the \nCHW and also pay the physician, APRN or PA, but it is not necessarily a direct \npay  relationship  between  the  two.  There  must  always  be  a  supervisory \nrelationship between the two, is that correct? \n \nASSEMBLYMAN ORENTLICHER: \nThat is correct. \n \nMR. KOLBET-CLAUSELL: \nThe certification we have is through the Nevada Certification Board. It is not a \nlicense. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThis is similar to the peer support specialist bill we heard earlier this Session. \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nThe agency or facility would have requirements for whom they employ and \nsupervise. Would the CHW be in a position to receive remuneration through this \nbill for the services he or she provides? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nYes. The step moving forward is a sustainable business model that allows us to \nemploy more critical members of the healthcare team. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nIs it possible to partner with the Office of Minority Health and Equity to do \noutreach and gain cultural competency for the CHWs? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nMR. KOLBET-CLAUSELL: \nWe are partnered with them and are looking at hiring some of their stakeholders \nfor our staff. \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nWe  require  licensure  or  certification,  and  in  this  case,  certification  as  a \nrequirement of enrollment. The physician, APRN or PA is the supervisor because \nthey are the employed agencies, federally qualified health centers and a myriad \nof  Medicaid  providers.  This  would  provide  Medicaid  providers  the  Medicaid \nreimbursement.  The  arrangement  may  be  multivaried  based  upon  current \npayment arrangements. \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nIs there a criteria or curriculum for the CHW before they are hired, or is it up to \nthe facility or agency that hires them to provide the scope of practice? \n \nMR. KOLBET-CLAUSELL: \nWe do have a curriculum with the Nevada Certification Board and are looking at \nupdating  that  curriculum.  Those  classes  are  an  eight-week  program  that  is \nongoing and popular. There are two other programs in the State; one at the \nCollege of Southern Nevada and the other at Truckee Meadows Community \nCollege. All three work together and apply jointly for funding. \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nThis bill will provide a stream of income that will give CHWs the motivation to \nwork within the system and expand healthcare delivery in shortage areas and \nBIPOC communities, and you are committed in that direction. \n \nMR. KOLBET-CLAUSELL: \nThat is true. \n \nKATIE ROE RYAN (Dignity Health-St. Rose Dominican): \nDignity Health provided a letter of support (Exhibit D) from Holly Lyman and are \ngrateful the Interim committee on Health brought this up as one of its issues. \nDuring  normal  circumstances,  we  have  CHWs  and  promotors  out  in  the \ncommunity teaching about disease and chronic conditions. It has been different \nwith the pandemic, but we have been doing it virtually. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nKENDALL LYONS (Children’s Advocacy Alliance): \nChildren’s Advocacy Alliance supports A.B. 191. I am a former CHW for a \nMedicaid managed care organization in Nevada and have seen firsthand how \nimpactful a CHW is to families new to Nevada or the Medicaid system. The \nability  to  connect  directly  with  someone  like  a  CHW  who  understands  the \ncomplicated  healthcare  system  and  resource  landscape  in  Nevada  helps \nminimize the stress that makes accessing health care feel burdensome for many. \n \nIn  my  two  years  as  a  CHW,  I  connected  people  with  their  primary  care \nphysicians,  advocated  for  them  to  ensure  timely  delivery  of  prescription \nmedications and connected them with community-based resources that helped \nto  minimize  the  barriers  to  care,  such  as  transportation,  energy  and  food \nassistance programs. \n \nThis bill will not only save the State money, it will help people; any legislation \nthat can do both is good policy. \n \nLEANN MCALLISTER (Nevada Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics): \nI offer support for A.B. 191 on behalf of the Nevada Chapter of the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics (Nevada AAP). Community health workers play a crucial \nrole  in  the  dissemination  of  medically  accurate  information  to  various \ncommunities.  In  one  specific  study,  research  showed  CHWs  significantly \nimproved  the  health  outcomes  of  children  with  asthma.  They  have  great \npotential to improve key access to health care and increase families’ adherence \nto provider’s recommendations.  \n \nThe  Nevada  AAP  has  more  than  250  members,  most  of  whom  are \nboard-certified  pediatricians  who  provide  both  primary  and  specialty  care. \nMembers  also  include  pediatric  nurse  practitioners,  physician  assistants, \npediatric residents and medical students, all of whom live and work in Nevada \nand have dedicated their professional lives to the health of all children. \n \nJOAN HALL (Nevada Rural Hospital Partners Foundation): \nNevada  Rural  Hospital  Partners  Foundation  supports  A.B.  191.  Community \nhealth  workers  are  trustworthy  individuals  who  share  life  experiences  and \nculture with those they serve. They are trained to navigate systems, such as \nhealth  care,  housing,  insurance  enrollment  and  transportation,  and  link \ncommunity and clinical services to help people in their own communities lead \nhealthier lives and understand disease and injury prevention measures. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, in the rural communities we saw firsthand the \nvalue when CHWs reached out to our migrant farm workers and tribal members \nwith information and education on preventative measures, assistance in getting \ntesting and vaccinations. Reimbursement for these services is important and \nmore affordable than other alternatives. We have worked many years on this \nconcept and urge your support for A.B. 191. \n \nMS.

(BDR 38-849) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN SHONDRA SUMMERS-ARMSTRONG (Assembly District No. 6): \nI am here today to present A.B. 256 which will enable Medicaid coverage for \nnonmedical doula support services. \n \nIn January 1987, I found out I was pregnant with my first child. I was living \nwith my first husband in the small town of Sispec, West Germany, at an Air \nForce  forward  operating  location.  The  nearest  military  hospital  was  over \ntwo hours away in the port town of Gramerhoffen, West Germany. Because of \nthe distance between where we lived and the military hospital, I was given the \noption of either going to Gramerhoffen two weeks before my due date and stay \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nthere until I gave birth or have services at the local German hospital. I decided \nto have the baby at the local hospital.  \n \nI did not know at the time that part of the continuum of care in that region was \nthe services of a midwife. The midwife who helped me was a stout, dark haired, \nno-nonsense woman who spoke very little English. Although she had a firm \ndemeanor, she exuded kindness and competence, which was just what I needed \nas  a  first-time  mother  5,000  miles  away  from  my  mother.  She  provided \neverything I needed at that time. Our first meeting was at my home, and my \nlandlord’s wife acted as the interpreter. My midwife asked lots of questions and \nmade suggestions such as placement of the baby in the window every day. I did \nnot realize Black babies needed vitamin D and sunlight. She talked to me about \nhow to position the baby during the day so he would not have aspirations and \nsudden  infant  death  syndrome.  I  was  able  to  attend  Lamaze  and \nLa Leche League classes in her home. The first floor of her home was padded, \nand a dozen young mothers went there on a weekly basis for this training.  \n \nShe was my rock during the birthing process. Epidurals are not common in their \nhealthcare delivery system, and she helped me get through the breathing and \nconcentration with touch and encouragement. After the baby was born, she \nvisited me every day in the hospital. At that time, new mothers stayed in the \nhospital for six days. This woman, who acted as my mother, made sure I got \nthe best care possible.  \n \nThis story illustrates the difference it can make when a mother has support \nbefore,  during  and  after  delivery.  Today’s  best  practices  tell  us  nonmedical \ndoula  services  are  great  at  providing  support  for  the  mother,  which  is  the \nmidwife’s job, and the physician delivers the baby. When Quentin Savwoir came \nto me with this legislation, the first thing that came to mind was the amazing \nexperience of the birth of my first son.  \n \nQUENTIN SAVWOIR (Make it Work Nevada): \nMake it Work Nevada builds power around economic, racial and reproductive \njustice. Part of our mission is to advocate for the health and vitality of our \ncommunity members, and A.B. 256 is anchored in that intention. We are facing \na national maternal health crisis in this Country  since the  U.S. is the most \ndangerous place in the developed world for an expectant parent to give birth. \nThe reality is even more dismal for Black women who die at disproportionately \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nhigher  rates  than  their  counterparts.  Forty-three  Black  women  die  every \n100,000 live births; this is unacceptable in the greatest Nation on earth. \n \nWhen I first learned of this statistic, it devastated me because I know how I feel \nabout my own mother, and because I could not help think about all future \nNevadans  that  would  be  born  into  this  world  without  their  mothers.  I  was \novercome with grief wondering how many of these children would never know \nthe unconditional love and comforting warmth of their mother. It did not take \nlong to find out the national trends we are facing as a Country are particularly \npresent right here in Nevada. We conducted field research and a series of focus \ngroups to best understand the health needs of our community members.  \n \nOur Black women’s agenda survey of more than 1,000 Black women in Nevada \ndiscovered that more than a fifth of respondents reported maternal health as \ntheir  most  preeminent  and  pressing  issue.  We  also  found  that  one-fifth  of \nrespondents  reported  feeling  they  had  no  control  over  their  bodies  or  the \ndecisions associated with their bodies.  \n \nIn the series of focus groups we hosted, we were able to dig a little deeper. It \nwas in these conversations we learned the troubling realities postpartum has on \nnew parents. The women and birth parents we spoke to talked about feeling \nstressed  and  fatigued,  and  they  experienced  hardships  with  chest  or  breast \nfeeding among other hardships that a nonmedical doula would be aptly capable \nof supporting a parent through.  \n \nIn these same conversations, nearly a third of our participants reported not \nhaving access to prenatal care at all. These conversations culminated with our \ncommunity members revealing doulas would be the most helpful resource during \npregnancy alongside parenting classes and additional resources to help with \npostpartum depression.  \n \nOur  research  and  conversations  resulted  in  the  pursuit  of  this  legislation. \nExpanding Medicaid to provide doula services to mothers and expectant parents \nis one of the best ways to mitigate subpar birth outcomes, ensure new Nevadan \nchildren are getting a healthy and thriving start, and serve as a cost-saving \nmeasure for our State. There is immeasurable value in having support, guidance \nand an ally when navigating the logistics, uncertainty and newness of childbirth. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nResearch has found that mothers and expectant parents who have access to \ndoulas have improved birth and overall health outcomes. Assembly Bill 256 is \ncommunity-driven policy. At its core, it is about the type of future we want our \nchildren to have, one where we see value in their lives before they arrive—one \nwhere  we  ensure  their  mother  or  birth  parent  has  access  to  any  and  all \nresources that can ensure a safe and healthy birth, and a postpartum period met \nwith support and ease instead of trauma and stress. We can do something \nabout this, and we should. \n \nJOLINA SIMPSON (President, Kijiji Sisterhood): \nKijiji  Sisterhood  is  a  nonprofit  in  Las  Vegas  that  supports  Black  and  Brown \nbirthing people through the prenatal, birth and postpartum process.  \n \nI want to talk about the real, intangible and necessary support having a doula \nprovides in our communities. Doulas are a bridge for our birthing families. We sit \nin living rooms listening to the concerns, hopes  and  birthing  plans,  building \nrelationships that connect to the hearts and desires of birthing families as they \nwork  to  bring  healthy  babies  into  the  world.  Doulas  are  coach,  confidant, \nteacher and hype man. We stand beside and hold space for our strong birthing \npeople.  Through  education,  conversation  and  support,  we  provide  vital \nconnections to understanding and navigating the birth process. \n \nDoulas provide support and advocacy in ways our medical system often cannot. \nWe feed the humanness of birthing persons. We care for them in the community \nbecause we care deeply for our community. Research shows doula care can \nhelp  mitigate  some  of  the  negative  social  determinates  of  health,  such  as \npoverty and systemic racism, which can negatively impact birthing outcomes. \nDoula  care  provides  clients  with  a  sense  of  agency,  feelings  of  personal \nsecurity,  respect  and  autonomy.  They  provide  knowledge  transference  and \nconnectedness.  In  communities  of  color,  rural  environments  and  low-income \ncommunities, this translates to better birth and postpartum outcomes.  \n \nUnfortunately, support is not always available to underresourced members of \nour community because the cost of being poor is high and their working dollars \ngo  toward  maintaining  households  and  navigating  tenuous  financial \ncircumstances. Having a doula should not be a luxury.  \n \nKijiji Sisterhood provides a continuity of care that brings community with us \nwhen we step into the hospital with our clients. We also provide support and \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nresources to our clients when they go home. We have eyes, hands and hearts \non our clients. We stand in the gap to provide resources to protect birthing \npersons and their new babies. Because we take time to build relationships with \nclients, we are often the first call when they have questions or concerns. We \nreaffirm  them  as  parents  and  connect  them  with  medical  providers  and \ncommunity resources such as lactation professionals, affinity support groups \nand mental health providers. \n \nDoula work is work. I have been a birth professional in Las Vegas for 18 years \nand have seen families choose unsupported birth and postpartum because they \nwere  unable  to  finance  it.  I  have  personally  sat  in  the  living  rooms  of \npostpartum families with mothers who are exhibiting suicidal ideation, and I \nstayed  with  those  mothers  until  their  partners  could  get  home  and  provide \nsupport. We connected them with emotional, educational and medical support \nand, with their permission, provided reports to their care providers so they could \nbe brought into the loop to support these families. \n \nDoulas  spend  hours  in  direct,  one-on-one  care  with  each  client.  Doulas  in \ncommunities will often reduce their fees or go unpaid to support families at their \nown financial expense. Paying community doulas is one way to support health \nand  economic  well-being  within  our  communities.  Simply  because  birthing \npersons are unable to pay for the expanding rates of private doula care does not \nmean they are any less deserving of this protection and support. \n \nBy allowing equitable Medicaid reimbursement, we can serve our communities \nin a way that is financially viable for birthing families, community and doulas. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN SUMMERS-ARMSTRONG: \nOur next presenter, Lauren Kalogridis, has provided presentation (Exhibit E) she \nwill review during her testimony on A.B. 256. \n \nLAUREN KALOGRIDIS: \nI am a psychotherapist focusing on perinatal mental health as well as doulas \nwith Reno Doula Project and Bright Heart Birth Services. I am also the program \nmanager of Thrive Wellness of Reno’s It Takes a Village program, which is the \nonly  intensive  outpatient  mental  health  treatment  program  in  Nevada \nspecializing in the treatment of perinatal mood and anxiety disorders impacting \nupwards of 20 percent of birthing people. Those numbers are disproportionately \nhigh during the pandemic. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nIn my role at Thrive, I see high rates of perinatal mood and anxiety disorders \nand  corresponding  birth  trauma,  lack  of  social  support  concerning  birth  and \nother factors that doulas can directly reduce and positively impact. \n \nDoulas are key referral resources who send struggling parents to us and link \nthem to psychiatric and medical support, and community resource support they \nneed and deserve. They leverage the trust and deep knowing they have of their \nclients to connect them to the care needed when things are most dire. \n \nBeyond  the  central  goal  of  preventing  human  suffering  related  to  perinatal \nmental health struggles, it is also reasonable to assess doulas pose additional \ncost  savings  potential  in  terms  of  preventing  and  lessening  the  need  for \nadditional psychiatric and mental health treatment postpartum many insurers are \npaying  for  at  great  lengths.  In  this  way,  doula  coverage  is  a  powerful \nintervention, meeting the DHHS triple aim of improving health outcomes, quality \nof care and cost savings. \n \nDoulas offer the continuity of care and strength-based human-centered support \nour healthcare system is sorely missing, a lack that disproportionately impacts \nthe most at risk in our communities including folks on Medicaid. The expansion \nof  Medicaid  coverage  in  Nevada  would  benefit  all  parties  involved  from \nhealthcare providers looking to improve birth outcomes, overextended nurses on \nlabor  and  delivery  floors,  insurers  looking  for  cost-saving  opportunities  and \ndoulas hustling out of pocket to ensure people in their communities have access \nto the support they deserve. All birthing people deserve to have experiences \nthat are supportive, safe and dignified. \n \nCHAIR HARDY: \nWe have information on Cost Savings for Medicaid Programs (Exhibit F) and a \nSummary of Doula State Savings (Exhibit G) that have been provided to us. We \nalso have a negative fiscal note, so this bill will save money.  \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nUnlike the first two bills we heard this Session, it looks like doula services are \nnot no automatically eligible service for Medicaid, and it requires we apply for a \nwaiver. Can anyone available walk us through the process for applying for the \nwaiver and what the conditions of that waiver are? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nThe language in the bill is written as a State Plan or waiver. We do not have to \napply  for  a  waiver  for  these  services  since  we  can  add  this  through  the \nState Plan process and not have that additional financial impact. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nWould the intention be to put this in the next State Plan amendment? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nYes, the effective date is the first of the year. During the Interim, we would \nwork  with  stakeholders  on  a  provision  in  the  bill  stating  we  determine  the \nenrollment based off the work with stakeholders. There are several different \nnational recommendations and certifications we would apply this to. We would \nbuild the State, as well as the corresponding policy, and have that ready to roll \nout at the beginning of the year. \n \nCHRISTINE SAUNDERS (Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada): \nThe Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada supports A.B. 256. Nevada has \nmade a commitment to addressing maternal mortality, but there are still women \nwho have been left behind. According to the National Academy for State Health \nPolicy, Black and Indigenous women are three to four times more likely to die \nfrom pregnancy-related causes than White women.  \n \nDoulas are an effective part of the  healthcare  system. Culturally competent \ndoulas  are  able  to  provide  support  and  care  to  improve  birth  outcomes  for \nwomen of color. Data shows doula-assisted mothers were four times less likely \nto have a low birthweight baby, two times less likely to experience a birth \ncomplication  involving  themselves  or  their  babies,  less  likely  to  require  a \ncesarean section and significantly more likely to initiate breastfeeding.  \n \nMedicaid coverage of doula care will ensure all future Nevadans, regardless of \ntheir family’s economic status, are born with the best possible health outcomes \nand support from the State. \n \nMS. LYONS:  \nChildren’s Advocacy Alliance supports A.B. 256. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nREGAN COMIS (Anthem, Inc.): \nAnthem,  Inc.,  supports  A.B.  256.  According  to  America’s  health  rankings, \nNevada  ranks  forty-sixth  of  the  50  states  when  it  comes  to  women  and \nchildren’s health, mostly due to the State’s low position of population ratios. \nWe also recognize women who are Medicaid beneficiaries are at the highest risk \nof poor birth outcomes in the U.S., and women of color are especially vulnerable \nand face many barriers when accessing doulas. \n \nFor these reasons, Anthem and the Reno Doula Project are working together to \nlaunch a new maternal health project in Washoe County with the intention to \nexpand, making doula services available to our beneficiaries at no cost. As we \nlook for ways to improve Nevada’s maternal health and infant rankings, we \nsupport innovative solutions to improve health outcomes and believe doulas can \nhelp  decrease  mortality  and  improve  birth  outcomes  for  women  and  infants \ncovered by Medicaid. \n \nJIMMY LAU (Dignity Health-St. Rose Dominican): \nDignity Health-St. Rose Dominican supports A.B. 256. \n \nAMBER FALGOUT (Battle Born Progress): \nBattle Born Progress supports A.B. 256. This bill expands coverage for doulas \nand is right for mothers, especially mothers of color. \n \nCHRISTINA HERNANDEZ: \nI urge the committee to support A.B. 256. \n \nEMILY BARNEY: \nI work as a birth and postpartum doula with Bright Heart Birth Services, the \nReno Doula Project and as a member of the Washoe County Doula Pilot Program \nsponsored  by  Anthem.  I  am  a  voice  of  many,  and  everyone  has  done  an \nincredible job of advocating for doulas in the community. I support A.B. 256, \nespecially for families of color who have not had access to doulas for far too \nlong and need more resources to improve their birth outcomes and decrease the \nlikelihood of negative birth outcomes in the maternal mortality crisis. \n \nSARAH GEOWALTON (Bright Heart Birth Services; Truckee Meadows BirthNetwork; \nReno Doula Project): \nI am the sitting Director at Reno Doula Project which started in 2012 as a way \nto  help  parents  access  doula  support.  Historically,  having  a  doula  was \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \nsomething only people of privilege were allowed to access. The Reno Doula \nProject’s  mission  is  to  close  the  gap,  placing  the  cost  of  a  doula  on  an \nincome-based sliding scale to ensure families of all income levels are able to hire \na doula. This is an important and personal goal of mine.  \n \nThere is no doubt that doulas provide a necessary service. Birthing people who \nhave doulas attend their births have lower rates of unnecessary interventions \nduring labor and higher rates of birthing satisfaction. \n \nIn addition to the Reno Doula Project, I am a birth and postpartum doula, a \ncertified childbirth educator, owner of a local family resource center and the \nowner of Bright Heart Birth Services. Bright Heart works tirelessly to make the \nrole of doula legitimate within the field. We are not medical professionals, but \nwe are professionals. Careful attention to scope of practice, continued training \nand commitment to our clients before, during and after labor has paved the path \nfor doulas to be well regarded in my community. \n \nI support A.B. 256, doulas at more births, and including doula services into \nMedicaid-covered benefits Statewide for Nevadans. \n \nJENNA COLE: \nI am a postpartum doula for Bright Heart Birth Services and support A.B. 256. \n \nKATIE NEASE (Health Plan of Nevada): \nHealth Plan of Nevada supports A.B. 256. Our focus and commitment is helping \npeople  in  the  community  overcome  health  disparities  and  improve  birth \noutcomes.  This  month,  as  part  of  this  effort,  we  launched  a  doula  pilot  in \nClark County to provide peer support to pregnant women through pregnancy, \ndelivery  and  postpartum.  We  are  working  in  collaboration  with \nobstetrician-gynecologist providers to assemble this birth team. Our aim is to \nsurround the expectant mother with support to meet her physical, emotional \nand psychosocial needs. \n \nAs  we  began  having  these  conversations  with  doula  organizations  in  the \ncommunity, the cost of training and certification was identified as a barrier. To \naddress  this  barrier  and  support  diversity  in  the  workforce,  we  provide \nscholarships to novices to become trained, certified doulas. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \nMS.

COHEN (Assembly District No. 29): \nI am here to present A.B. 192 which came out of the Legislative Committee on \nHealth  Care  from  the  2019-2020  Interim.  Two  of  the  priorities  for  that \nCommittee were public and maternal child health, and this bill addresses both. \n \nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sexually \ntransmitted diseases can cause pregnancy complications and result in serious \nconsequences  for  the  mother  and  the  developing  baby.  In  2019,  the  CDC \nidentified  newborn  deaths  from  syphilis  as  “the  most  alarming  threat”  and \nemphasized the need to test all pregnant women for syphilis in line with CDC \nrecommendations. In 2018, we had the highest rates of primary and secondary \nsyphilis in the Nation. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 25, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \nThis problem is acute in the Las Vegas, Henderson and Paradise region which \nhad the highest rates of primary and secondary syphilis in all metropolitan areas \nthat report to the CDC. We also had the second highest rate in congenital \nsyphilis, which is when a mother with syphilis passes the infection on to her \nbaby during pregnancy. \n \nUnfortunately,  trends  have  not  been  moving  in  the  right  direction  for  us. \nAccording  to  the  CDC,  Nevada  saw  a  289  percent  increase  in  congenital \nsyphilis between 2015 and 2018. Congenital syphilis can significantly affect a \nbaby’s health. It can cause miscarriage, stillborn births, prematurity, low birth \nweight or death. Up to 40 percent of babies born to women with untreated \nsyphilis may be stillborn or die from the infection as a newborn. Congenital \nsyphilis can also result in deformed bones, enlarged liver and spleen, brain and \nnerve problems, and a host of other health issues. \n \nThe good news is that both syphilis and congenital syphilis are preventable. \nSyphilis can be treated and cured with antibiotics, and congenital syphilis can \nalso be treated. Babies who have it need to be treated as soon as possible to \nreduce their risk of serious conditions. \n \nThe key to treatment and prevention are ensuring mothers are tested for syphilis \nand  receive  prenatal  care  as  necessary.  Assembly  Bill  192  aims  to  align \nNevada’s  sexually  transmitted  disease  testing  requirements  with  CDC \nrecommendations. \n \nBRADLEY  MAYER  (Southern  Nevada  Health  District;  Washoe  County  Health \nDistrict): \nThis is an important bill, and both Southern Nevada and Washoe County Health \nDistricts support A.B. 192. We heard about Nevada’s battle with syphilis, and \nour sexually transmitted disease rates are high across the board. Nevada is first \nfor primary and secondary syphilis and second for congenital syphilis. There is \nmore that needs to be done overtime, and we will need to continue to take a \nlook at this. \n \nMS. LYNCH: \nThe Aging and Disability Services Division is neutral on A.B. 192.

The purpose of this bill is to increase \ntransparency  for  consumers  of  cannabis  products  in  Nevada.  The  Cannabis \nCompliance Board has the authority to develop and publish data collected via \nthe seed-to-sale software known as Metrc. \n \nLaboratory data is one of the most important subsets of data available through \nthe Metrc program. Laboratory data tells us the level of tetrahydrocannabinol in \neach batch of tested product, as well as potential contaminants such as mold or \ntoxins, and is used to ensure customer safety. \n \nSince  the  inception  of  the  medical-  and  recreational-use  regulations,  the \nrespective regulatory and compliance agencies have set standards for cannabis \nproducts verified through licensed independent laboratories. The results of these \nlaboratory tests are available upon request by the consumer; however, there is \nno  way  to  receive  a  complete  set  of  laboratory  analysis  of  products  from \nproducers that is readily available or accessible by the public. \n \nI am a data nerd and can take raw data and make it statistically significant, run \ntrends and analysis, and describe those things in a report. However, that is \nsometimes not the best way for the public to obtain this information. We are \nlooking at a data process that publishes metric data so the public has access to \nall of that data in one place. \n \nWe are just starting to scratch the surface on the value of data in this body and \nthe  stories  that  data  can  tell  us.  In  this  industry,  accessing  the  data  can \nsafeguard  consumers  from  inadvertently  consuming  products  they  may  not \nwant to consume. It may also tell stories about producer practices such as \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 27, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nshopping  for  results—and  inconsistency  in  laboratory  results  can  expose \ndangerous practices of analytical manipulation—which can potentially put the \npublic in harm. \n \nSection  1  proposes  a  database  be  developed  that  contains  all  laboratory \ninformation related to cannabis products sold in Nevada. In the Assembly, we \namended it to ensure this was in a readily accessible format so anyone can \ndownload the Metrc sheets. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWere sections 1 and 2 deleted by amendment? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS: \nYes. Sections 1 and 2 were deleted by amendment. \n \nWe want this in an accessible format the public can access any time to pull data \nfrom different producers and licensed entities in Nevada. \n \nWILL ADLER (Scientists for Consumer Safety): \nScientists for Consumer Safety supports A.B. 149.  \n \nTYLER KLIMAS (Executive Director, Cannabis Compliance Board): \nI  would  like  to  verify  that  I  have  the  right  bill,  the  first  reprint,  deleting \nsections 1 and 2. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThat is correct, sections 1 and 2 were deleted. \n \nI will entertain a motion on A.B. 149. \n \nSENATOR HARDY MOVED TO DO PASS A.B. 149. \n \n  SENATOR SPEARMAN SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \n  THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 27, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 149 and open the hearing on A.B. 358. \n \nASSEMBLY  BILL  358  (1st  Reprint):  Enacts  provisions  to  improve  access  to \nMedicaid for persons released from incarceration. (BDR 38-919) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN ROCHELLE T. NGUYEN (Assembly District No. 10): \nI am here to present A.B. 358 which improves access to Medicaid for people \nrecently  released  from  prison.  The  intent  of  this  bill  is  to  improve  care \ntransitions to the community for incarcerated individuals eligible for Medicaid.  \n \nIndividuals who are incarcerated in our prisons often have significant physical \nand  mental  healthcare  needs.  They  may  experience  chronic  and  infectious \ndiseases, such as hepatitis C, and may suffer from severe mental health and \nsubstance abuse disorders at a much higher rate than our general population. \nThe Covid-19 pandemic showed us how vulnerable many of these individuals \nare. Many have suffered this horrible disease while incarcerated when we had \nsevere outbreaks in our prisons. \n \nWe want to improve health care for all individuals recently released from prison. \nThis action will help to improve the overall health in our communities, lower the \nspending on State health care and potentially advance public safety goals such \nas successful reentry reducing recidivism. \n \nWe  have  many  individuals  in  our  criminal  justice  system  who  qualify  for \nMedicaid since Nevada expanded eligibility for low-income adults through the \nAffordable Care Act. Medicaid plays a key role in providing support for these \nindividuals. Many incarcerated individuals are often disproportionately poor and \npeople of color. This bill helps to address their healthcare needs while advancing \nhealth and racial equality in Nevada. \n \nIn 2019, 43 states had a policy to suspend Medicaid eligibility for an individual \nwhile in prison, and 42 states had a policy to suspend eligibility for an eligible \nperson while in jail. Six additional states are considering what this bill provides \nwhich is to suspend rather than terminate Medicaid for a person who is sent to \nprison. \n \nOne of the most significant numbers shows we terminate Medicaid while an \nindividual is in prison. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 27, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nhas worked closely with our jails in the State. We have been able to provide \nassistance for individuals to sign up for Medicaid upon release from jail but have \nnot had the same success for individuals in prison. \n \nWhen an individual in prison on medication is released, we are using State funds \nto cover his or her prescription costs upon release. Richard Whitley has provided \nus  with  information  showing  $56,000  in  cash  payments  paid  for  a \n30-day supply of prescriptions for individuals upon their release. \n \nThis bill will help keep our community safe. We have people being released from \nour prisons. Having access and continuity of mental and physical health care \nupon release will make them more successful as they enter back into society. \n \nRICHARD R. WHITLEY, M.S. (Director, Department of Health and Human Services): \nA corrections outreach dashboard (Exhibit B) is a statement showing how many \npeople, by prison, are discharged each month, and how many are enrolled in \nMedicaid.  This  information  current  to  March  of  2021  shows  zero  people \nenrolled. The DHHS has tried to come up with strategies that may work better \noutside the Department of Corrections (DOC) by offering computers that could \nbe accessed and applications submitted for Medicaid; so far, we have not been \nsuccessful. We have offered to complete enrollment by sending staff as we do \nin  the  jails.  When  people  leave  jail,  we  see  police  interacting  with  these \nindividuals, so we have the experience of real-time impact. \n \nThis is important work, and DHHS supports the bill. People in corrections are \nassessed for medical and mental health conditions, treated while incarcerated \nand  given  30  days  of  medication  upon  release.  This  dashboard  is  a  good \nframework for us to continue to monitor this information as we individually \nenroll. If the bill for the all-payer claims database passes, we can show what \nhealth care people access and what the outcomes are.  \n \nWe are in a request-for-proposal process for managed care. With the expansion \nof Medicaid, Clark and Washoe Counties are primarily managed care for the \nnewly eligible individuals, and most inmates released will be newly eligible. We \nhave added an incentive in the request for proposal to score more points on \nhow people would deal with the criminal justice-involved population. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 27, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nIs there any way to ensure individuals in solitary confinement can access mental \nhealth  treatment  and  Medicaid?  Data  shows  that  when  an  individual  is  in \nsolitary confinement for any more than three days, it is like going into combat \nand people end up with post-traumatic stress disorder. If individuals are released \nafter 60 days in solitary confinement, we have a problem.  \n \nMR. WHITLEY: \nThis bill has the potential to be incremental policy-making in that several states, \nUtah the most recent, have applied for a waiver from the Centers for Medicare \n& Medicaid Services to allow for Medicaid to be implemented 30 days prior to \nrelease so there is an overlap while the inmate is incarcerated. That will drive \nthe standards of care to cross over to the community. The dashboard has the \npotential for us to catch up on both ends with people treated in the community \nwho end up incarcerated and then released. \n \nHAROLD WICKHAM (Deputy Director Programs, Department of Corrections): \nOur seriously mentally ill offenders are no longer held in Ely State Prison. We \nhave  moved  them  to  the  Northern  Nevada  Correctional  Center  where  they \nreceive care and treatment in a mental health facility. \n \nThe  DOC  is  encouraged  by  A.B.  358  as  it  will  meet  the  needs  and  assist \noffenders in successfully returning to the community while creating a better \ncontinuity of care. \n \nWe  do  not  have  solitary  confinement;  we  use  what  is  called  disciplinary \nsegregation,  which  removes  offenders  from  the  general  population  for \ndisciplinary or administrative issues such as having an issue with or facing an \nattack by another offender. Our severely mentally ill patients are all transported \nto a facility at the Northern Nevada Correctional Center. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nYou  say  segregation  is  not  solitary  confinement.  When  they  are  moved  to \nsegregation, how many days are they there and what kind of mental health \ntreatment is available to them? Senate Bill (S.B.) 187 would have required those \ntypes of things, but the fiscal note on this bill was so large it did not pass. I was \ntold they could not do all of the mental health things included in the bill. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 27, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nSENATE BILL 187: Makes various changes relating to the solitary confinement \nof offenders. (BDR 16-170) \n \nMR. WICKHAM: \nThe maximum for segregation is limited to 60 days.  \n \nDoctor David Greene oversees our mental health treatment in the mental health \nfacilities. \n \nWe  submitted  a  fiscal  note  for  A.B.  358  for  staff  to  help  process  the \napplications. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nWho provides the mental health services? \n \nMR. WICKHAM: \nOur mental health services are provided by in-house and contract providers. We \nhave  mental  health  professionals,  psychologists,  psychiatrists  and \nDOC employees. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe Division of Welfare and Supportive Services previously had staff located in \nsome of the correctional facilities, which has not worked out well. Will this bill \ntransfer eligibility services to DOC staff? \n \nMR. WHITLEY: \nThe bill facilitates the application process for the inmate. We will still determine \neligibility at the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWould the staff at DOC be used to help out with collecting documentation or \nother information for the inmate? \n \nMR. WHITLEY: \nYes. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 27, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe have a Senate bill with similar components sponsored by Senator Hardy and \nSenator Settelmeyer. I want to make sure there is no conflict between these \ntwo bills. \n \nMR. WHITLEY: \nI  am  not  aware  of  any  conflict  between  the  two  bills.  The  two  actions  in \nA.B. 358 are for suspending Medicaid eligibility. The majority of inmates have \nnot been enrolled in Medicaid. The focus on suspension is consistent with this \nbill. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe bill you are referencing is S.B. 93, dealing with the suspension rather than \ntermination of Medicaid for ease of continuing after release rather than having \nto reapply. \n \nSENATE  BILL  93  (1st  Reprint):  Revises  provisions  relating  to  Medicaid. \n(BDR 38-193) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN NGUYEN: \nI was familiar with S.B. 93 and have made sure the bills were compatible and \nthere was no conflict. \n \nSARAH ADLER (National Alliance on Mental Illness Nevada): \nWe also testified in support of S.B. 93 and are in support of A.B. 358. I am the \nformer President of the National Alliance on Mental Illness Western Nevada, and \nwe have had interactions with Northern Nevada Correctional Center and had \nmultiple connections with peer support groups under the previous warden. As \nrelated to A.B. 358, the point is that we have worked with inmates, removed \nstigma and helped them understand they have a mental illness and that perhaps \nmedication is necessary to achieve stability and recovery in their lives.  \n \nWe have the ability for inmates to retain stability and support recovery so they \ndo not return to an institution if we can enroll inmates in Medicaid before they \nleave the prison system where they have been able to access a diagnosis and \nmedication. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 27, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nNICHOLAS SHEPACK (American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada): \nEnsuring we have continuity of care from prison to reentering the community is \nimperative. I have the pleasure of interacting with directly impacted individuals \nwho have spent long periods of time in segregation or solitary confinement. I \nhave worked with multiple individuals who have spent over 2 decades in solitary \nconfinement and were released rapidly into society; and some who have spent \nover 40 years in prison. They are released and expected to navigate a Medicaid \nsystem in a world they did not know existed. They are using computers for the \nfirst time; nothing is the same as when they went to prison. \n \nI have seen individuals with major health issues, a sickness, an accident or \nmental health breakdown that led to emergency room care before they were \nable to access Medicaid. This is expensive and confusing for them, and they do \nnot receive the necessary follow-up care. \n \nBy  ensuring  we  have  individuals  signed  up  for  Medicaid,  we  can  avoid  the \nissues of being released from prison after decades. Any barrier we can lift will \nbenefit  those  who  have  been  incarcerated  and  the  communities  they  are \nreleased into. \n \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union of Nevada supports A.B. 358. \n \nMARIA-TERESA LIEBERMAN-PARRAGA (Battle Born Progress): \nBattle Born Progress supports A.B. 358. For many, Medicaid is the only way \nthey can get health care, especially for those who find themselves in prison. \nMany  are  likely  to  be  from  low-income  or  underserved  communities  that \ndesperately depend on Medicaid for health care. This program is essential to \nensure they can access healthcare coverage.  \n \nOnce people have served their time, they should be given the opportunity to \nturn their lives around, and that includes access to health care. Terminating their \neligibility  to  receive  Medicaid  is  a  needlessly  cruel  punishment  that  extends \nbeyond their sentences, setting them up for failure when they return to the \ncommunity. As a State, we should be working to expand access to health care \nfor everyone to create a healthier society. \n \nJOHN PIRO (Clark County Public Defender’s Office): \nContinuity of care is most important. The Clark County Office of the Public \nDefender supported S.B. 93 and also supports A.B. 358. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 27, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nKENDRA BERTSCHY (Washoe County Public Defender's Office): \nI also testified on behalf of S.B. 93 and urge your support for A.B. 358. This is \ngood policy that will ensure people have quicker access to inpatient treatment \ncenters  upon  release.  Unfortunately,  we  see  people  committing  additional \noffenses due to the lack of continuity of care. \n \nJIM HOFFMAN (Nevada Attorneys for Criminal Justice): \nI echo the comments of the previous testifiers. Nevada Attorneys for Criminal \nJustice supports A.B. 358. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 358. I will entertain a motion on A.B. 358. \n \n  SENATOR KIECKHEFER MOVED TO DO PASS A.B. 358. \n \n  SENATOR HARRIS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \n  THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * *   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 27, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSeeing no public comment, the meeting is adjourned at 4:14 p.m. \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nVickie Polzien, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMay 27, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nExhibit  Begins \nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \nLetter  on Page \n  A  1    Agenda \nMr. Richard Whitley / \n  B  1  Department of Health  DWSS Corrections Outreach  \nand Human Services \n "], "2": ["\nMINUTES OF THE MEETING \nOF THE \nASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n \nEighty-First Session \nFebruary 3, 2021 \n \nThe  Committee  on  Health  and  Human  Services  was  called  to  order  by \nChair Rochelle T.

Thank \nyou for joining us, and thank you to our virtual audience watching this online, on their \nphones, or on any other device available to them. \n \nToday we have some introductions, adoption of Committee policies, and a presentation by \nthe staff of the Department of Health and Human Services.  However, before we begin, \nI would like to make several housekeeping announcements.  For those who do not know, the \nAssembly  Committee  on  Health  and  Human  Services  is  scheduled  to  meet  Mondays, \nWednesdays, and Fridays at 1:30 p.m.  I will plan to start on time, so I have asked people to \ngo online early, especially in this virtual setting, because we always have some difficulties.   \n \nThis is a virtual meeting format and meant to keep us safe during the COVID-19 pandemic, \nbut I also see it as an opportunity for members of the public to provide testimony in a variety \nof different ways which they may not have been able to utilize in the past.  Hopefully, as we \neventually move to a situation where we are meeting in person and taking testimony in \nperson, we will still allow some of the public to participate in the new ways we have \ndeveloped around the COVID-19 protocol. \n \nIn addition, any written documentation and committee exhibits can be viewed electronically.  \nYou can also email Abigail Lee, our committee manager, by noon the day before the meeting \nif you would like to submit anything in writing.   \n \nI am asking all Committee members to please keep their cameras on unless they need to step \naway from this meeting.  If you do step away, please let Vice Chair Peters or me know.  That \nwould be greatly appreciated. \n \nThere will be an orderly flow of discussion.  If you have comments or questions or responses, \nplease have them come through me.  There are multiple ways we can communicate.  If you \nwant to send a message to me via Skype, I will recognize you so you can speak, or raise your \nhand if you are having difficulty with Skype.  We will try to be as flexible as possible.  \nI know Vice Chair Peters will also be looking to see if people are motioning that they have a \ncomment or would like to say something. \n \nI would like to begin with the introduction of Committee members and staff.  I will start with \nmembers of the Committee.  Will you briefly introduce yourselves, beginning with my friend \nand Vice Chair, Assemblywoman Peters. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 3, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nI am really looking forward to serving on this Committee, particularly with Assemblywoman \nNguyen as Chair.  I think this is going to be a really great session to talk about issues that \ncome into this Health and Human Services. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI am very excited to be returning to the Health and Human Services Committee.  I have \nserved on it all my sessions except for the last session.  I am happy to be back here, as this is \none of my favorite subjects. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI am excited, Madam Chair, to see that you are the Chair of this Committee, and your passion \nfor all Nevadans is exciting.  I am Robin Titus and I am a family physician with thirty-five-\nplus years of experience in the office.  I also have lots of emergency room experience and \nI am a long-term medical care director.  I gave up those hats, however, so I could be here.  \nThe only thing I am currently involved with medically is as the Lyon County health officer. \n \nI represent rural Nevada, District 38, so a number of rural health care issues have been \npassions of mine and I look forward to solving the problems concerning health care access \nthroughout this state—not just in the rurals, but in urban settings as well.  I think health care \nhas always been a topic that has a wide range of bipartisan support.  There is not a person on \nthis Committee who does not recognize that health care is critical to all Nevadans, regardless \nof where they are.  I am excited about the makeup of this Committee, and I am excited to be \nback.  This will be my fourth time on this Committee.  I look forward to solving some of the \nissues here in the state of Nevada regarding health care.  I am happy to be part of the \nconversation. \n \nAssemblyman Hafen: \nI represent District 36, and this is my second session on the Health and Human Services \nCommittee.  I agree with what everyone else has said, and I am excited to be here.  There is a \nlot of hard work ahead of us. \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nI represent Assembly District 35 in the southwest part of Las Vegas.  In my day job, I work \nfor a local nonprofit organization that provides health care to children.  We emphasize \nchildren with special health care needs.  Prior to that, I worked with maternal and child health \ncare issues, so health care has been very near and dear to my heart for the majority of my \ncareer.  I am really excited to be serving my second session on the Health and Human \nServices Committee and look forward to continuing the hard work we did during the interim \nand last session. \n \nAssemblywoman Krasner: \nIt is a pleasure to be here with all of you.  I represent Assembly District 26, which is south \nReno  and  Incline  Village.    I  served  on  the  Health  and  Human  Services  Committee  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 3, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nduring the 2019 Legislative Session and I am very happy to be back again.  I am looking  \nforward to creating legislation that helps the people of the state of Nevada and improves their \nlives. \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nI represent Assembly District 20 on the east side of Las Vegas, Paradise, and into northwest \nHenderson.  My background is in medicine and law, and I teach at the University of Nevada, \nLas Vegas (UNLV) William S. Boyd School of Law—medicine, health law, constitutional \nlaw.  I have spent a good part of the last several years thinking about how we can improve \nour health care system.  This is my first time on this Health and Human Services Committee, \nbut I served six years on the Public Health Committee in the Indiana Legislature about fifteen \nyears ago.  I am looking forward to working with everyone. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nI am the Assemblywoman for District 6.  I am happy to be here and excited to help in any \nway I can to advance good policy that will assist the folks in my community and all across \nthe state of Nevada. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nI represent Assembly District 17 in North Las Vegas.  I am a retired U.S. Air Force veteran \nand extremely happy to be on this Committee.  I look forward to addressing some of the \nissues involving our veterans and elders in the state of Nevada. \n \nAssemblywoman Black: \nI  represent  Assembly  District  19.    I  am  a  Realtor,  but  I  am  married  to  a  medical \nprofessional—a neurophysiologist.  We have just started a medical business, so I am curious \nand interested to hear what we will be talking about in this Committee.  I hope I can bring \nsome good feedback to the group. \n \nAssemblyman Matthews: \nI represent Assembly District 37 in the northwestern part of the City of Las Vegas.  This is \nmy first legislative session.  It is an honor to be here and I look forward to serving with all of \nyou and working on this very important issue. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThis is my second session on the Health and Human Services Committee.  It is my first as \nChair of this Committee, a role that I am truly humbled and honored to serve in during this \nsession.  However, the role I am most proud of is mother to my two children—my ten-year-\nold  son,  Henry,  and  my  eight-year-old  daughter,  Hannah.    My  husband  is  wonderfully \nsupportive, as are my father, Thang, and my father-in-law, Dale, plus our puppy.  I grew up \nin a multigenerational family.  I now have that in my house, and that is what I bring to this \nCommittee.  We all have challenges we face in the area of health care such as access, and \nI am dealing with it personally with my children and with my elderly parents.  I know there \nare a lot of policies we all care about that will affect families like our own and, hopefully, we  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 3, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \ncan talk about them here.  With all the unique challenges that the last year has brought, I am \nalways inspired by the fighting spirit that Nevadans have.  It is what kept me here after \nI moved here in 1999 and why I have not left.   \n \nWe would not be able to be here without the amazing staff we have in this Health and Human \nServices Committee, and now I am going to introduce them.  We have Abigail Lee, who goes \nby Gail and is our committee manager.  She was born, raised, and educated in the Philippines \nand has a bachelor's degree in business administration.  Before working in the Assembly, she \nlived in the Washington, D.C., area and worked in the private sector—most recently as a \nbusiness operations manager at a Fortune 500 company.  She has also held leadership roles in \naviation and in the hospitality industry and moved to Carson City in 2019.  She is the mother \nof two boys—David, age eight, and Daniel, age six.  Outside of work, she spends a lot of \ntime  volunteering,  plus  hiking,  snorkeling,  and  running,  and  she  has  a  passion  for  the \nperforming arts. \n \nAbigail Lee, Committee Manager: \nGood afternoon.  It is good to be here. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe also welcome Terry Horgan, our committee secretary.  She has lived in Carson City since \n1975, is a retired bookkeeper, and has worked as a committee secretary for many legislative \nsessions, primarily on the Committee on Health and Human Services.  She tells me that she \nloves her job. \n \nTerry Horgan, Committee Secretary: \nHello, everyone. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIf you want to have a meeting with me or you just want to contact me, my personal attaché is \nDielle Telada.  She is a proud Nevada native and a UNLV graduate.  During the 2019 \nLegislative Session she worked as a legislative intern in the Assembly leadership office and \nmost recently graduated from UNLV with her bachelor of arts degree in political science.  \nShe is currently working on her master's degree in public administration, also at the UNLV \nSchool of Public Policy and Leadership.  Prior to the start of the 81st Session, she worked on \ntwo  presidential  campaigns  and  served  on  two  executive  boards,  including  the  Young \nDemocrats of Nevada as the director of expansion, and as second vice chair for the Asian \nAmerican & Pacific Islander (AAPI) Democratic Caucus.  She is also helping with our \nnonpartisan AAPI Legislative Caucus handling some of the cultural events we have planned. \n \nTrinity Thom is the committee assistant for the Committees on Health and Human Services \n(HHS),  Growth  and  Infrastructure,  Legislative  Operations  and  Elections,  and  Natural \nResources.  This is her fourth legislative session and second time on HHS.  She is an enrolled \nmember of the Walker River Paiute Tribe and she enjoys traveling and playing softball in her \nfree time. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 3, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nNext, we will go to some of our nonpartisan staff.  Our committee counsel is Karly O'Krent. \n \nKarly O'Krent, Senior Deputy Legislative Counsel: \nI am an attorney with the Legal Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau, so I will be your \ncounsel for this Committee.  This is my fifth legislative session and my second session \nstaffing HHS.  In the years prior, I staffed the Education Committee.  Most of you are \nfamiliar with the services that committee counsel offer, but if you are not, I will be helping \nwith answering questions regarding bills the Committee is hearing.  I am happy to answer \nquestions offline as well.  I can also help with preparing amendments or mock-ups as those \narise. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nFinally, I am going to let Patrick Ashton, our committee policy analyst, introduce himself. \n \nPatrick B. Ashton, Senior Policy Analyst: \nI work as a senior policy analyst with the Research Division of the Legislative Counsel \nBureau (LCB).  This is my second session with the Legislature.  Last session I staffed the \nAssembly Commerce and Labor Committee.  During the 2019-2020 Interim, I staffed the \nLegislative Committee on Health Care for some meetings and the Committee to Conduct an \nInterim Study Concerning the Costs of Prescription Drugs.   \n \nI hold two master's degrees from the University of Nevada, Reno—one in political science, \nthe other in social work.  I am also a licensed social worker and worked for the Aging and \nDisability Services Division of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) \nbefore joining the LCB.  I am originally from Munich, Bavaria, in Germany, and since 2009 \nI have been living in Nevada for most of the time.  I am really honored to serve as your \ncommittee policy analyst, and I am looking forward to working with all of you.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nKarly  O'Krent  and  Patrick  Ashton  are  valuable  resources  for  all  the  members  on  this \nCommittee,  so  please  reach  out  to  them  as  you  are  looking  through  bills  if  you  have \nquestions about them.  Patrick and Karly are here to help all of us on the Committee \nunderstand and get through the sometimes very complex nature of working through these bill \ndraft  requests  as  we  are  going  through  the  session,  so  please  take  advantage  of  their \nknowledge and resources.  They are fantastic people as well. \n \nOur first order of business today is the adoption of the Committee policies [Exhibit C].  They \nwere posted on the Legislature's website and I believe we had the opportunity to also email \nthem to Committee members.  They are policies I am sure you have probably all voted on; \nthey are very similar to those approved in other committees.  They serve as a complement to \nthe Assembly Standing Rules and the Joint Standing Rules we adopted as a legislative body \non Monday in the full Assembly.   \n \nDue to the virtual format of some of our meetings, some additional virtual meeting policies \nhave been added.  Are there any questions or comments regarding those policies?  I do not \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 3, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nsee any, so I will entertain a motion at this time to adopt the Committee policies for the \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS MOVED TO ADOPT THE COMMITTEE \nPOLICIES  FOR  THE  ASSEMBLY  COMMITTEE  ON  HEALTH  AND \nHUMAN SERVICES. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN TITUS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \nThis next document was on the Nevada Electronic Legislative Information System (NELIS) \nand was probably also provided to you in an email.  I will have our committee policy analyst \npresent the Committee Brief [Exhibit D].   \n \nPatrick Ashton: \nBefore I start, I have a little reminder that as non-partisan legislative staff I cannot advocate \nor oppose any of the proposals that come before you.  I am here to assist the Chair and \nmembers with any questions concerning policies that may arise.  My only agenda is to be \nobjective and provide you with unbiased information.  I am available to assist the Committee \nand its members on any issues related to health and human services.  In addition, the \nResearch Division is available to provide information and assistance on a confidential basis \nto individual members of the Legislature on any topic.  Please feel free to reach out to me or \nany of my colleagues at any time. \n \nYou have all been provided with an electronic copy of the Committee Brief, and you can also \nfind a copy on NELIS.  This brief provides background information on the work of the \nCommittee and policy issues that you may consider this session. \n \nDuring the 2019 Legislative Session, this Committee considered a total of 46 Assembly and \n41 Senate bills and resolutions for a total of 87 measures [page 3, Exhibit D].  Seventy-four \nof these were voted out of the Committee and the Legislature approved 68 measures.  That \nmeans that, of the original 87 measures, over three-quarters of them were signed into law.  \nThough it appears this Committee was quite busy last session, let us see what may happen \nthis session. \n \nPlease turn to the next four pages [pages 4-7].  For the next four months, we can expect \nhearings about many health and human services issues in this Committee, in the Assembly \nWays and Means Committee, or on the floor of the Assembly.  The pandemic caused by the \ncoronavirus disease of 2019, COVID-19, will dominate any measures you will consider this \nsession either directly or indirectly.  For example, you might consider matters related to \npublic health, behavioral health and substance use, access to health care, and prescription \ndrug costs, just to highlight a few of them.  The Committee Brief provides background \ninformation on these highlights.  In the next couple of weeks, we will also hear additional \npresentations from experts on public health, mental health, and Medicaid. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 3, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nI would like to note that a correction in the brief in the Behavioral Health and Substance Use \nPrevention section [page 5, Exhibit D].  The first sentence of that section stated, \"More than a \nquarter of adults in Nevada have a mental health disorder . . . .\"  That is incorrect.  Instead, it \nshould read, \"More than one-fifth of adults in Nevada have a mental health disorder . . . .\"  \nActually, it is 20.7 percent, to be exact.  You will find an updated Committee Brief uploaded \non the Committee's web page.   \n \nOn the next two pages [pages 8 and 9] you will find an overview of relevant audits, reports, \nand studies such as interim committee bulletins that summarize the work of committees and \nstudies during the past interim; reports from certain issues that the Legislative Committee on \nHealth Care studied; and legislative audits from the Legislative Counsel Bureau's Audit \nDivision.  The Committee Brief contains hyperlinks to the reports and bulletins if you would \nlike to dig deeper into certain issues.  \n \nFinally, you will find a separate document in your meeting materials that lists relevant state \nand local agency contacts [Exhibit E].  The agencies included are those that are likely to \ncome  before  this  Committee  at  some  point  during  this  session.    This  concludes  my \npresentation, and I welcome any questions you may have. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDoes anyone have any questions for Patrick at this time?  I do not see any.  As I said, he is an \ninvaluable  resource  to  our  Committee.    He  is  there  to  answer  all  your  questions  in  a \nstraightforward way.  I appreciate all his help in getting ready for today, and I look forward \nto working with him for the rest of the session, as I am sure you all will. \n \nWe will now move into our only presentation today.  I asked Director Whitley to present a \nvery broad overview of the Department of Health and Human Services.  A tremendous \namount of our state budget is related to health care.  We have a wonderful director who \nmanages all this, and I will ask him to introduce himself.  Keep in mind that we do have \nother presentations coming up that will provide more detailed discussions about some of the \nagencies within the Department of Health and Human Services. \n \nRichard Whitley, Director, Department of Health and Human Services: \nI am grateful that the Chair has allowed us to take some deeper dives into aspects of health \nand human services such as Nevada Medicaid, behavioral health, and a focus on the state's \nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \nI plan to show you a few slides, starting with this one [page 2, Exhibit F] which references \nour Department's authority and mission.  We have a population-based approach to health care \nand  a  public  health  approach  to  prevention  and  intervention.    The  next  slide  [page  3] \nsummarizes how the Department is organized into five divisions as shown in the gray boxes.  \nThey are framed around populations served, such as Aging and Disability Services and Child \nand Family Services; and functions, such as Public and Behavioral Health, Welfare and \nSupportive Services, and Nevada Medicaid.  Each of the divisions comes equipped with all \nthe standard bureaucratic components—personnel, information technology, and financing. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 3, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nThe next slide [page 4, Exhibit F] represents the total number of full-time staff in the \nDepartment.  The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) employs a staff of \nover 6,000 and the majority work in a direct service capacity.  This session, there is a request \nfor 288 additional staff—primarily due to caseload growth in various programs. \n \nThe budget is shown on the next slide [page 5].  For fiscal years 2022 and 2023, DHHS \nrepresents 48 percent of the state's total budget; that represents all the funding sources, both \nfrom the state's General Fund and from the federal match.  Within the DHHS budget, \nMedicaid represents 78 percent of the total amount spent.  You can see that DHHS has the \nlargest spend of any single state agency, and that spend is primarily in Nevada Medicaid. \n \nTo frame the high-level overview, I would like to go back to talking about our structure \n[page 3].  When you look at our programs, you have to look at them in the context of how we \noperationalize them in the community and what our role is.  Our role includes the direct \ndelivery of service, the funding of service, and the regulating or enforcement of service \ndelivery.  So we have all three of these components, and sometimes they exist in a single \nprogram.  For example, in public health we only have two local health districts in our state—\nthe Washoe County Health District and the Southern Nevada Health District.  The remainder \nof the state falls under DHHS for public health.  We do have a quad-county collaborative led \nby Carson City, but that is not a health district.  We are one of the few states in the nation \nthat have this model where the state assumes some direct responsibilities for public health. \n \nSocial services are another area.  There are county social services in every county, but they \nplay very different roles.  In Clark and Washoe Counties, child welfare is delivered at the \ncounty level, but for the remainder of the state, the state has oversight for child welfare.  This \nmakes for a challenge sometimes because the same oversight for direct service delivery is \nalso oversight for the entire state.  So sometimes we are partners, but sometimes we are \nenforcement or regulatory in terms of a statewide system.  This is also true in mental health.  \nThe state never formally transitioned, as other states did, from state-operated mental health to \ncounty-operated mental health to community-operated mental health, or certainly not at the \npace the rest of the nation did decades ago.  Until the expansion of Medicaid, the state was \nthe  single  largest  provider  of  behavioral  health  services.    The  transition  to  a  more \ncommunity-based strategy has really developed with the expansion of Medicaid, allowing \nconsumers to have a choice about where they go to get services, and with the legislation that \ncreated the regional behavioral health boards.  Before the expansion of Medicaid, we were \none of only three states that operated behavioral health with the state being the primary care \nprovider.  In Medicaid, this model is primarily a managed care model in Clark and Washoe \nCounties and a fee-for-service model in rural Nevada.  Additionally, there are populations \nsuch as the blind, aged, and disabled that are in a fee-for-service environment. \n \nThe service delivery approach is really complex and costly, both in terms of the vulnerable \npopulations that are served as well as the actual financial cost for that delivery.  While trying \nto reduce the number of people who are uninsured, for the past four or five years we have \nstruggled to really implement health care in an environment that has been made difficult by \nthe notion of repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and even affecting the \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 3, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nexpansion of Medicaid.  As we moved forward to mature our health care system, we had a lot \nof  challenges  along  the  way,  further  complicated  this  past  year  with  the  COVID-19 \npandemic. \n \nIt is important to note that this was already a very fragile environment, due primarily to the \nfact that much of our state is a health care workforce shortage area; access to primary care, \nspecialty services, and even health facilities such as long-term care and hospitals remain very \nvulnerable in some communities.  \n \nDuring the pandemic we have had challenges, but we have also had opportunities identified.  \nWe may have moved more quickly or taken bigger or bolder steps to be responsive than we \nwould have otherwise, but some of these things are too good not to build off of as we go \nforward.  For example, telehealth has really increased access,  especially in the area of \nbehavioral health.  That is largely due to the groundwork that legislators did on framing \ntelehealth.  We were pretty much ready to go with the implementation, including with \nMedicaid, and that allowed us to continue with service provisions during the pandemic. \n \nA second opportunity is the expansion of the scope of practice.  A good example of that is \npharmacists and pharmacy techs as immunizers.  A lot of focus is on the workforce shortage \nareas.  I am happy to share with you, or you can browse around on our website, that we have \na Primary Care Office.  It does the assessment of the shortage areas for the United States \nDepartment of Health and Human Services.  Those shortage areas then become vehicles for \napplication  for  funding  to  become  federally  qualified  health  centers  or  for  health  care \nworkers for loan repayments.  Much of our state is a workforce shortage area as it relates to \nhealth care, but the challenge of producing more doctors and nurses is just that—a challenge.  \nHowever, we have seen some improvement in terms of broadening the scope of practice of \nsome of the existing disciplines.  Discussions are always tense when it comes to licensing \nboards and scopes of practice, but I think we have seen some benefit, especially in the area of \nvaccinators. \n \nThe third area we have seen an opportunity for growth in is data analytics.  Those of you who \nsit on the budget committee will note that one of the few moves we are making within our \nDepartment this legislative session is the request to move data analytics under my office.  \nData analytics, much like financing, is usually categorical.  We have programs that may \ncome with a federal grant and have all the bells and whistles for data analytics, and then we \nhave other programs that are largely reliant on the State General Fund that have very little in \nterms of capability for data analytics.  I am most proud of the work of Kyra Morgan, our state \nbiostatistician.  If you look on the website for the COVID-19 tracker, Nevada early on scored \nan A+ compared to other states with our transparency and data, largely due to the work of our \nstate biostatistician and her staff.  It is not just data for the sake of data, but it is really the \nanalytics of the data that serves to inform us.  We have utilized that data daily as it relates to \nwho is being tested, who is not being tested, where we are seeing outbreaks, and where to \ntarget our limited resources.  I did not want this to just be an event that occurred with \nCOVID-19, because bringing the analytics together and sharing some best practices as well \nas sharing the dashboarding is really rich. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 3, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nIf you go on the main page of the DHHS website and you look on the right-hand side under \n\"Nevada Health Profiles,\" Kyra created a data dashboard by districts and counties.  You can \npull up your legislative districts and look at the health indicators for the people you represent.  \nYou can also find the health care coverage, the uninsured rate, the insured rate by payer \nsource, and demographics.  It is a really rich tool.  That is one thing that has come out of the \npandemic that I intend to keep pushing.  We rarely ask for general funds related to data \nanalytics because the service line is generally so long.  We know where the need is—in \nbehavioral  health  and  substance  abuse—so  the  idea  that  we  would  pull  resources  for \nanalytics has been too tough to put forward.  But I do think in this organizational structure, \nwithout costing any more money, we have the ability to share the knowledge and capabilities \nfor data analytics. \n \nI had a great conversation earlier this week with Joan Hall, Executive Director of Nevada \nRural Health Partners, the association of rural hospitals—most of which are critical access \nhospitals.  On her web page, you need only look at the tool box she created for data reporting \nfor rural hospitals.  Now hospitals know what they need to report, but what you do not see is \nwhat we do with all that data—how we translate that to information that is actionable.  With \nthis look at data analytics, I am hopeful that I can come before you next session with some \nrecommendations—perhaps even changing some of the reporting requirements.  There is a \ntendency sometimes in government to pile on requirements without pausing to see whether \nthose requirements still serve the same purpose, or whether there might now be other ways to \nget at the intended goal.  This is illustrated very clearly when it comes to data collection.  \nAnd then what do we do with it?  If we collect it, I believe we should do something with it \nthat would inform on strategies for how to either make improvements or go upstream and \nprevent a costly health outcome.  \n \nThose are a few things I wanted to highlight which are the silver lining in our need to do \nwork differently.  As Chair Nguyen said, you will get a deeper dive into Medicaid.  Our \nfinancing  of  Medicaid  is  historically  dependent  upon  the  counties,  the  taxing.    When \nexpanded, we did not change the way we funded it.  Most of you who were serving during \nthe  special  session  know  that  we  initially  came  before  the  legislative  body  with  some \ndramatic reductions because the economy could not continue to support the level of services. \nOur financing of health care is fragile.  We have opportunities with provider fees that are \noptional, but we have not had any providers take advantage of that other than what is \nrequired in statute for managed care and skilled nursing facilities to pay fees.  I feel as though \nour agency had good momentum coming out of the last session, but we have really had to \nfocus.  It has been all hands on deck related to the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \nOne other highlight I should mention is our oversight of health care.  If you have been around \nduring the last decade, you know that Nevada had a large exposure to hepatitis C in an \nambulatory surgery center in Las Vegas.  It has been ten years, but one thing that came out of \nthat horrible event was that we embedded facility epidemiologists, disease investigators, into \nour regulatory agency—the Bureau of Health Care Quality and Compliance.  I am very proud \nof the work Margot Chappel and Lisa Sherych have done to ensure that our health facilities \nare safe.   We  have  had  tragedies,  we  have had  deaths,  but  when you  look at  Nevada \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 3, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \ncompared to other states, we rank among the lowest.  We are responsive when there is an \noutbreak, whether connected with employee training, lack of equipment, or policy.  We are \nquick to get in, identify the problem, and find solutions. \n \nI am very proud of our regulatory environment and that it is not regulatory in isolation.  It is \nregulatory that enters from the belief that we share the same goal—to be compliant.  I have \nnot seen other states operate in this way and not even the federal government where the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services' regulatory arm operates in a silo.  I am quite \nproud,  and  it  was  demonstrated  once  again  in  the  effectiveness  of  the  work  with  our \nregulators to keep our most vulnerable protected in health facilities. \n \nAnother slide [page 6, Exhibit F] lists the bill drafts from our Department that will, for \nthe most  part,  be  appearing  before  you  in  this  Committee.    That  concludes  my  formal \npresentation, and I am happy to answer any questions.  I am also happy to speak with any of \nyou who have bills.  As you see in our organizational chart, we have touchpoints to a vast \nvariety of issues surrounding health care such as financing it, regulating it, and delivering it \nto all populations.  What usually happens in the Legislature is that something may be a great \nidea until it gets a fiscal note, and then the fiscal note becomes the stall.  What I have found \nwhen we reach out to legislators about what they are trying to do is that sometimes the \nprogram may be something we already have, although not in that context.  If you have an \ninterest in an area that would help people, and we have a piece of the program or the \ncomponents of it, we might be able to work together. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThat was a wonderful presentation, as always.  Assemblywoman Titus mentioned that you \nhave  amazing  historical  knowledge  since  you  have  been  in  this  position  for  a  while.  \nReaching out to you, I felt we put a lot on your plate, but I appreciate your willingness to be \nable to make health care accessible and affordable.  One philosophy I have in life and here in \nthe Legislature is that if there is a problem, does the bill actually solve that problem?  I think \nwhat you said is very important:  sometimes there are already solutions out there; sometimes \nthere are already laws out there; sometimes there are already programs out there. \n \nThat leads to the first question I have for you.  On your organizational chart, you showed five \nmain divisions of DHHS.  We always focus on specifics to health care services, but can you \ntouch more on the other social services managed through DHHS?  How many different \nprograms are there within those five main divisions? \n \nRichard Whitley: \nOne that does not get a lot of focus is the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services \n(DWSS).  That is the eligibility engine for multiple services.  I would like to applaud the staff \nwho work in that program.  They are mostly frontline eligibility workers, some of whom \nwere consumers of those services at one time.  Administrator Steve Fisher has created \na pipeline for opportunity for people who may be recipients of some of the services to \nbecome employees.  I am very proud of the work they do in eligibility.  The welfare division \nprovided staff to the Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation during its \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 3, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nstruggles with the application process.  The reason for this is that Welfare and Supportive \nServices has an integrated model for eligibility, so it is an engine that populates whether it is \nMedicaid  or  the  Supplemental  Nutrition  Assistance  Program  (SNAP)  or  the  Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families.  Those are all programs, but they have different financial \neligibilities.  Temporary Assistance for Needy Families has the lowest eligibility—about 100 \npercent of poverty.  Interestingly, during this pandemic we have seen the caseload in that \nprogram go down.  It was lower than what was projected during the last legislative session.  \nHowever, in programs like Medicaid and SNAP we have an increase in the eligibility.  From \na government standpoint, what is most important about this work is how they do it.  They do \nit with a single electronic application, so if people are eligible for other programs, there are \nprompts to complete the application so they do not have to get in multiple lines.   \n \nThe Division of Welfare and Supportive Services went through a lean process and has a \nmodel called \"One and Done.\"  When a consumer approaches them with a need, their \neligibility staff are able to help those people meet their need with their application and \ncomplete the service.  Prior to this, if you wanted to apply for a categorical program you had \nto get in the categorical line.  If there were errors, you had to start over.  I hold this up as an \nefficiency in government that many other programs in other departments could benefit from \nlooking at. \n \nWith food security and nutrition as determinants of health, DWSS touches that area through \nSNAP as well as our Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program.  Food security during the \npandemic has become a real focus area for people who have never had to access these \nsupports in the past.  A lot of people have needed assistance navigating how to get access, \nand then there is the need among older Nevadans to remove some of the stigma.  If I could, \nI would change the title of DWSS.  The term \"welfare\" puts some elderly or senior folks off \nin terms of accessing services such as food.  Senior meal programs are operated in the Aging \nand Disability Services Division—Meals on Wheels—and have become even more important \nas senior centers closed because of the risks and more meals are being delivered.  Our major \npartner  in  that  program—Catholic  Charities  of  Southern  Nevada—really  expanded  its \nprovision of in-home food delivery.  What has been helpful during the pandemic is getting \nsome waivers so people could get food delivered.  Imagine a single mom on WIC:  on the \npublic health side, we ask the mom to stay at home because of COVID-19, yet her children \nneed access to food.  We have had waivers approved by the federal government to be able to \nhave delivery as well as pickup for some of our food programs.   That also helps our \neconomy in retail terms with the ability to make sales.   \n \nIn  terms  of  food  security, those  programs  run  across  our  divisions  but  definitely  work \ntogether.  You might have one family that has a grandmother and a few young kids living \nwith them, and they may qualify for multiple programs.  We work across our divisions to \norganize that and make sure there are prompts for eligibility to any of the programs.  Food \nsecurity has become more of a focus.  Food and housing are probably the two areas where \npeople reach out with the greatest vulnerability. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 3, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nConcerning application and enrollment, there has been a gradual increase.  In talking with \npeople who enroll, their health care is not their primary need.  If you think about it, they are \nlikely not disabled; they had been working but then they were laid off.  It is only when health \ncare becomes a need that some of the folks who had been laid off have been enrolling, so that \nhas been a gradual increase.  We have seen more of a spike in applications for SNAP.  I have \nillustrated some programs across divisions beyond health care, but I would call these all \ndeterminants of health—poverty, housing, food security. \n \nWe have also been enriched by our working relationship with the schools.  I am so proud of \nour relationship with the Superintendent of Public Instruction.  We have reached out to the \nschool districts concerning how to meet some of the behavioral health challenges of kids who \nare being homeschooled and who might need additional help.  The same goes for victims of \ncrime and some of the services people need in that area.   \n \nI venture to say that if it is a social service program, we have a touchpoint to it.  In all these \nareas we look for parity of service.  If we are underserving a population or if there is \noverrepresentation, it is helpful to be able to see what is going on and if we could go \nupstream and address the problem.  In our state, we have a lot of food deserts.  It may be one \nof the weaknesses in the United States Department of Agriculture programs such as SNAP \nthat a liquor store can sell some groceries and qualify to be a SNAP provider, but that might \nbe the only source for retail purchase of food in a neighborhood.  I have identified that as an \narea we could improve on as relates to the food deserts.  There are some models in WIC.  For \ninstance, in Chicago there are mobile WIC stores that go to neighborhoods.  We have had \nsome meetings with Catholic Charities about opportunities in that area.  To come full circle, \nI want to again say food security probably is a pressing topic right now.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you.  I appreciate your ability to see some of the challenges we have had with this \npandemic and that you are using the pandemic as an opportunity to streamline and cut \nthrough some of the bureaucratic red tape we have getting these services to the individuals \nwho need them.  I appreciate your willingness to be flexible and streamline the access to \nservices and also your willingness to share this with us.   \n \nDoes anyone have any questions?  I do not see any.  Director Whitley is a resource, and \ncontact information for the various divisions and agencies is available on NELIS as well, or \nour staff can get it to you.   \n \nI will move on to public comment.  As a reminder, you can always provide public comment \nin writing to the committee secretary.  I think there is one person in the public comment \nqueue.  [There was no one.] \n \nAre there other comments from Committee members before we adjourn? \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 3, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nAssemblywoman  Titus:  Thank  you  for  the  presentation  from  Director  Whitley.    The \ninstitutional knowledge he has to offer concerning how we got to this point and what brought \nus here is quite valuable to all of us.  I would encourage you to reach out to him.  If he does \nnot know the answer, someone in his Department will know.  Getting the history so we do \nnot have to repeat it concerning some of these programs that may or may not have worked is \nvaluable.  It is a big lift for the state of Nevada.  The biggest budget item is health care, so we \nreally need to understand where we send those monies, and Director Whitley is a great \nresource.  \nChair Nguyen: \nI completely agree.  Are there any other comments or concerns?  [There was no response.]  \nThat concludes our meeting for today.  Our next meeting is Monday, February 8.

We are going to take a deeper \ndive into some of the state agencies, so we will turn this over to the Division of Public and \nBehavioral Health in the Department of Health and Human Services.  \n \nLisa Sherych, Administrator, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, Department of \nHealth and Human Services: \nSeveral of us will be sharing today's presentation [Exhibit C].   Moving to our first slide \n[page 2, Exhibit C], this provides an overview of our division's vision and mission.  The next \nslide [page 3] provides an overview of our division's organizational chart, and the subsequent \nslide [page 4] provides an overview of our agency's operations.  As you can see, we are \ncomposed of five service branches—community health, regulatory and planning, clinical, \nbehavioral health policy, and administrative services.   \n \nThe next two slides [pages 5 and 6] provide an overview of our public health program, and \nthe next three slides [pages 7-9] provide an overview of our division's accomplishments.  Of \nnote, I am particularly proud of the work the Division of Public and Behavioral Health has \ncontinued to do related to addressing COVID-19's spread within Nevada's licensed facilities.  \nComparing  the  national  average  of  the  percentage  of  deaths  in  facilities,  Nevada  has \nconsistently been under 25 percent, whereas the approximate national average is 40 percent, \nwith some states as high as 80 percent.  Additionally, Nevada has been under 20 percent \nsince August and, as of today, we are at 15.8 percent.  That is 1.5 percent lower than it was a \ncouple of weeks ago.  The next slide [page 10] provides information on our division's public \nhealth priorities.  Now I will turn it over to Julia Peek who will provide a further overview of \nour presentation. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 8, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nJulia Peek, Deputy Administrator, Community Health Services, Division of Public and \nBehavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services: \nOne  of  the  easiest  ways  to  understand  public  health  is  to  understand  the  historical \naccomplishments in the field.  I have provided a link in the PowerPoint of ten great public \nhealth achievements [page 11].  I will note the top five which the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention (CDC) notes as:  vaccination; motor vehicle safety; safer workplaces, which \nis related to safety in mining, manufacturing, and construction; control of infectious diseases, \nwhich includes clean water and sanitation; and decline in deaths from coronary heart disease \nand  stroke.    This  centers  around  risk  modification  including  smoking  cessation,  blood \npressure control, early detection, and better treatment.  The report goes on to list another five \naccomplishments that range from maternal and child health to other areas.  I encourage \nanyone interested to access the link that has been provided.  That said, even in this top five, \nyou can see the great diversity in scope and responsibility of our public health partners. \n \nThis next slide [page 12, Exhibit C] is a diagram we commonly use to show the public health \nsystem.  It illustrates the diversity of our partnerships in place to address and improve the \nhealth of our residents.  Depending on the issue at hand to tackle, the specific partners we \nwork with can vary.  For example, with COVID-19, there is not one partner on this diagram \nwe have not worked with to address it in our state. \n \nGoing to the next slide [page 13], as we talk again about the scope of public health, it is very \nbroad and flexible in scope and responsibility because it relates to the health of our public \ngenerally.  As a rule, our efforts are driven to understand why people get sick and why they \ndie.  Our overarching vision is for each person to live a long and healthy life.  If we can \nunderstand the health issues in our population and subpopulations, we can try to intervene to \nprevent that negative outcome.  We often find our focus is on infectious disease because it \ncan spread quickly through the population. \n \nThis next slide [page 14] is a model we use often in public health, and we can really speak \nabout the issue as it relates to this.  It is called a social-ecological model and it helps us \nunderstand the many levels of an issue, especially as it relates to population or public health.  \nThis model starts locally with the individual and then there are peers and family.  It evolves \nto the highest level—the influence of policy.  This model helps us understand which level has \nan impact on the health issues so we can develop specific interventions at each of those \nlevels. \n \nThe next slide [page 15] shows an example concerning childhood obesity.  With childhood \nobesity we look at the child.  That child's personal demographics are a primary factor in the \nweight, but we also look at the parents' weight and food preferences in the home.  The policy \nlevel, in that same scenario, is where the larger population efforts occur around childhood \nobesity, for example, seeing nutritional details on food items or on restaurant menus.  Also, \nthe taxing of certain items can change behavior.  Those are all policy opportunities as we \nlook at obesity and healthy living. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 8, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nI would like to speak about the amazing universities in our state, specifically, and nationwide \nas well.  There is great diversity in the field of public health, and what you are seeing here is \na list of the specialties or core competencies that our public health professionals can focus on \n[page 16].  This is truly a holistic approach to addressing public health.  Again, I want to \nacknowledge our universities in the state that have been such a pivotal part of our response to \nCOVID-19. \n \nI am going to provide a highlight and a link on the next slide [page 17].  Public health, like \nall topics, evolves over time.  We are in a period of time coined \"Public Health 3.0.\"  While \npublic health professionals a century ago may have focused on very granular outbreaks or \ncrises, now we function more as strategists to pull partners together to look at inequities and \nopportunities for intervention.   \n \nIn public health, we often get asked about our relationship with health care.  It truly is a \npartnership.  Health care focuses on the health of the individual patient.  We focus on how all \nthe patients together become population health, the health status of the collective group, and \nhow to intervene.   \n \nPublic health is in constant evolution.  With Public Health 3.0, we focus much more on \ncollective impacts and reaching our residents where they are.  We also understand more and \nfocus on social determinants of health that lead to a particular health outcome.  You will hear \nthat  a  person's  ZIP  Code  is  often  more  a  reflection  of  that  person's  health  than  that \nindividual's genetic code.  That is one of the things we look at as we delve into public health \ndata.    For  example,  you  may  have  health  insurance  due  to  the  Patient  Protection  and \nAffordable Care Act, but you might not be getting preventative screening even though it is an \nallowable service.  In public health, we try to understand why that is occurring.  What is the \nbarrier if it is no longer health insurance, and how can we help address any health issues a \nperson might have and intervene? \n \nI am going to transition from global public health comments to concepts about public health \nin Nevada.  Nevada is one of only two states nationally that has a largely decentralized public \nhealth structure.  The bulk of our population is served by a district health department, but the \nstate still provides direct service in many counties.  We have also delegated some authority, \nfor example, to Carson City Health and Human Services [page 20, Exhibit C]. \n \nGoing to the next slide [page 21], the structure and functions of public health are in several \nstatutes, but I will highlight just two.  Those are found in Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) \nChapter 439 and in NRS Chapter 441A.  These have been of particular interest during the \nCOVID-19 response.  You will hear later from our two district health departments that \nfunction largely as independent health agencies, as well as from Carson City Health and \nHuman  Services,  which  operates  as  a  regional  health  department  under  delegation  of \nauthority that is allowed in that law. \n \nThe next slide [page 22] shows the county boards of health.  In this case, I am focusing on \nour rural and frontier counties related to population size in the statute.  Each county is \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 8, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nrequired to have a county board of health represented by the county commissioners, the \nsheriff, and a health officer.  We work a great deal with the designated health officer.  One of \nthe challenges we had, as it relates to COVID-19, is that every rural county looked different.  \nIn some rural counties, there was a very functional board of health that was meeting on a \nregular basis and tackling population health issues locally.  In some cases, there was no board \nof health.  Trying to have that stood up and to identify a county health officer in the midst of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic was problematic.  That said, the counties have moved mountains in \nthis regard, and now that functional necessity of a public health system at the county level is \nincredible.  I want to acknowledge all the efforts there.  They have really stepped up. \n \nThe next slide [page 23, Exhibit C] is a short list of what we have learned.  In public health \nwe have a wide variety of partners we work with when we address a specific issue, but one of \nthe challenges is that we had to become the convener in many cases, not the doer.  We had to \nwork  with  our  counties  and  county  leadership,  but  specifically,  we  had  to  work  with \nemergency management.  That includes people locally including our National Guard and the \nDivision of Emergency Management within the Department of Public Safety at the statewide \nlevel.  They have really helped with the logistics—to operationalize these incredible public \nhealth interventions.  We also clearly identified a need for flexible funding to support a \npublic health crisis in real time and support basic infrastructure.  As you know, our federal \npartners did come through with funding for epidemiology, lab work capacity, immunization, \npublic health preparedness, and other items, but we did function with what we had for several \nmonths in the beginning.  With the exception of COVID-19 funding, we do not have the \nability to address the need locally.  We have many public health crises, but we do not have \nbasic infrastructure funding.  \n \nI also talked about decentralization of public health.  Again, I cannot speak highly enough \nabout how our rural and frontier counties stepped up.  They had no infrastructure prior to the \npandemic, but they accepted delegation of authority from our chief medical officer.  They \nhave shown such great work.  I see great value in watering that effort and continuing to see it \ngrow with other diseases outside of COVID-19.  That will take some infrastructure funding \nso they can set up such structures. \n \nWe try to get as much money as possible out into the field for direct service because the \nfunds are so limited.  As a result, as a division we skimp on our own funding for things such \nas human resources support, information technology (IT) infrastructure support, and fiscal \nsupport, because the need for direct service in our counties is so great; however, that creates a \nhuge challenge for us.  We received $430 million for the response to COVID-19, but as a \ndivision we need to get those subawards out and ensure that the spending is appropriate and \ncorrect, and that is a big ask.  That has been a challenge for us.  I want to acknowledge our IT \nstaff because another huge challenge is that we had a very antiquated system for infectious \ndisease, yet our lab reporting rose 8,000 times above what we were used to, which really \ncrippled our system.  In some cases, we were largely functioning on faxed reports, and that \nquickly became unmanageable.  We have had to use some of the funding to develop things \nwithin our public health infrastructure that will have an impact on all diseases going forward.   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 8, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nAnother major challenge we had was the expectation that we could release data in a day.  \nRelated  to  public  health,  it  is  not  typically  real-time  surveillance,  so  we  were  really \nchallenged.  With HIV data, for example, we take a year and a half to clean it before we \nrelease it to make sure it is the most accurate record on file.  Those are things that were \nreasonable expectations of our community and of people who needed that information, and it \nhas been an incredible lift on behalf of the public health structure. \n \nThe last slide is related to public health funding [page 24].  Each biennium, we report where \npublic health spending in Nevada is ranked nationally.  According to the America's Health \nRankings, we are the least healthy state as far as public health funding is concerned.  Alaska \nis the best at $289 per capita, and Nevada is at $50 per capita.  That said, we have had \ninvestments in the past several years related to family planning, women's health connection, \nand other services, but we are still much further behind than many other states.  One report \nshows that an investment of $10 per person in evidence-based programs can save the country \n$16 billion annually within five years. \n \nAn important point is who benefits most from public health, and it is children, infants, and \nunderresourced communities.  A huge ask of us is to identify inequity and disparities and \noffer suggestions as to how we can intervene and ensure they are removed.  That concludes \nthe Division of Public and Behavioral Health's presentation. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nSome of those numbers were quite impressive.  I like to make a point of highlighting when \nour state is a leader nationally.  Specifically, you mentioned that our numbers were about half \nin the long-term care facilities.  I believe you said we were at 20 percent and even lower \nmore recently.  Can you highlight what we are doing right, and are we sharing these best \nmanagement practices with other state agencies and other regulatory responders? \n \nLisa Sherych: \nEarly on we created what are essentially strike teams.  We have always had an Office of \nPublic Health Investigations and Epidemiology.  We also have our Health Protection and \nPreparedness team and our Health Care Quality and Compliance team.  Early on we made a \nconcerted effort to make sure those three teams were working very closely together along \nwith the facilities to identify infection control issues and provide a lot of technical assistance.  \nWe are coming from the angle of improving a situation rather than taking punitive actions.  \nWe have also done work with the Department of Corrections.  Our staff has been out to a \ncouple of those facilities and has provided information on how they can address certain \ninfectious disease control issues.  I do not have any information concerning sharing with \nother states, but I will check and provide that information later. \n \nJulia Peek: \nMs. Sherych mentioned the health facility epidemiology team.  That is something unique to \nNevada.  We learn from our crises in public health and we developed that team as a result of \nthe hepatitis C outbreak in Clark County.  We knew we had to have a strike team that could \nintervene immediately.  We had that relationship and structure built prior to COVID-19, so \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 8, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nwe were able to make minor modifications to that.  Other states that had not worked so \ndirectly with epidemiology and health care-associated infections had to build that from \nscratch.  That is something we are really proud of.   \n \nThe other thing we learned as a result of COVID-19 is that we were on separate reporting \nsystems at the districts and the state.  Now we are all going to move to the same infectious \ndisease reporting system so we have a standardized way to collect data.  We understand that \ncounty lines are not solid, and we need to be able to see how people go across the state, \nespecially with infectious diseases.  We are learning a lot and making foundational public \nhealth improvements.  I will note that for COVID-19 vaccination, we have the highest \nadministration rate in our region, so we are talking with our regional partners, telling them \nwhat we are doing, and offering suggestions concerning what is working and what is not.  \nWith this crisis, we are a leader in the region. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nAre you collecting demographic information on COVID-19 rates?  How is Nevada looking \nas compared to national rates of COVID-19 infection and deaths in the black communities in \nour state?  I hope we are collecting that data and that you can report that information. \n \nJulia Peek: \nWe are collecting information on race and ethnicity.  We also are one of the only states that \nadded questions related to LGBTQI issues.  We will not know of disparities until we look at \nthe data and see if there is truly a disparity in any areas.  I think we are pretty standard, and \nI am happy to pull that data for you directly.  I would like to explain some of the challenges \nwith public health data in this capacity.  We get that data from lab reports, so the cases you \nsee on the Nevada Health Response dashboard are because we needed it in real time so we \ncould see what was happening with the disease; however, lab reports required by our federal \npartners now often do not have race or ethnicity, so we were going off a lot of data that was \nunknown and trying to investigate those cases so we could get that information added.  It is a \nhuge effort.  I hope our laboratory partners continue to improve in those areas because we \nneed to know what the inequities look like in our community. \n \nWe are also collecting that information related to vaccinations.  The Governor has reported \nthat he is going to focus on equity as we move forward.  A challenge we experience with \nequity  is  that  it  is  self-reported.    Sometimes  people  are  uncomfortable  sharing  that \ninformation, so we have to communicate effectively about why we collect that data and how \nwe are going to use that data.  We are doing a lot of effort in that regard right now, but across \nthe board, Nevada is trying to be as progressive as possible in asking as many questions \nacross all the pieces in the hope that we can find inequities of race, ethnicity, and otherwise, \nand then address them. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIf you can provide any of that data to our committee secretary, we will distribute it to the rest \nof the Committee. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 8, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nCan you tell me, as a representative for my community, what can those of us who are elected \nofficials do to help improve the confidence among our community members to report this \ndata to you so you can have better data to report and collect?  What can we do to help? \n \nJulia Peek: \nYou truly are the champions in the community.  What you say will be heard.  For our part in \npublic health, we will make an effort to get you the talking points and information you need \nto then go champion that back to your community.  I will send information to you all, \nspecifically around vaccinations, but also concerning the importance, in any disease and \ninvestigation, of providing that information to the public health partners and understanding \nthat it is confidential.  It is used by us to bring resources to the community and identify if \nthere  are  disparities.    I  am  happy  to  get  you  some  talking  points  to  share  with  your \ncommunity. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank you to all of you who are presenting today, for what you are doing for the public \nhealth of Nevada.  I know these are challenging times, and it would have been challenging \nwithout a pandemic.   \n \nRecently in the news there has been information about disparity concerning the vaccines and \nwho has been receiving them.  In the money committee, I have discussed receiving COVID-\n19 funds, where they are going, and making sure we have that outreach and trust.  Our \nAttorney  General  made  a  big  point  when  he  got  his  vaccine  because  he  wanted  the \ncommunities to be reassured that it is okay to get the vaccine.  As we know, there is a huge \namount of distrust in the process and, frankly, rightfully so. \n \nMy concern is that there is significant disparity about who has gotten this vaccine.  Is it \nbecause you were following what the Office of the Governor set up concerning different \nlanes and tiers?  In the first tier were first responders, then people over the age of 70 were in \nthe second tier, and there were those kinds of criteria.  How was it decided to give those \nvaccinations?  You were just following the tiers as directed, but has that changed at all, now \nwe know that may not have been good enough? \n \nJulia Peek: \nRegarding funding, the disparities and inequities have been something our federal partners \nhave been emphasizing since the start of the pandemic, and those are reflected in the data we \nhave as well.  Related to the vaccination grant, at least 10 percent of that award has to go \ndirectly to addressing disparity in the community and equitable distribution.  That includes \nracial and ethnic disparity, but also rural residents were specifically called out.  Those are \nthings each of our local health departments will build into their budgets as they spend that \naward.  There is also an equity task force that is a requirement of that award.  In Nevada, we \nare one of the states that developed staffing within the Department of Health and Human \nServices'  Office  of  Minority  Health  and  Equity  from  the  beginning  of  the  COVID-19 \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 8, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nresponse, which has been working with us on testing, how we message that appropriately, \nand now on vaccination as well, as has our coalition.  We will continue to work in that area. \n \nRelated to the playbook, that is such an important discussion and point.  If we looked at \nstraight population distribution, then we would look at the folks within a certain ZIP Code \ngetting the level that is appropriate, based on their overall piece of the population.  As you \nmentioned, that is not how this works; it is related to lanes or tiers.  It has been called \ndifferent things, but we based our playbook and our recommendations on the Advisory \nCommittee on Immunization Practices recommendations and what our CDC partners said.  It \nmight look like there is inequity in certain ZIP Codes or age groups, but it is a result of \nfollowing the playbook. \n \nAnything we present can be improved on, so it is a matter of drawing more attention to it and \nensuring that we have data collected.  This goes back to how important it is to share accurate \ninformation with the person vaccinating you on address, race, ethnicity, et cetera, so when we \npull the data, especially when it becomes more general population-based, that we can ensure \nthere is a level of equity.  The other thing we are doing is looking at how  we reach \npopulations that might have a hard time getting vaccinated, so we will be looking at mobile \noutreach.  You have seen it before with the Mammovan—where we can go to a community \nand vaccinate or test that community with that mobile resource.  It will be particularly helpful \nto target specific ZIP Codes when we eventually get a one-dose vaccine for COVID-19 like \nthe Johnson & Johnson.  Again, that is most important when it becomes a general-population \nvaccination. \n \nWe are working again with equity across the 70-plus-year-olds.  The biggest challenge is the \nsupply issue at this point.  We have a limited number of vaccinations, so it is challenging for \nfolks to get the resource.  Something we have done to implement equity and address barriers \npresented is develop the call line.  Though not perfect, it is getting a huge number of calls.  \nWe are walking people through how to sign up, so if you do not have a smart device or you \nare  having  a  hard  time  navigating  the  website  or  the  various  pharmacy  websites  for \nenrollment, you can call our helpline and we will walk you through.  We are not perfect by \nany means, but we are certainly trying to get better eyes on it and better data so we ensure \nequity at every level we have control over.   \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nTo follow up on that, could you get us some numbers?  Not just on the COVID-19 vaccine, \nbecause as you said, this is a unique situation and we developed the best plan we could.  As \nyou said, it may not be perfect, but there have been some real disparities in getting vaccines \nin general.  We will get control of this pandemic, but we may not necessarily get control of \nthe need to reach out and get more people vaccinated, and not just with the COVID-19 \nvaccine, but with the flu vaccine.  We are at the bottom as related to numbers of folks who \nactually get vaccinated for the flu.  I think only 44 percent of our population gets the flu \nvaccine, so this goes far beyond COVID-19.  What COVID-19 has done is show us the holes \nin our system and bring them to the forefront.  If we could see some data on what the \ntraditional vaccination rates are across the board for all vaccines available and how we need \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 8, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nto do better for all members of our Nevada communities, that would be helpful.  We are still \nlacking on some of these vaccines that need to be given or that people should consider \ngetting.  Hopefully, when we get some of this data you say you are now gathering, we will \nget information about the disparity rates in overall vaccines and who is getting them. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIf Committee members have further questions, I would ask you to reach out directly to our \npresenters, and we can get you their contact information.  The next presentation is from \nCarson City Health and Human Services. \n \nNicki Aaker, Director, Carson City Health and Human Services: \nWe have a county board of health.  Carson City's municipal code, as relates to our board of \nhealth, requires a Nevada-licensed doctor, whereas NRS Chapter 439 does not.  Carson City \nelected to create its county board of health in 2003.  The board of health's composition \nincludes a county health officer, the Carson City board of supervisors, and the sheriff. \n[page 28, Exhibit C]. \n \nWe  are  a  local  health  authority,  not  a  district,  since  Carson  City  is  a  consolidated \nmunicipality.  To be a district, two or more counties or cities need to join together.  It is a city \ndepartment within Carson City.  Our department received public health accreditation in May \n2016 after many years spent working on that endeavor.  The core documents of accreditation \nare the community health needs assessment, the community health improvement plan, and \nthe  strategic  plan.    Some  other  important  plans  include  the  quality  improvement  plan, \nworkforce development plan, risk communications plan, and the public health emergency \noperations plan.  Right now, we are in the midst of going through reaccreditation. \n \nStaffing at the health department before COVID-19 was 38 full-time equivalents (FTEs).  \nCurrently we have 65.5 FTEs.  This slide shows our organizational chart [page 30].  The \ndisease control and prevention division and public health preparedness organizational charts \nwill be on other slides.  The budget for Carson City is $9.4 million [page 31]:  29 percent is \ngeneral-funded; and 63 percent is grant-funded, which is currently higher due to the COVID-\n19 grants we received.  There is also 8 percent from revenue received.  The revenue includes \nan interlocal agreement. \n \nOne of our divisions is chronic disease prevention and health promotion.  The adolescent \nhealth program conducts abstinence and comprehensive sexual health classes for youth and \nfamilies-talking-together classes that teach parents how they can talk to their children about \nsex.  Staff have been researching creative ways to conduct classes since schools are not \nallowing outsiders in due to COVID-19, although some of the alternative schools for troubled \nyouth have allowed our instructors to teach in person.   \n \nWe also have a Ryan White Retention in Care Program that attempts to find individuals who \nare out of care and have been diagnosed with HIV, determines what their barriers are, and \nhelps get them back into care.  This is mainly focused on the rural and frontier counties.  We \nhave our Tobacco Control and Prevention Program that focuses on providing educational \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 8, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \npresentations to the youth, discouraging initiation of the use of tobacco products and vaping.  \nWe collaborate with the Nevada Tobacco Prevention Coalition and other agencies to educate \ndecision makers and the public on the benefit of policy solutions to address e-cigarette use \namong youth and young adults.  We continue promoting counter-marketing campaigns about \nthe danger of the use of tobacco products and e-cigarettes.  We facilitate referrals from \nproviders that serve the youth to the My Life, My Quit program.  This program is researching \ndifferent ways to reach its audience due to the COVID-19 restrictions.  We also have a small \ngrant for diabetes outreach.  The staffing for the chronic disease prevention and health \npromotion division is 4.5 FTEs and this division is 100 percent grant-funded. \n \nWe also have clinical services, and the services we provide are listed [page 33, Exhibit C].  \nWe receive Title X funding directly from the federal government and we subgrant some of \nthat funding to Douglas County.  We receive other funding from the state either as pass-\nthrough grants or from state funding.  Currently the clinic is seeing patients and we are taking \nmeasures to protect the staff and the clients from COVID-19.  The staffing in that division \nis 10 FTEs and that division is 9 percent general-funded, 61 percent grant funded, and 30 \npercent revenue.  We bill different insurances and we also collect cash payments on a sliding \nscale for services provided to those who are uninsured or who do not wish to use their \ninsurance. \n \nAnother division is disease control and prevention which consists of environmental health \nand epidemiology.  Speaking about the environmental-health side of the division, I have \nlisted the establishments that our health inspectors inspect and permit [pages 35 and 36].  We \nprovide environmental health services to Douglas County through an interlocal agreement.  \nOther duties are also listed here; please note that a couple of the duties are only in Carson \nCity.  Staffing within that program is 6.5 FTEs, and that program is 34 percent general-\nfunded,  2  percent  grant-funded,  55  percent  interlocal-funded,  and  revenue  makes  up \n9 percent.   \n \nThe other side of this division is epidemiology.  Having both environmental health and \nepidemiology under one division created some really big challenges when the pandemic \nstarted, and we will be looking at something changing in the future. \n \nOur epidemiology program is very involved in COVID-19 contact tracing and reporting \n[page 37].  Along with COVID-19, there continue to be other reportable diseases that need to \nbe investigated.  Currently we have 1.5 FTEs working on those other diseases.  Staffing for \nthis entire program currently is 16.5 FTEs.  Prior to COVID-19 it was 2 FTEs.  We also have \nsome individuals helping us who are not included in our staffing.  We have two from the \nNational  Guard,  we  have  two  behavioral  health  ambassadors,  and  we  have  two  CDC \nFoundation  employees  until  March  31.    We  will  be  adding  the  two  CDC  Foundation \nemployees to our staffing.  This epidemiology program is 2 percent general funded and \n98 percent grant funded.    \n \nI have added our organizational chart [page 38].  Carson City Health and Human Services is \ndifferent from other Nevada health authorities by having human services within the health \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 8, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \ndepartment [page 39].  This division provides health, welfare, and community assistance as \nrequired by NRS along with some of the other activities previously listed.  I would like to \ntalk about the Forensics Assessment Services Triage Team.  This is a collaboration with \nother service agencies that go into the county jail and attempt to connect inmates with \nservices so they will have that upon release.  This division has 8 FTEs and is 45 percent \ngeneral-funded and 55 percent grant-funded.  \n \nAs this is a public health emergency, our public health preparedness division is leading a \nCOVID-19 response [page 40, Exhibit C].  Testing and vaccination efforts are being led by \nthis division, along with working with other city, county, and governmental entities.  We do \nhave delegation of authority from the state and counties to provide COVID-19 service to \nDouglas, Lyon, and Storey Counties in addition to Carson City.  Our staffing prior to \nCOVID-19 was 5 FTEs, and we are now up to 20 FTEs for the COVID-19 response.  We \nhave one volunteer registered nurse doing testing, and we have 10 to 14 National Guard \nmembers for two to four days per week.  This division is 100 percent grant-funded, and \nI included the organizational chart for this division [page 41]. \n \nI included the COVID-19 timeline showing our response [page 42].  We have been at this for \na year since we started with planning for the repatriation of our 15 residents from the Grand \nPrincess cruise ship.  As part of our COVID-19 response, we have conducted 92 testing \nevents since May, along with testing at the health department Monday through Friday.  We \nhave conducted 35 vaccination events since the end of December.  The quad counties' \ncumulative positive cases are 10,910, and we have had 7,934 recoveries.  As of February 6, \n2021, we have received 11,975 vaccinations, and we have given 11,258 vaccinations.  We do \nhave 700 second-dose vaccinations that we will be administering this week.  Our partners \ninclude our city and county governments, the state of Nevada, the Division of Public and \nBehavioral  Health,  the  state  of  Nevada's  immunization  program,  the  state's  Division  of \nEmergency Management, Immunize Nevada, the National Guard, area hospitals, and our area \ndoctors.  As you saw earlier, we have utilized a lot of those partners in Ms. Peek's chart in \nthis endeavor.  \n \nI have included pictures on the following slide [page 44].  We did a vaccination clinic at the \nCarson Valley Inn.  It was snowing that day, which led to our decision not to conduct any \nmore  outdoor  events.    The  lower  picture  in  the  middle  is  our  trailer  which  contains \neverything we need, so we are taking the show on the road.   \n \nWe see our challenges as opportunities for improvement.  As was talked about, we have a \nchallenge with public health funding, and we have seen some big challenges with ZIP Codes \nthat cross county lines.  Our public and the diseases do not recognize county lines.  Our \nhealth department is very lean, which was mentioned during our accreditation site visit.  As a \nresult, it was very difficult at the beginning of the pandemic to get the work done.  We were \nworking long hours to get it done, so we opened up a quad county emergency operations \ncenter.  Many of us wear different hats, so keeping up with all our other duties has been \nchallenging.  We are limited on space.  Currently, we are finding sites for testing and \nvaccination.  We are planning a mass vaccination when we get a higher allocation, but \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 8, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nsometimes finding sites for testing and vaccination can be difficult since we are in four \ndifferent counties. \n \nOur IT infrastructure has been pushed to its limits.  Our current scheduling system is a \nchallenge right now, but I am hoping for that to improve.  Working with four counties and \nfour  separate  governmental  boards  and  four  different  health  officers  creates  challenges \nsometimes because not everyone thinks the same way.  In 2003 when Carson City's board of \nsupervisors voted to have a board of health, regionalization was being discussed.  The quad \ncounties concept has been successful for the public health preparedness program, so in the \nfuture an opportunity will be to continue to explore the value of having a quad counties \nhealth department to serve the region with a single board of health. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDoes anyone have any questions?  [There was no response.]  The next person on our list is \nMr. Kevin Dick. \n \nKevin Dick, District Health Officer, Washoe County Health District: \nThe Washoe County Health District was established under NRS Chapter 439 under the \nprovision for counties with populations of less than 700,000 [page 48, Exhibit C].  That \nprovides for cities and the county to come together to establish a health district.  That was \nformally done in 1972 through an interlocal agreement among Reno, Sparks, and Washoe \nCounty.  We have a seven-member district board of health with two members appointed by \neach jurisdiction, one of which is elected, and those six members appoint a physician as the \nseventh member.  Per NRS Chapter 439, we have jurisdiction over all public health matters \nin Washoe County.  \n \nThe  mission  of  public  health  is  to  protect  and  improve  the  health  of  the  community \n[page 49].  It is a population- and community-level approach which makes it quite distinct \nfrom health care which provides medical care to individuals.  As part of this activity, we \nassess the health status of our community, and in that work we identify the factors that drive \nmortality and morbidity in our community.  We find inequities in some populations that are \nshaped by demographics, and social and economic disparities are driving a lot of the poor \nhealth outcomes we see. \n \nI like to compare public health to an intelligence agency.  For the most part, we operate 24/7 \nquietly in the background, we identify public health threats, and then we develop strategies to \neliminate or control them.  If we are successful with that, no one really notices us and what \nwe do.  It is pretty difficult, however, to hide a pandemic, so we have been very visible in the \nnews this past year with COVID-19.  Usually the community is not so aware of our activities. \n \nWe are conducting surveillance.  We get reports of reportable diseases identified by the labs \nunder NRS Chapter 441A.  We also have some real-time surveillance we used to look at \nambulance  response  and  the  types  of  cases  they  are  responding  to,  information  from \nemergency departments, and reports concerning admissions into hospitals.  We have an \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 8, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nintelligence platform that provides us with information about medications sold over the \ncounter at the pharmacies and drug stores in our communities. \n \nWe also use disease prevention to control and prevent disease.  Part of that is the disease \ninvestigation work we do on reportable diseases.  Immunization programs are a component \nof that.  We have established regulations for a number of types of establishments and \noperations that pose public health threats in our community.  We also mitigate against the \nspread of disease.  People have become quite familiar with mitigation from the COVID-19 \nresponse,  the  masking  and  social  distancing  and  the  reductions  in  capacities  for  some \nbusinesses.  Other mitigations are isolation and quarantining of individuals who have been \nexposed to diseases.  We also perform mosquito abatement and issue boil water orders when \na water system has been disrupted. \n \nCommunications are also very important for public health.  They can alert our community to \npublic health threats so the community can respond appropriately, as well as educating the \ncommunity on healthy practices and behaviors. \n \nThis next slide provides an organizational chart for the health district and the allocations of \nFTEs across our different programs [page 50, Exhibit C].  We are organized with four \ndivisions providing public health services to our community as well as the administrative \nhealth services office and the office of the district health officer.  The slide also provides \ninformation on the membership of the district board of health.  We have about 166 FTEs \nnormally  operating  at  the  health  district.    That  has  been  expanded  significantly  by  the \nCOVID-19 response. \n \nI  am  going  to  run  through  the  different  divisions  that  provide  services  [page  51].    In \ncommunity and clinical health, the community health component is really the chronic disease \nprevention program.  In Washoe County, we focus on tobacco and substance misuse as well \nas overweight and obesity as some of the driving factors for the chronic disease burden we \nsee.  Our clinical services are all designed with a public health intention of improving \ncommunity health and reducing the transmission of disease in the community.  We are not a \nmedical care clinic; we have two Federally Qualified Health Centers, Northern Nevada \nHOPES and Community Health Alliance, that provide excellent medical/clinical services for \nour community.  Our services are oriented around family planning.  We provide reproductive \nhealth services and immunizations that focus mostly on childhood immunizations.  We have \na  small  maternal,  child,  and  adolescent  health  program  and  a  WIC  program  [Special \nSupplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children] that provides nutritional \nsupport for infants and mothers as well as education and counseling regarding nutrition and \nbreastfeeding. \n \nOur sexual health program works to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases \nas well as provides testing to identify and treat those diseases.  Our HIV program is involved \nin  testing  for  HIV  and  connecting  people  who  are  found  to  be  HIV  positive  with  the \nappropriate medical care.  Our tuberculosis (TB) program also does testing and provides \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 8, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \ntreatment for TB as well as disease investigation of those who might have been exposed to \npeople infected with TB in our community. \n \nOur epidemiology and public health preparedness division houses our epidemiology program \nwhich is responsible for the surveillance and disease investigation functions.  Our public \nhealth  preparedness  program  develops  plans  for  pandemic  response,  bioterrorism,  and \nradiological attacks, and exercises those plans with community partners.  Also, everyone at \nthe Washoe County Health District is trained under the federal incident command system so \nwe are ready to stand up and function either independently or as partners in an emergency \nresponse. \n \nWe have vital statistics, so we are responsible for recording births and deaths in Washoe \nCounty as well as issuing birth and death certificates.  Also, Washoe County is unique in that \nthe health district has oversight of our regional ambulance franchise for services through \nRegional Emergency Medical Services Authority (REMSA).  In addition, we also have an \nemergency medical service (EMS) program that is focused on oversight and coordination \namong the EMS partners, our fire agencies, dispatch, and REMSA to keep the EMS system \nfunctioning efficiently. \n \nThis is an organizational chart of the different programs we have in environmental health \nservices [page 53, Exhibit C].  These are organized to prevent public health threats posed by \ndifferent  establishments  and  different  operations  in  Washoe  County.    You  can  see  the \ndifferent types of establishments we regulate.  I would like to help out with a few of the \nacronyms on this page.  Under food safety are the \"HACCP/Operational Plans\" which are the \nhazard analysis critical control points.  These are plans around critical points within a food \nservice establishment for addressing risks.  We are trying to take a very risk-based approach \nwith our regulatory oversight for these different entities.  Under special events you will see \n\"EPI/FBD Complaints.\"  We respond to epidemiology and food-borne disease complaints in \nthat program area.  Under our commercial plans and permitted facilities you will see \"IBD.\"  \nWe regulate invasive body decorations which are body piercing and tattoo parlors.  We also \nregulate what are listed as \"RV/MHP;\" those are recreational vehicle and mobile home parks.  \nUnder our waste management functions, you will see \"UST,\" which are underground storage \ntanks; we provide permitting for the construction of those. \n \nWe are unique in Nevada in that we provide air quality management programs [page 54].  \nUnder state statute, the health district is designated to implement the federal Clean Air Act in \nWashoe County.  We have a network of monitoring stations and we put out daily air quality \ninformation and alerts as necessary.  We have a planning area where we work to try to \nprevent deterioration of our air quality in Washoe County, so we have a woodstove program \nthat addresses use of certified clean-burning stoves and the issuing of burn codes when we \nhave inversions.  We also have a smog check program and programs to address ozone \nprecursors coming from vehicles.  Our permitting program addresses stationary air pollution \nsources, surface disturbances for dust control, and demolition and remodeling activities in \nregard to asbestos abatement.  We do inspections and enforcement if we find problems with \nthose permitted facilities. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 8, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nThe office of the district health officer falls under me directly, and we work to support the \nboard of health and its monthly board meetings [page 55].  We also are an accredited health \ndistrict.    We  received  our  national  accreditation  in  2019,  and  we  work  with  the  other \ndivisions  across  the  health  district  to  maintain  that  accreditation  status.    We  do  health \nassessments, and through those we work with our partners to identify how to work together \nas a community to improve the priority areas we identified in the assessments.  Currently we \nare focusing on areas of housing and homelessness, behavioral health, and physical activity \nand nutrition with a number of community partners, with a plan for moving forward which \nwe have been implementing over the past few years. \n \nWe  lead  our  quality  improvement  and  workforce  development  efforts  as  well  as  our \ncommunications.  I want to also acknowledge our government affairs liaison, Joelle Dodson.  \nYou may see her presenting testimony, public comment, or communicating with you during \nthe session.  \n \nThis is our $24 million budget for 2021 without the additional funding we have received for \nCOVID-19 [page 56, Exhibit C].  Our largest funding comes from the general fund transfer \nfrom Washoe County and is about 40 percent of our budget.  Under statute, we are also able \nto charge fees for services such as permitting and other regulatory oversight activities.  We \ncollect revenue from the sale of tires in Nevada that supports some of our solid waste \nmanagement efforts.  Our air quality program is supported through a $1 fee on the smog \ncertificates issued in Washoe County.   \n \nThe federal and state grants that compose just over 25 percent of our budget are mostly \nfederal funding that is either direct or passed through the state.  As was mentioned, Nevada \nhas a very low state investment in public health, and so we receive 1.8 percent of our budget \nfrom state funding through grants.  We have received an additional $16.8 million in federal \nfunds for the COVID-19 response in addition to our $24 million budget, so you can see that \nis a significant additional source of funding.   \n \nHere  is  a  quick  overview  of  our  COVID-19  response  [page  57].    We  activated  our \ndepartment's incident command system on January 17, 2020.  Our first case occurred on \nMarch 5, and then we moved to a regional response.  We have been at it ever since.  These \npictures are of our response.  We have learned and improvised as we learned more about the \ndisease.  You will see here some historic photos that span our premask days and our mask \ndays and response. \n \nSince the pandemic started, we stood up a drive-through COVID-19 testing operation that we \nhad operational within one-and-a-half days of having our first case identified in Washoe \nCounty on March 5.  We have learned from and improved that operation since that day and \nhave expanded it dramatically.  We are now using that same facility for our COVID-19 \nvaccination point of dispensing (POD).  We set a new record last Friday with 1,800 people \nvaccinated.  We stood up a COVID-19 call center, and we now have 24 people dedicated to \nstaffing that.  The call center does the scheduling for testing as well as for administering the \nvaccines.  It provides for reporting of test results and does an incredible amount of data entry \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 8, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nwork on the backside of providing those vaccines, to get that information into the data \nmanagement systems the federal government has set up. \n \nWe have increased the number of disease investigators from 3 to over 50—to contact the \npositive cases and have them isolate and to identify close contacts for quarantine.  We have \nover 85 people working in our field operation for testing and vaccinations. \n \nMuch like Ms. Aaker was talking about in Carson City, space has been a requirement as we \nhave expanded staffing.  When I send an email to all health district staff, it now goes to a list \nof 366 people.  We have taken over buildings C and D of the county complex in addition to \nbuilding  B that  we  normally  occupy.    We  have  benefitted  from  many  people who  are \nremotely working because we have been able to take up some of the space they used to \noccupy.   Scott Oxarart, our communications manager, has done a phenomenal job.  We put \nout over 330 press releases over the last year, and I held over 60 media briefings over the \ncourse of the year.  Mr. Oxarart has led our regional information center which created two \nwebsites, one on the COVID-19 response and the other specifically on the vaccine, now that \nit is available, and how we are managing that.  There are also several social media platforms \nand accounts that have been established.  We could not have done all this without the \npartners we have.  The National Guard is integrated into our operation.  We have the \ncommunity emergency response team and medical reserve corps volunteers all helping with \nour operations. \n \nCOVID-19 has laid bare the social inequities in our community for health outcomes.  Many \npeople are living on the edge.  They have to work to provide food for their families and a \nroof over their heads.  These are essential workers.  Many work jobs that earn below \nminimum wage.  They are not able to work remotely; they do not have paid sick leave; and \nthey often live in close quarters with other family members.  As a result, we have seen a \ndisproportionate impact within our Hispanic community throughout this pandemic.  We also \nneed to understand that the data on testing show that the Hispanic population is being tested \nin disproportionately low numbers relative to their population in Nevada, so these numbers \nmay not be reliable [page 59, Exhibit C].  We have also seen a devastating impact on our \nelderly population with the number of deaths occurring in that segment of our population. \n \nFortunately, we are trending better with the number of cases we are experiencing in our \ncommunity.  While this figure is from last week, as of yesterday, our seven-day moving \naverage for new cases in Washoe County is down to 90 and our positivity rate has declined to \n11.1 percent [page 60].  Not so long ago, the positivity rate was 22 percent, so we are grateful \nto see this.  We are not out of the woods yet; we want to continue to see these numbers \ndecrease, but we think we are seeing good outcomes with everyone working together, the \nmitigation measures, and the pause the Governor instituted.  Sadly, 616 deaths have been \nreported in Washoe County to date.  When we were surging here in Washoe County, it was \nvery frightening.  Our health system was under great stress, and we were seriously looking at \nthe possibility that we would need to ration medical care, so I am very relieved to see these \nnumbers going down as they are. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 8, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nThis is a picture on December 15 of our first shipment of Pfizer vaccine arriving at the health \ndistrict [page 61].  Fortunately, we were able to obtain an ultracold freezer, so we were able \nto receive and store the Pfizer vaccine as well as the Moderna vaccine here at the health \ndistrict.  We also have a number of PODs providing the vaccine in the community as shown \nhere [page 62].  We have a retail pharmacy vaccine program in which we have pharmacies \nthat are vaccinating staff and residents of long-term care facilities.  We also have community \npartners and POD strike teams doing vaccinations; our fire agencies have been engaged in \nproviding PODs, and the Community Health Alliance also is providing vaccines in a POD at \nits parking lot. \n \nThe rest of my presentation consists of a few pictures [pages 62-66, Exhibit C].   There is an \naerial view of six lanes at the Reno-Sparks Livestock Events Center, of the vehicles stacked \nup in those lanes, and the testing stations we use.  We also have a view of stations with \nmodular  roofing  we  put  together  and  of  the  inside  where  the  vaccine  is  dispensed  by \npharmacists and we collect the paperwork.  The next slide shows our vaccine distribution \nstatistics [page 67].  As of today, we have administered over 29,000 vaccine doses through \nthe  health  district.    The  next  slide  provides  you  with  the  website  for  our  vaccination \ninformation  which  people  could  use  to  find  out  how  soon  they  might  get  vaccinated \n[page 68].  We are maintaining a waiting list for seniors, and we also have a phone number \navailable which is 775-328-2427. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there questions? \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nThank you for your presentation and all your hard work.  I know Washoe County has had a \nparticularly difficult time because our homeless population has been increasing and now the \nwinter months have hit.  I would like to hear a little about treating and testing our homeless \npopulation, managing care for them, housing them in facilities that are accommodating their \nneeds, and how you are balancing that. \n \nKevin Dick: \nWe are working closely with the human services agency and our other regional partners \nregarding the homeless population.  Some of the first pictures you saw relating to COVID-19 \nwere photos of testing we were doing at the Reno Events Center.  We utilized that facility so \nwe could provide additional distancing for the shelter population because there was limited \nspace at the Record Street community assistance center.  The county also has been able to \nstand up new facilities for women and families at the Northern Nevada Adult Mental Health \nServices campus so that is providing additional capacity there.  A men's shelter has been \nestablished on Fourth Street to increase the population that can be housed there.  A positive \nresult of this has been the work done together across the region on plans for a larger area for \nthe homeless—a campus and complex, an area called the Governor's Bowl.  For people who \nare homeless and who have tested positive for COVID-19, we have a contract regionally with \nWellCare.  They are able to accept those people who do not require hospital-level care and \nprovide them with support services and housing during their isolation period. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 8, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nIf you have data on the virus contraction rates in our homeless population, as well as the \ndemographics, it would be really good to see that information.  Can you follow up with staff \non that? \n \nKevin Dick: \nI can follow up on that. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any other questions?  [There was no response.]  I will now move to our last \npresentation of the day, the Southern Nevada Health District. \n \nFermin Leguen, District Health Officer, Southern Nevada Health District: \nIn southern Nevada, we have our board of health and there are 11 members of the board with \nrepresentation from different cities and the county [page 70, Exhibit C].  We now have more \nthan 680 employees, which is significant growth from our previous numbers.  About two \nyears ago, there were fewer than 500 employees here.   \n \nThere are five divisions in our health district, among them community health, environmental \nhealth, critical services, administration, and a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC), \nwhich is a new development within the health district.  We received an award from the \nHealth  Resources  and  Services  Administration  (HRSA)  within  the  U.S.  Department  of \nHealth  and  Human  Services  in  September  2019,  and  we  were  able  to  start  the  FQHC \noperations.  Recently we received a second award from HRSA that allowed our operation for \nthe next three years.  Right now, we are still developing our health center, but it is fully \nfunctional. \n \nWe have a similar administration as the ones presented by our colleagues, so I will not \npresent an organizational chart or how the divisions operate.  Those are very common among \nthe health districts.  I just want to emphasize some of the areas where we have a different \napproach.  For example, two years ago we started offering a preventive medicine program.  \nThat  is  something  that  was  created  because  there  is  a  need  for  preventive  medicine \nphysicians in Nevada, and we saw the opportunity to really contribute to that effort.  That is a \npartnership between us and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV).  The residents \nspend the first year doing their master of public health programs at the university and then, \nthe second year, they do their clinical and management rotations here with us at the health \ndistrict.  We also have been working on other projects regarding opioid reduction.  We \nreceived a grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for overdose \ndata  collection  with  the  engagement  of  surveillance  and  preventive  action  for  a  drug \noverdose.   \n \nThis was our budget at the beginning of the fiscal year beginning on July 1 [page 72].  It was \n$98 million.  Our current budget is $139 million.  Because of COVID-19, we received almost \n$32-$33  million  from  the  CDC  to  support  our  enhanced  surveillance  activities,  contact \ntracing, and testing.  The federal grant represents about 22 percent of our budget, so it is a \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 8, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nlittle bit different from what the slide shows because there was almost a 30 percent increase \nin our budget because of COVID-19 activities.  We do have concerns about our budget for \nthis coming fiscal year because our budget normally receives between 25 and 28 percent \nfrom local property taxes, and our expectation is that those taxes might decrease next year.  \nThat would have a negative impact in our activities, so this is something we have been \ntalking with the county about, and we also are trying to prepare for that for next year. \n \nThis is a picture of our dashboard and it is available online [page 73].  This is the site where \nwe share information with our community and anyone in the country who has an interest in \nour data.  We have here the current number of cases that have been reported in Clark County, \nhospitalizations, and also the number of deaths.  In the main menu of the dashboard there are \nseven areas where people can click and get additional information.  We have data by ZIP \nCode and mapping.  Also, under the \"Characteristics\" tab, people can look at trends.  The last \nthing we incorporated into our dashboard was the place of possible exposure.  There we share \nwith the community the areas that our cases report as being visited within the previous \n14 days.  That is something we utilize with our environmental health division.  We have that \ninformation in conjunction with additional data we receive from our patients.  Then, of \ncourse, there is the trend of the pandemic in Clark County from last year until now.  For the \nlast few weeks, we have seen a very big decrease in the number of cases.  We hope it \ncontinues that way. \n \nThis is the incidence of COVID-19 in Clark County by race/ethnicity [page 74, Exhibit C].  \nSince the beginning of this pandemic, in Clark County we have seen that the Hispanic \npopulation has been the one with the largest impact in terms of cases.  This has been very \nconsistent throughout the pandemic.  With the Hispanic population in Clark County, this high \nincidence they are experiencing actually does not appear to translate to mortality.  The \nreported mortality for Hispanics in Clark County is the lowest among the different racial and \nethnic groups. \n \nThis is our ZIP Code map, and this is something we use in addition to the community one for \nthe whole pandemic [page 75].  For this one, we use more recent data—the last 14 days—so \nthat helps identify new areas that could be affected by the pandemic.  What you see here is \nthat most of our high-incidence areas are in the central part of the county.  Those areas \nbelong more to the City of Las Vegas and the City of North Las Vegas.  What you see to the \nright is the east area of Las Vegas:  ZIP Codes 89110, 89142, and the others.  Those are the \nareas where we consistently have seen the largest impact of the pandemic.  These areas also \nare highly populated by members of the Hispanic community as well. \n \nThis is the first day the vaccine arrived in Clark County [page 76].  It was December 14, and \nwe distributed the vaccine immediately, as soon as we received it.  Actually, that very first \nday, we had a POD at one of our local hospitals and then we continued distributing the \nvaccine through the valley during that week. \n \nI also want to mention that for the vaccination campaign we have developed a very strong \npartnership with the county and local jurisdictions and also with local universities:  Touro \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 8, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nUniversity Nevada, UNLV, Roseman University of Health Sciences, the College of Southern \nNevada, and other institutions.  All of them are participating in the pandemic whether it is \nsupporting PODs or providing staff to participate in our operations.  We also have met with \nrepresentatives of churches in the valley, the business community, and representatives of the \nHispanic and African American communities as well.  We also have communications and \npresentations with the Asian community through the Filipino nursing association and their \npartners. \n \nAt  this  point  in  Clark  County,  we  have  administered  more  than  200,000  doses—until \nyesterday, it was 214,000 doses.  Those were distributed all over the county.  We have big \nvaccination sites at Cashman Center, and we offer vaccinations at Western High School, at \nJerome Mack Middle School on the east side of the city, and at Eldorado High School.   \nRecently we opened the Las Vegas Convention Center to offer second-dose vaccinations.   \n \nI also wanted to share with you some data regarding the vaccine here.  Fifty-eight percent of \nthe people who received the vaccine are females.  That might be because of the weight of \nhealth care workers in this population.  Health care workers at this point represent more than \n40 percent of the individuals who have been vaccinated in Clark County. \n \nAlso, in terms of race and ethnicity, 41 percent are white, 10 percent Asian, 10 percent \nHispanic, 6 percent African American, and about 30 percent of the individuals are either \n\"other\" or \"unknown,\" complicating the issue of race/ethnicity analysis, but it is important to \nknow that.  In terms of who administered the vaccine, 64,000 doses have been administered \nby  hospitals,  representing  more  than  30  percent  of  both  doses;  58  percent  has  been \nadministered by the health district at Cashman Center.   \n \nThis  is  a  ZIP  Code  map  showing  the  distribution  of  doses  in  Clark  County  [page  79, \nExhibit C].  What we want to highlight here is that until last week, the numbers in Clark \nCounty of vaccine distributed did not match what was happening with the incidence of \nCOVID-19 in Clark County [page 80].  To the left is the incidence-by-ZIP-Code map.  To \nthe right is the vaccine-administered map.  The vaccine-administered map does not match \ngeographically the incidence-by-ZIP-Code map.   \n \nAs  you  probably  are  aware,  there  were  recent  comments  or  declarations  about  health \ninequality in Clark County and the way that we distribute the vaccine.  I believe those were \nunfair because until now, more than 40 percent of the vaccines have been distributed to \nhealth care workers.  Also, we have issues with the race/ethnicity analysis in terms of the \nweight of the unknown and other groups.   \n \nHaving said that, we do have a plan on how to address the health inequalities in Clark \nCounty.  In addition to the large vaccination sites that we have and are planning for in the \nfuture, we will be targeting some communities with smaller teams and PODs in collaboration \nwith elected officials and representatives of community-based organizations and churches in \nthose areas.  When we offer the vaccine at those sites, most of the population who receive the \nvaccine will be the ones who actually live in the area.   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 8, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nThis issue is important to mention.  I was reading an article in The New York Times recently \nthat mentioned health inequalities in this country.  An example was given of some large \nmetropolitan areas deploying large vaccination sites mostly in affluent areas because it was \neasier to do that.  This is not the case in Clark County.  Our PODs are all within the areas \nwhere we have more cases; Cashman Center is just in the middle of all that action, as are all \nthose schools where we have opened PODs.  Those large vaccination PODs do not allow for \nthat kind of control, and that is why we emphasize a small operation when it comes to health \ninequality.  The thing is that the vaccination is open to everybody, and we want everybody to \nreceive it. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo you have any kind of breakdown by Assembly districts of COVID-19 positivity and \nvaccination rates that you might be able to provide the Committee with, even if it is only by \nZIP Code?  That question is also for our previous presenters if they are still on the line. \n \nFermin Leguen: \nYes, I will ask our data people because that most likely will require census tracts; ZIP Codes \nare very unlikely to match the area. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you for your presentation.  A lot of times people did not know exactly what the health \ndistricts did or what they are responsible for.  Now we have a pandemic that they are \nresponsible for, and we appreciate all the challenges and the unique and creative responses \nyour agencies are trying to accommodate and thrive in this situation.        \n \nWith that, I will close the presentation.  Do we have anyone for public comment?  [There \nwas no one.]   \n \nWednesday's agenda includes an overview of mental health in Nevada.  In addition, we will \nhear from the Division of Public and Behavioral Health within the Department of Health and \nHuman Services.  These are important topics for us to know about as a Committee going \nforward with some of the bills we will be seeing.  We will also have presentations from the \nregional behavioral health policy boards.  I will ask everyone to come prepared for the two \nbills we will be hearing.  The first is Assembly Bill 62.  If you want to obtain more \ninformation about the Nevada ABLE Savings Program which was addressed last session, \nI will  have  links  sent  to  you.    Our  first  bill  draft,  Assembly  Joint  Resolution  1  from \nAssemblywoman Titus, will also be presented.  Again, reach out to our policy analyst or our \nlegal counsel if you have any questions while reviewing those bills.      \n  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 8, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nAre there any comments or questions from Committee members?

Today, we have presentations on mental health in \nNevada and hearings on two bills. \n \nBefore we begin, I would like to make several housekeeping announcements.  Agenda items \nmay be taken in a different order than listed.  Two or more agenda items may be combined \nfor consideration, an item may be removed from the agenda, or discussion of an item may be \ndelayed at any time.   \n \nThis virtual meeting format via Zoom is important to keep everyone safe during the COVID-\n19 pandemic.  Members of the public may provide testimony in several different ways, all of \nwhich are listed on the agenda.  Right now, you can register to participate online through the \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 10, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nLegislature's website on the Nevada Electronic Legislative Information System (NELIS) or \nby sending your comments directly to our staff.  \n \nAny committee exhibits may be submitted electronically.  Our members can see them online, \nas well as the public, and we try our best to keep those up to date so you can have access to \nthem before our meetings.  If you are not able to submit public comment over the telephone, \nat the end of the meeting, or during the bill presentations today, you will be able to do so in \nwriting up to 48 hours after our meeting adjournment. \n \nWe will now begin our first agenda item.  There will be an opportunity for limited comments \nor questions from Committee members, but our policy analyst will send out our presenters' \ncontact information; so if you are not able to ask your questions today under these limited \ncircumstances, I encourage you to reach out to them.  They have been very forthcoming with \ninformation when I have needed it, as I am sure they will be with you.  Now I would like to \nstart off with our first presentation from the Department of Health and Human Services. \n \nStephanie  Woodard,  Senior  Advisor  on  Behavioral  Health,  Division  of  Public  and \nBehavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services: \nWe are here today to provide a brief overview of the State of Nevada's behavioral health \nsystem  and  to  discuss  the  impacts  of  COVID-19  on  behavioral  health  in  Nevada  and \nopportunities for behavioral health going forward [Exhibit C].  This presentation is intended \nto be very high-level as an introduction to the state system; we recognize from the outset that \nthe behavioral health system is vast and incredibly complex.  We are not going to be able to \ngo into much detail here; however, both Dr. Megan Freeman and I are available for questions \nfollowing this presentation as well as offline if there are any specific issues or topics you \nwould like to learn more about. \n \nThere are lots of different departments and divisions within the State of Nevada that have \ntouchpoints to behavioral health and play critical roles in ensuring that services and supports \nare provided within other systems such as criminal justice [page 2].  But the Division of \nPublic and Behavioral Health (DPBH), the Division of Child and Family Services (DCFS), \nand  the  Division  of  Health  Care  Financing  and  Policy  all  function  together  under  the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to provide essential elements for the \nstatewide, community-based, behavioral health system.  Behavioral health in Nevada has \nevolved over the past decade, especially with implementation of the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act.  These state-driven systems have helped to expand access to care when \npreviously  the  state  itself  was  the  largest  behavioral  health  provider  in  Nevada.    This \nevolution has required a concerted effort and coordination across divisions within DHHS, \nand DPBH serves as the state mental health authority and the single state authority for \nsubstance abuse treatment and prevention. \n \nCollectively, the three divisions work together to plan, regulate, and provide oversight, \ntraining and technical assistance, and financing to this complex system.  In order for us to do \nthe planning and oversight we provide to the state behavioral health system, we have several \nboards and commissions that help guide our work [page 3].  These include the State Board of \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 10, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nHealth, the regional behavioral health policy boards, the Behavioral Health Planning and \nAdvisory Council, and the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Agency Advisory \nBoard.  Collectively, these have, in one way or another, an opportunity to provide planning, \noversight, regulation, and advocacy for behavioral health in Nevada. \n \nThe DPBH has several priorities moving into this biennium, and they include things like \nevidence-based forensic services, improved behavioral health through promotion, prevention, \nearly  intervention,  and  access  to  quality  behavioral  health  services,  and  continuing  to \nimprove inter- and intra-agency communication and collaboration [page 4, Exhibit C]. \n \nThis  is  a  brief  summary  of  what  the  behavioral  health  system  looks  like  in  Nevada, \nspecifically as it relates to DPBH.  As the state mental health authority, we have direct \nservices in both civil and forensic.  We also provide a high level of policy advisement, and \nwe manage a number of federal and state grants that are often passed through to community \nprograms to assist in prevention programming as well as to support community behavioral \nhealth  providers  to  establish  new  programs.    We  work  with  those  programs  toward \nsustainability, and we use some of the funding to help provide services for individuals who \nare uninsured or underinsured [pages 5-7].  The behavioral health system also includes the \nBureau of Health Care Quality and Compliance.  They often assist with the licensure of \nhealth  care  facilities  including  some  of  the  foundational  facilities  that  are  part  of  the \nbehavioral  health  system  in  Nevada.    Then  we  have  administrative  services  which  are \nabsolutely essential for us to be able to administer the grant funds we receive. \n \nFor our clinical services on the civil side we have two inpatient psychiatric hospitals, one \neach in Washoe and Clark Counties [pages 8 and 9].  The access to inpatient services usually \nis for an individual who is admitted under an emergency through a mental health crisis; \nhowever, they do also have voluntary admissions.  There are also several outpatient clinics \nthat make up a network of care within our state.  There are four of these clinics in urban \nareas—three in Clark County and one in Washoe County—as well as eighteen community-\nbased clinics throughout rural Nevada. \n \nAccess to outpatient services is completely voluntary unless the individual has been ordered \nto mental health court or to assisted outpatient treatment.  It is important to note that our civil \nservice  outpatient  programs  really  do  provide  the  safety  net  services  for  individuals  in \nNevada who are uninsured or underinsured.  They also work very closely in collaboration \nwith community partners to provide a no-wrong-door approach on the campuses of both the \nNorthern  Nevada  Adult  Mental  Health  Services—Dini-Townsend  Hospital—and  the \nSouthern Nevada Adult Mental Health Services.  But they also provide coordination of care \nwith many community-based programs.  In addition to the community-based programs they \nwork in, they also provide an array of services related to outpatient mental health services. \n \nOn the forensic side, we have two hospitals in Nevada—Lakes Crossing Center in Sparks \nand  the  Stein  Hospital  forensic  facility  in  southern  Nevada  [pages  10-12].    These  two \nhospitals care for individuals who are working toward restoration of competency.  They have \nlong-term inpatient forensic programs for individuals who are committed to the division, and \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 10, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nthey are serving individuals who were acquitted as not guilty by reason of insanity.  These \nforensic hospitals have been working very hard over the last several years to assist in \naddressing  the  federal  consent  decree  around  the  inability  of  the  state's  single  forensic \nhospital to admit all court-ordered referrals in a timely manner.  They have recently been able \nto move out of the consent decree, but it is important to acknowledge that the forensic \nhospitals remain at or near full capacity.  Although the consent decree has expired without \npenalties or further oversight, the state is continuously focused on careful management in \norder to meet demand and avoid any other legal challenges. \n \nThose are the two areas where there are direct clinical services that are provided within the \nDivision of Public and Behavioral Health on both the civil and forensic side, but as we have \nworked to move away from being the largest behavioral health provider in Nevada and to \nbuild capacity at the community level, we have recognized the need for additional support to \nhelp build that community capacity.  The behavioral health policy unit works to administer \nthe  majority  of  our  large  federal  funding  streams  that  are  used  to  address  specific \npopulations, including those who are uninsured and underinsured [page 13, Exhibit C].  This \nalso requires the policy division to work on additional supports such as technical assistance, \nstrategic planning, and implementation of systems within the state and in communities. \n \nSome of the behavioral health policy areas of focus include addressing minority health \ninequity and disparities and supporting evidence-based practices.  After COVID-19, we did a \nlot to help support community agencies to fully implement telehealth and to focus on suicide \nprevention and crisis services. \n \nThat is my very brief overview of the behavioral health system as it relates to the Division of \nPublic and Behavioral Health, and now I will hand this presentation over to Dr. Megan \nFreeman at the Division of Child and Family Services to provide a similar overview of their \nsystem.   \n \nMegan Freeman, Clinical and Policy Advisor on Children's Behavioral Health, Division \nof Child and Family Services, Department of Health and Human Services: \nThank you for the opportunity to present to you on children's mental health [Exhibit D].  \nToday I would like to give you an overview of our agency operations and explain how our \nwork shapes the children's mental health system in Nevada.  On this slide [page 3], you will \nsee our agency vision and mission.  In trying to improve conditions for youth in every \nNevada community, we seek to break down barriers to access to care in every region across \nthe state, to eliminate disproportionality in our systems, and to meet the needs of special \npopulations.   \n \nIn  addition  to  our  agency  vision  and  mission,  three  regional  children's  mental  health \nconsortia guide the growth and development of our children's mental health system.  The \nmakeup and roles of the children's mental health consortia are defined in Nevada Revised \nStatutes, and the consortia chairs and I will speak to this Committee on February 15 in more \ndetail about this [page 4]. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 10, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nNext, I would like to touch on another important value system that guides our work.  Nearly \n30 years ago, a federal initiative known as the Children's Mental Health Initiative was \nauthorized to facilitate the delivery of comprehensive community mental health services to \nchildren and youth.  Through this initiative, hundreds of demonstration grants, cooperative \nagreements,  and  expansion  grants  have  been  funded  throughout  the  United  States  to \nencourage the widespread adoption of what is called the \"system of care\" approach.  The \nDivision of Child and Family Services (DCFS) has received three grants under the Children's \nMental Health Initiative and is committed to the system of care (SOC) approach.  The core \nvalues of an SOC approach include providing services and creating systems that are family-\ndriven and youth-guided.  The services are community-based, accessible, and provided in the \nleast  restrictive  environment,  and  services  and  systems  are  culturally  and  linguistically \nappropriate [page 5, Exhibit D].  The Division of Child and Family Services' operations are \ndivided into four separate areas, which you can see here [page 6].  In 2019, DCFS underwent \nan internal reorganization to move away from our traditional orientation around children's \nmental health, child welfare, and juvenile justice services.  This resulted in new coordination \nof our services around community-based services, residential or 24-hour services, and quality \nand  oversight.    Since  the  reorganization,  we  have  been  working  to  break  down  silos, \nincorporate children's mental health programming throughout the child and family services \nsystem, and incorporate continuous quality improvement into all programs at all levels to \nbetter serve youth—many of whom touch multiple of our systems. \n \nIn our community services area are located all our outpatient, mobile, and other community-\nbased services including child protective and welfare services for rural Nevada.  We offer \nservices for ages 0 to 17, or into the early 20s if the youth is still enrolled in K-12 school.  \nWe primarily serve Medicaid fee-for-service, uninsured, underinsured, and undocumented \nfamilies.  For some programs such as our mobile crisis response team, we serve any family in \nneed at no cost.   \n \nThe focus of our residential services programs is 24-hour care.  This includes acute care, \nresidential treatment, and juvenile justice youth facilities.  Our youth facilities are focused on \nprogramming and not on punishment.  Per policy, every youth receives an assessment for \nmental health and substance-use treatment needs, and treatment is provided as needed.  Our \nyouth facilities also operate under a recently modernized suicide prevention policy.   \n \nOur quality and oversight area is focused on policy, quality assurance, and DCFS in its \noversight/regulatory role as a state agency.  Additionally, our systems advocate is located in \nthe quality and oversight area.  This position functions as our public information officer and \nlegislative liaison.   \n \nDivision of Child and Family Services administrative services are focused on support and \ninfrastructure with the additional recent expansion of our victims services area.  Nevada's \nVictims of Crime Program is located here and provides financial support to individuals who \nhave been the victims of violent crimes.  Additionally, victims services holds Nevada's \nAntiterrorism and Emergency Assistance Program, a $16 million multiyear award to support \nvictims  of  the  Route  91  Harvest  Festival  shooting  on  October  1,  2017,  in  Las  Vegas.  \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 10, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nBehavioral health support is a main focus of recovery for Route 91 survivors.  Finally, \nthrough our victims of crime funding, we are providing funding for innovative programming \nthat  addresses  the  needs  of  children  exposed  to  domestic  violence  and  for  victims  of \ncommercial sexual exploitation, including children. \n \nIn  2020,  our  psychiatric  residential  treatment  facilities  achieved  accreditation  by  the \nCommission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF).  This was a multiyear, \nhighly intensive process that has resulted in more in-state beds for youth with higher levels of \nneed.  In the coming biennium, residential services will be focused on implementing the \nBuilding  Bridges  program—a  set  of  best  practices  for  transforming  systems  to  create \npartnerships and collaboration between families, youth, advocates, service providers, and \noversight agencies.  A primary goal of the Building Bridges program is to sustain positive \noutcomes after a discharge from residential placement. \n \nOn the next slide [page 8, Exhibit D] you will see our two active sources of competitive \nfederal funding including our pediatric mental health care access grant which works to \nintegrate pediatric psychiatry and behavioral health consultation services into rural primary \ncare.  Our system of care expansion grant has multiple goals, but the overarching objective is \nsystem  improvement  which  will  expand  the  service  array  in  rural  Nevada  and  provide \ninfrastructure to grow DCFS's capacity to serve in an oversight role for children's behavioral \nhealth.  In particular, this system of care grant will expand access to wraparound services, \nrespite  care,  and  family  care  support.    We  have  also  been  focused  on  supporting  the \nimplementation of a 1915(i) Medicaid state plan amendment to expand the service array for \nyouth in specialized foster care, also known as treatment foster care for youth with intensive \nbehavioral health needs.   \n \nIn our community services area, it is important to highlight the work of our mobile crisis \nresponse teams as a primary method or point of entry for families to access services and \nbecome matched to the correct services and supports for their needs [page 9].  Using some \nemergency  COVID-19  funding,  we  were  able  to  temporarily  expand  the  mobile  crisis \nprogram to meet increased need and create additional teams, as well as expand our ability to \nprovide telehealth services 24/7 statewide when previously, statewide 24/7 response was only \navailable in Las Vegas.  However, the funding is temporary. \n \nFinally,  within  community  services,  tiered  care  coordination  is  available  to  youth  with \nmultiple system needs, in order to build the family's capacity to meet their youth's needs as \nwell as match them to formal services and supports.  Tiered-care coordination includes High \nFidelity Wraparound and a program called FOCUS for youth with intermediate-level needs. \n \nA lot of what we do is focused on direct services, but our quality and oversight area is where \nwe focus more on policy and our regulatory role.  In our quality and oversight area we are \ncurrently recruiting for a position that would be embedded in Nevada Medicaid to support \npolicy  development  and  on-the-ground  technical  assistance  for  schools  implementing \nMedicaid billing.  The position will have a particular focus on the Clark County School \nDistrict as the largest district in the state. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 10, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nLooking to the future, there are significant workforce needs in quality and oversight.  The \nDivision of Child and Family Services would like to move forward with becoming the \nchildren's mental health authority in Nevada, which would allow us to set provider standards, \nrun a technical assistance and training center for evidence-based practices, and provide \noversight and quality assurance to ensure that providers using public funding for mental and \nbehavioral health care for children are adhering to standards in quality criteria.  We currently \nlack the staffing necessary to stand up the technical assistance and training center or to scale \nup  oversight  and  quality  assurance.    By  creating  an  infrastructure  for  widespread \ndissemination and oversight of evidence-based practices, particularly home and community-\nbased services, we can follow the footsteps of other communities that have returned youth \nfrom out-of-state placements, closed residential treatment centers and juvenile justice centers, \nand achieved the system of care expansion goal of curating an array of effective, evidence-\nbased, community-based treatment options.  Our previous system of care grant identified the \nneed for a children's mental health authority, and we were planning to begin those efforts \nduring this legislative session.  Given the current budget constraints, we are looking at \nalternate ways to begin this work.  Our current system of care grant provides the theoretical \nframework in initial funding to build the beginning infrastructure for the children's mental \nhealth authority.  However, we need a sustainable plan to position DCFS as the entity \nin Nevada  that  ensures  children,  youth,  and  families  receive  the  best  possible  mental \nand behavioral health care so they can achieve their goals.  I will now turn this over to \nDr. Woodard to continue the presentation on behavioral health needs in Nevada.  \n \nStephanie Woodard: \nRecognizing  that  we  have  time  constraints  today,  you  have  been  provided  with  slides \n[Exhibit E] as well as with a few final slides on the two previous presentations which provide \nsome links to additional resources that may be helpful if you wish to learn more about any  of \nthe topics we discussed today. \n \nWe will now look at behavioral health in Nevada and the impact of COVID-19.  It is \nimportant to recognize that COVID-19 as a pandemic is considered a disaster.  Looking at \nhow we can best estimate the impact of COVID-19 on behavioral health in Nevada and \ninternationally, we have had to look at an existing body of research that helps us to better \nunderstand what the impact of previous disasters has had on behavioral health.  As a disaster, \nCOVID-19 has impacted virtually everyone in one way or another.  Individuals who have \nbeen most directly impacted may have the most adverse experiences when it comes to \nresponding  to  COVID-19.    We  have  looked  at  a  body  of  literature  related  to  disaster \nbehavioral health to help us better conceptualize what we needed to address in the response \nand recovery efforts [page 2].   \n \nMost disasters have a very clear beginning, middle, and end, and when they do, there is a \ntypical trajectory in which individuals will experience different types of stressors at different \nmagnitudes throughout their response and recovery time periods.  This is the best model we \nhave had in order to better anticipate what the impacts on behavioral health could be related \nto COVID-19 [page 3].  However, we recognize that there are some significant limitations to \nusing this model.  One of the primary limitations is that this model assumes that there is a \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 10, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nvery clear beginning, middle, and end to a disaster, and as we all know with COVID-19, it \nhas  had  a  very  prolonged  existence  in  Nevada  and  the  recovery—although  coming—is \nrelatively slow.  We also recognize that the recovery from an impact such as a hurricane or \ntornado tends to follow a normal trajectory where there is an opportunity for inventory and \ncommunity  cleanup  and  engagement.    However,  in  COVID-19,  we  have  experienced \nsomething that is very different.   \n \nOne of the best ways for us to conceptualize the impacts of COVID-19 is to look at the stress \ncontinuum [page 4, Exhibit E].  We recognize that there are different impacts depending on \ndifferent degrees of stress.  This includes individuals who are experiencing healthy amounts \nof stress all the way to individuals who have experienced incredibly prolonged exposures to \nhigh degrees of stress.  What we know from previous disasters is that individuals who were \nalready experiencing high degrees of distress prior to the disaster are most likely to continue \nto experience moderate to severe levels of distress during and post the disaster.  However, we \nalso know there are several impacts that a disaster can cause such as economic uncertainty, \nhousing instability, as well as grief from experiencing bereavement that can also contribute to \nhigh levels of stressor.  How long an individual is experiencing high degrees of stress can \nimpact  how  vulnerable  they  are  to  either  having  difficulty  in  coping  or  beginning  to \nexperience the onset of behavioral health conditions. \n \nWe  were  fortunate  in  Nevada  to  be  eligible  for  what  is  called  the  Crisis  Counseling \nAssistance and Training Program grant through the Federal Emergency Management Agency \n(FEMA) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) \nafter the declaration of the emergency was approved in April 2020.  To formulate how we as \na  state  were  going  to respond  to the  behavioral  health  needs  in  Nevada  subsequent  to \nCOVID-19, we developed, along with FEMA and SAMHSA, this population exposure model \n[page 5].  This model allows us to better understand what the potential impacts are for \ndifferent populations, including vulnerable populations, so we could target our responses and \nresources based on the level of exposure or the potential for significant distress due to \nCOVID-19. \n \nAt the very bottom, we have prioritized those individuals who are bereaved or who have \nexperienced a hospitalization, recognizing that both those events could be incredibly difficult \nfor someone to manage.  We also prioritized frontline health workers, especially knowing \nthat we have been experiencing a considerable medical surge as of late.  We see that frontline \nhealth workers, as well as emergency responders, have really been shouldering a lot of the \nburden  related  to  the  response  to  COVID-19.    We  recognize  that  it  is  not  only  those \nindividuals who have been directly impacted, but the secondary and tertiary impacts that \nCOVID-19 has had on individuals.  This could also be loss of employment, students who \nhave been disconnected from school, and other individuals in the community who have been \nresponding to COVID-19. \n \nWe have been able to respond in a number of different ways [page 6].  Some highlights from \nour response and recovery activities include training well over 700 people in psychological \nfirst aid.  We have worked with the Nevada Hospital Association on engaging hospitals in \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 10, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \ncrisis  standards  of  care  around  behavioral  health,  crisis  services,  and  emergency  room \ndiversion.  We have worked to establish 24/7 psychiatric triage centers for children, adults, \nand adolescents to help divert them from emergency rooms.  We have developed some \nprogramming  and  public  service  announcements,  including  our  \"Home  but  Not  Alone\" \ncampaign,  to  get  the  message  out  to  help  individuals  understand  where  resources  are \navailable should they need them. \n \nStarting in March 2020, within DCFS and DPBH we developed a behavioral health task \nforce that began to look at some of the data available to help us better understand what the \nimmediate needs and impacts were so we could develop our response strategies [page 7, \nExhibit E].  Collectively, we authored the COVID-19 behavioral health recovery plan in May \n2020.  The plan spans a number of different areas we had identified as priorities with an \nemphasis on promotion, prevention, and early intervention.  It also helped us identify, if we \nreceived additional federal funds, which we have, how we would plan to allocate that funding \nto some of the highest needs. \n \nThe Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program [page 8] funded the development of \nthe Nevada Resilience Project, which has allowed Nevada to hire a number of resilience \nambassadors statewide, with a focus on intervening and providing promotion, prevention, \nand early intervention for individuals who are struggling with stressors related to COVID-19.  \nThis helps us direct them to needed resources as well as to reduce stress and build on coping \nskills.  We have worked with a number of community partners including the Human Services \nAgency of Washoe County, the Boys & Girls Club of Truckee Meadows, the Boys & Girls \nClubs of Southern Nevada, and a number of other community organizations to ensure that \nour resilience ambassadors are available statewide when and where an individual needs \nadditional support.  With that, I will hand it over to Dr. Freeman. \n \nMegan Freeman: \nI am going to talk now about the state of youth mental health in terms of mental health needs \nbefore the pandemic, and what some of the impacts of the pandemic have been.  The \"State \nof Mental Health in America\" is an annual report produced by Mental Health America, a \ncommunity-based nonprofit utilizing national survey data.  As you can see, Nevada typically \ndoes not fare well in the youth rankings [page 9].  We have been 51st for the past three years, \nand the same is true for the overall rankings.  On Monday, you heard from Public and \nBehavioral Health Deputy Administrator Julia Peek that, throughout public health in Nevada, \nif there is a list that is good to be at the top of, we tend to be at the bottom.  In the youth \nsection of the Mental Health America report there are seven indicators that make up these \nrankings.  These indicators fall within the core general topic areas listed here.  Our biggest \nareas of difficulty are in access to care and prevalence of substance use disorder among \nyouth.    These  are  very  actionable  concerns  and  can  be  addressed  with  investments  in \nscreening, prevention, and early intervention.  However, it will take resources and time to \nmove the needle on these rankings. \n \nThe Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System is a population-level survey supported by the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and designed to monitor health risk \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 10, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nbehaviors,  identify  health  disparities,  and  monitor  the  effectiveness  of  public  health \ninterventions.  The most recent data were collected in 2019 by the University of Nevada, \nReno.  We do our own version of the survey here and sample more widely than the CDC \ndoes.  The data were collected at all regular public, charter, and alternative high schools and \nmiddle schools in Nevada.  This slide [page 10, Exhibit E] draws attention to some of the \nmost important behavioral health findings from the survey, including up to two in five youth \nstruggling with significant feelings of depression, up to one in five youth having seriously \nconsidered suicide in the past year, and one in five youth engaging in self-harm.  On this \nsame survey, 15 percent of middle schoolers and 56 percent of high schoolers reported that \nthey never or rarely got the kind of help they needed when they felt sad, empty, hopeless, \nangry, or anxious.  This data is consistent with our core national rankings on access to care.   \n \nOn this next slide [page 11], you will see the top ten diagnoses most commonly associated \nwith Medicaid billing for behavioral health for youth ages 0-18.  These are 2019 numbers, so \nthis was prior to the pandemic.  For the sake of time, I will leave this for reference, but you \nwill notice that mood and anxiety disorders are prominent.     \n \nThese are some of the risk factors and stressors that youth and families are coping with right \nnow [page 12].  I want to emphasize that isolation and loneliness are associated with risk of \nfuture  mental  health  problems,  most  commonly  depression.    However,  while  youth  are \nreporting increased anxiety, depression, and stress right now, some teenagers are actually \nreporting increased life satisfaction which they say is because of more time for sleep, more \ntime with family, and protection from some of the stressors of regular in-person life, like \nbullying. \n \nOne of the major concerns that has been well documented throughout the pandemic is the \nlack of adult eyes on children who would normally be interacting frequently with teachers, \nschool staff, pediatricians, coaches, faith leaders, and in lots of other arenas.  We have seen a \nsignificant drop in calls to child protective services (CPS) from educational professionals in \nschools.    However,  over  time,  we  have  started  to  see  more  calls  coming  in  from  law \nenforcement and other professionals such as physicians.  Total call numbers have returned to \noverall seasonal patterns at a slightly decreased rate compared to prior years [page 13].  I see \nthis as an overall systems success as our communities have adjusted to the needs and current \ncircumstances. \n \nThis graph shows calls to our children's mobile crisis response hotline [page 14].  You will \nnotice the same general pattern as the CPS hotline calls—a large decrease at the onset of the \npandemic followed by a gradual return to regular seasonal patterns.  For mobile crisis, the \nreturn to normal happened when children returned to school in the fall.  This actually caused \na spike in need, but it has remained high since that time. \n \nThis slide shows a change in the hospital diversion rate for mobile crisis [page 15].  This is \nthe  number  of  youth  stabilized  safely  in  the  community  or  diverted  from  psychiatric \nhospitalization.  Initially, mobile crisis saw a decrease in hospital diversion, indicating that \nmore youth were being hospitalized.  The program reports that this is due to youth with more \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 10, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nserious levels of risk presenting for care and more difficulty in placing community supports \naround the youth due to isolation and quarantine. \n \nI also want to make you aware of a national trend reported by the CDC in the fall.  Although \nthe overall number of pediatric visits to emergency departments decreased by about 7 percent \nduring  lock-down  and  stay-at-home  efforts,  the  proportion  of  visits  that  were  related \nto behavioral health was 40-60 percent higher than normal during April through October \n[page  16,  Exhibit  E].    Most  emergency  departments  lack  the  appropriate  resources  for \nproviding behavioral health care, so we want to increase the availability of immediate in-\ncrisis care when and where youth and families need to access it. \n \nFinally, I would like to address the topic of youth suicide.  On the blue bars on this chart \n[page 17], you are looking at the total number of suicides for ages 0-17 for 2010 to 2020.  \nThe dotted line is the national suicide rate, which has been increasing steadily over the past \ndecade.  The black line is Nevada's suicide rate, which has been fluctuating around the \nnational rate. \n \nOn Monday, you heard a little bit about public health surveillance from Division of Public \nand Behavioral Health Deputy Administrator Julia Peek.  She talked about how typically \npublic  health  surveillance  does  not  occur  in  real  time,  and  youth  suicide  is  the  same.  \nAlthough I know this topic has been in the news and in all our hearts recently, our 2020 \nnumbers have not yet been finalized through the Office of Vital Statistics, so they could \nchange from what you see here.  It is too early to draw conclusions about how the pandemic \nhas changed the youth suicide rates in Nevada or anywhere.  What we do know so far about \nthe impact of the pandemic on suicide in Nevada is that our 2020 total is not out of the realm \nof what is normal for Nevada over the past decade. \n \nI am a parent.  One fatality is too many, and we strive for zero suicides, but I would like to \nencourage us as a public health system not to focus on fatalities as the only important \nindicator  of  the  burden  of  suicide  in  Nevada.    That  is  why  we  are  putting  into  place \nsyndromic surveillance at hospitals and urgent care centers to better understand the full \nspectrum of help-seeking for suicidal behavior.  This is monitoring of the number of visits \nwhere the person presents with a suicide attempt.  Additionally, we must continue to expand \ncrisis services and provide outreach so that children, youth, families, and individuals who are \nsuffering know where to go to get help.   \n \nStephanie Woodard: \nI will take a little glimpse into the Mental Health America report, this time specific to adults \nand mental health.  This report comes out annually and uses a number of different metrics to \nlook at the progress, or lack thereof, that mental health services are having in specific states.  \nHere you will see a number of different rankings [page 18].  The category of \"adults with any \nmental illness\" has continued to increase.  Where Nevada is about 20 percent, the United \nStates average is 19 percent.  In Nevada, the category of \"adults with a substance use \ndisorder in the past year\" is at 9 percent where the United States is 7 percent.  These data are \nfrom a study done in 2018.  One of the issues we have with these reports is because the data \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 10, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nis so outdated, sometimes it is very difficult to attribute what it is we are seeing in the data to \nwhat we are seeing in the state here and now.  But we do use these as indicators to be able to \nmeasure progress as we look at this data year over year. \n \nI also want to note that there have been some improvements in some of the areas related to \nadult mental health, including a reduction in adults expressing serious thoughts of suicide and \nadults with any mental illness who did not receive treatment.  We actually have increased the \nnumber of individuals who may have needed treatment and did receive treatment.  As for \nadults with cognitive disability who did not see a doctor due to cost, we have seen a good \nreduction in those numbers, which has enhanced our scores here.  The reason I think it is \nimportant to discuss these data is because far too often we hear people use the shortcut that \nNevada ranks fifty-first, but there are a lot of nuanced data points that go into that overall \nranking.  It is important to look in a more detailed fashion to understand what could be \ndriving some of our rankings [page 19, Exhibit E].  As was pointed out, the rate of suicide in \nNevada in 2020 specific for youth was not unusual compared to years past, and we see \nsimilar trends across all age groups including adults and individuals aged 65.  Again, I want \nto caution that these data are preliminary and subject to change.   \n \nWe have experienced an increase in opioid overdose deaths over the course of COVID-19 \n[page 20].  We had seen a relatively steady reduction over the last few years, but now we \nhave seen the highest rate we have had in the past decade with 484 fatalities in 2020.  There \nare a lot of reasons why this could be, not the least of which are increase in isolation and lack \nof access to care.  In November we had a red alert through the national drug helpline which \nnoted that Nevada had a 50 percent increase in overdose deaths between the first and second \nquarters of 2020.  Much of this is driven by non-COVID-19-related issues, including the \nproliferation of synthetic opioids including fentanyl.  We have been seeing this troubling \ntrend growing nationally even pre-COVID-19, but we realize that COVID-19 could have had \na significant impact in changing some of these numbers in Nevada.  We have also seen an \nincrease in emergency room (ER) utilization rates for individuals with suspected opioid-\nrelated emergency department encounters.  We had a 26 percent increase in 2020, while the \noverall drug-related emergency department use increased only 3 percent.  So, while we saw a \n3 percent increase overall, the vast majority—26 percent—was related to opioid overdoses.  \nWe are seeing an increase in utilization within Medicaid for substance use disorder, and we \nsaw  a  pretty  significant  increase in  2020  for  individuals  in  the  Medicaid  programming \naccepting substance use disorder treatment services [page 21]. \n \nWe have been watching very closely a number of different indicators to help us better \nunderstand what is happening with traditional behavioral health service utilization.  We have \nnot seen a very significant increase in overall utilization during COVID-19 [page 22].  There \nare a number of different reasons for this, not the least of which is that we did have a \nsubstantial time period where we had stay-at-home orders, and we know that individuals \nhave been avoiding care.  We also know that, following disasters, we typically see an \nincrease  in  need  for  traditional  behavioral  health  services  between  12  and  18  months \nfollowing the anniversary of the appearance of the disaster.  We anticipate that we may see \nincreased needs for services moving forward following March 2021.  We have seen an \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 10, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nincrease in crisis services.  We have seen a 170 percent increase in calls to the warm-line and \nincreases in both acuity and the length of calls for our lifeline for crisis support services of \nNevada.  Through the Nevada Resilience Project, which is about promotion, prevention, and \nearly intervention, we have been able to serve almost 73,000 individuals statewide since \nJune.  Our COVID-19 ER grant recipients who are providing crisis triage and inpatient \nservices have seen an approximately 100 percent increase year over year in individuals \nlooking to access care.  We continue to watch and monitor to see what the impact could be \non overall traditional behavioral health services, and currently, we have not seen a significant \nincrease.   \n \nWhere  we  have  seen  a  nice  change  is  in  telehealth  [page  23,  Exhibit  E].    Telehealth \nutilization for behavioral health services helped with continuity of care for individuals who \nhad previously been engaged in behavioral health services.  But we also saw a marked \nincrease in individuals who initiated treatment services utilizing telehealth.  Pre-COVID-19, \napproximately 24 percent of individuals had had their initial visit via telehealth, and that \nmoved to 41 percent of initial visits during the six months following March 2020.   \n \nThere is certainly a lot of work to do in the road ahead [pages 24 and 25].  We have to \nrecognize that there is a risk for increased and severe distress as it relates to our economic \nrecovery; the more prolonged this recovery is, the more likely that individuals will continue \nto experience distress.  We have to recognize there is a risk for increased suffering among \nchildren, parents, and caregivers due to isolation, loneliness, and stress related to school \nclosures as they persist.  We must address the needs for individuals who are struggling to \ncope  and  manage  with  new  or  ongoing  stressors,  and  recognize  the  opportunities  for \nprevention and early intervention as recovery continues. \n \nSome of our priorities are to prioritize basic systems that help keep people safe and secure, \nfocusing on social determinants of health such as economic factors—food security, housing \nstability, access to health care, and access to education.  We need increased capacity to \nprovide school-based behavioral health care for children.  We need to continue efforts to \npromote, prevent, and intervene early when individuals are having difficulty coping; provide \ncrisis services for individuals and families when and where they need them, to include \nsuicide prevention; and continue efforts to build community and family resilience. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nYou did an amazing job, and I know I asked a lot by asking you to consolidate everything \nthat is going on in this mental health field.  We do have a couple of questions. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nI echo what the Chair said about getting all that information to us in such a shortened period \nof time.  I have a question related to your data.  Are there any data gaps you have identified?  \nWe need to ensure that we have all the information we need to develop response policies, to \nbe certain we are getting those resources to children and families when and where they need \nthem. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 10, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nMegan Freeman: \nAn amazing thing about Nevada is that we are collecting a ton of data on children.  We have \ndata on crisis teams, and we get a lot of data through the schools.  There are a couple of \ndifferent initiatives on collecting data through the schools.  Right now, we need to focus our \nefforts on suicide prevention.  We would like to be getting more real-time information from \nhospital emergency departments and urgent cares about individuals across the lifespan who \nare presenting with suicidal behaviors.  That will help us understand in more recent or more \nreal time what the needs are and who has the need—where we need to focus our prevention \nefforts. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nThat is great to hear.  I have been working with Dr. Woodard on a bill that I hope will help \nallow us to fill that data gap in particular. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI  appreciate  Dr.  Woodard  and  Dr.  Freeman  presenting  today.    I  know  it  was  a  lot  of \ninformation in a short amount of time.  I have questions regarding slides 8 and 18 [pages 8 \nand 18, Exhibit E].  Nevada continues to be fifty-first in all those data points—the worst of \nthe worst, as you pointed out.  This is my fourth session.  I have seen presentations every \nsession because I have been on this Health and Human Services Committee each time.  We \nare not moving that needle at all.  Each time we hear these presentations, we talk about \ncollecting data.  At some point, we have to make some changes because, before I am termed \nout, I would love to see some of those needles moving and that there is some improvement.  \nI have not heard anything more than that you are collecting more data.  I am not hearing any \nsolutions.   \n \nI would like to know whether the number of childhood behavior specialists has increased.  \nWhat are we doing about reaching out and educating folks so that we can get more providers \nso there is more access to care?  I know we have more Medicaid recipients signed up, but \nthat does not mean there is better access to care, and I have huge concerns about that.  At \nsome point—you may not have that today, and we are limited for time—but I would like to \nsee the number of providers available in your system.  What are we doing to outreach?  Are \nwe using reciprocity to get these people licensed so there will be more access?  That is my \nfirst question—what are you doing for the specialists these people see? \n \nMy  second  question  concerns telehealth  data.    You  said  we  have  increased  the  use  of \ntelehealth from 24 percent to 41 percent, but that does not mean there has actually been \nincreased access to care.  It means that maybe the individual was unable to get into the office \nand might not otherwise be going to see that provider unless it was via telehealth.  I do not \nknow that is actually a greater percentage of access, so I would like to see some data on what \nwe are actually doing to have folks get access to care.  At the end of the day, follow-up \naccess to care, getting into treatment programs, and having specialists available for adults \nand children is really when we are going to start solving these problems, so perhaps you can \nget us more information on the actual providers. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 10, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nMegan Freeman: \nI will briefly speak on your question and then it might be best for me to take this back to our \ndivision leadership, and they can submit more information to you in writing.  One thing I will \npoint out is Mental Health America reports in any given year are based on data that was \ncollected three years prior.  It is very possible that we have made strides in the past three \nyears that will not be reflected until we see the rankings on future years' reports.  We have \nbeen working to expand our system of care in Nevada.  I think that is very significant for \nchildren, and we just may not be seeing those numbers reflected yet in the report; however, \nwe will submit a response to you in writing regarding your questions about providers and the \nother aspects of your questions. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank you.  I do not think there is a person in this meeting who does not want to see Nevada \nrise out of that fifty-first ranking in so many things, and I appreciate all you are doing. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nIs your department partnering with any national organizations or nonprofits to address some \nof the mental health issues throughout the state?  Do you have any certified nonprofit \norganizations able to go into the schools and give presentations to kids or do outreach and get \nthe message out that there are resources and help available so people know more about them?  \nIn southern Nevada, I am seeing a lot more open, frank discussion about mental health.  The \nmore support we have for those conversations from your department, the better we will be \nable to reach people in our community.          \n  \nMegan Freeman: \nWe would love to partner with you to understand more about what you are seeing.  We can \nget  you  a  list  of  our  community  and  national  partners  that  provide  us  with  technical \nassistance.  We seek a lot of support and technical assistance, but there is always room for \nimprovement, so we would love to have that conversation with you. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIf there is any other documentation you have, please provide it to our policy analyst, and he \ncan distribute it to all Committee members.  I also encourage everyone to reach out to our \npresenters.  Their contact information has been provided to you, so you may follow up with \nany additional offline conversations about what we can do in our state.  We will now move \non  to  our  regional  behavioral  health  policy  boards.    I  have  basically  asked  almost  the \nimpossible from our next presenters.  I have asked them to introduce themselves and give us \na five-minute presentation each, so we will begin. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 10, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nValerie  Cauhape  Haskin,  Rural  Regional  Behavioral  Health  Coordinator,  Rural \nRegional Behavioral Health Policy Board: \nThere is a handout in your packet [Exhibit F] that accompanies this presentation [Exhibit G] \nwhich  gives  far  more  detail  about  the  board  than  I  am  able  to  present  to  you  today.  \nThe Rural  Regional  Behavioral  Health  Policy  Board  represents  a  six-county  region \nin northeastern  Nevada  which  includes  Elko,  Eureka,  Humboldt,  Lander,  Pershing,  and \nWhite Pine Counties.  The combined area of this region is slightly larger than the state of \nMississippi, and the population sits at just under 100,000.  So, this large expansive space \ncovered by the region and the geographic distance of specialty services influences a lot of our \nboard's priorities.  The priorities seen here were adopted by the board in early 2020 and will \nbe revised and updated at the board's next meeting on February 24 [pages 2 and 3, Exhibit F]. \n \nOne of the major issues community members in our region face is transportation, both to and \nfrom behavioral health services.  This is the case for both crisis and noncrisis services.  While \na person in crisis may be able to get emergency transportation to in-person services in Reno, \nCarson City, or Las Vegas, our stakeholders have alerted us to many persons being released \nfrom emergency care without direct transportation home.  In those cases, they may be stuck \nin  the  city  where  they  were  released  or  sometimes  they  have  been  put  on  public \ntransportation for the return home, often without medication, food, or water, and, due to \nmultiple connections, this may take more than one day. \n \nInitially, the lion's share of the persons in our regions seeking behavioral health care services \nare either covered or eligible for Medicaid.  Thus, previous to the COVID-19 pandemic, it \nwas a priority of the board to seek improved Medicaid reimbursement for behavioral health \nservices to ensure the providers could maintain service levels to meet their needs.  Due to \nbudgetary cuts and concerns over the last year, that conversation has changed to preserving \nthe Medicaid services that are currently available. \n \nWhile most of the state can be considered health care service shortage areas, the issue is \nexacerbated in our frontier communities and is often even worse in regard to behavioral \nhealth services.  The board has prioritized seeking ways to improve the ability of local \norganizations to recruit behavioral health providers, including improving paths to licensure \nfor those who are moving to Nevada from out of state.  This is addressed in the board's bill \nthis legislative session, Senate Bill 44.   \n \nWhile  state  and  local  partners  have  made  great  strides  in  improving  data  quality  and \ncommunication,  this  is  still  a  persistent  issue  within  our  region.    Assisting  our  local \nstakeholders in improving the quality and accuracy of the data collected at the local level and \nhow it is communicated to state and other regional stakeholders is another priority of the \nboard. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 10, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nThe board has thought to increase its visibility in an attempt to better engage local, regional, \nand  state  stakeholders  and  increase  communication  regarding  current  resources  and \nchallenges.  The board prioritizes supporting programs that consider the needs of youth, \nelders, and families in a holistic approach, as issues within family units do not frequently \nhappen in a vacuum, and addressing the issues throughout the family circuit may have \nimproved outcomes. \n \nLast but not least, the Nevada Department of Veterans Services has made it known to us that \nour region has a comparatively high percentage of veterans within our population.  The board \nprioritizes efforts that improve the quality and access to services for those who have served \nour nation in the armed forces. \n \nWhile  many  communities  in  our  region  may  be  geographically  isolated,  they  were  not \nunaffected  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic  [page  3,  Exhibit  G].    The  information  we  are \ndiscussing here has been shared in community stakeholder meetings.  It should be cautioned \nthat many local organizations involved are focusing their limited resources on response, so \ndata available may not currently reflect these concerns.  Hopefully, they will be able to catch \nup as pressure from COVID-19 response subsides.  Also, please remember that in such small \ncommunities,  large  increases  may  constitute  small  numbers  in  comparison  to  urban \ncommunities.  However, with the already thin behavioral health services available, it does not \ntake much to overwhelm local resources. \n \nEarly on, our local hospitals saw an increase in the number of persons presenting to the \nemergency departments in crisis.  While some of these community members had presented to \nthe local hospitals in crisis before, most of them were experiencing mental health crises for \nthe first time.  This was followed by a sort of second wave of problems where hospitals were \nseeing  more  patients  who  were  presenting  for  reasons  related  to  increased  alcohol  and \nsubstance abuse, as well as increased intentional overdoses. \n \nOur local stakeholders have reported major concerns regarding increases in depression and \nanxiety among youth as well as frontline workers in health care, law enforcement, and other \nemergency health services.  Additionally, increased isolation among community members is \nleading  to concern,  but  even  more  so  for those  who  are  homebound  or  geographically \nisolated.   \n \nThat is my very brief introduction to the Rural Regional Behavioral Health Policy Board.  \nThank you for your time and if you have any questions or comments, I can be reached by \nemail. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you.  I appreciate your brevity.  I know this is a complex subject.  I will now move on \nto Ms. Dorothy Edwards who is with the Washoe Regional Behavioral Health Policy Board. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 10, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nDorothy Edwards, Washoe Regional Behavioral Health Coordinator, Washoe Regional \nBehavioral Health Policy Board: \n[Dorothy Edwards presented a PowerPoint Exhibit H and a summary sheet Exhibit I].  I will \nshare a few of the main priorities, action strategies, and some challenges that the Washoe \nRegional Behavioral Health Policy Board has identified for support and to expand throughout \nWashoe County [page 1, Exhibit H].  An analysis of where Washoe County is in terms of \nreadiness to stand up a crisis stabilization center remains something on which the board is \nfocused.  In response to the ongoing issue of individuals experiencing behavioral health \ncrises and often being taken to jail or emergency rooms inappropriately, these facilities are \nconsidered an emergency health care alternative.  The strategy for success for this state-\nsupported endeavor began in the 80th Legislative Session with the introduction and passage \nof Assembly Bill 66 of the 80th Session which addressed some components of this type of \nfacility.  During this biennium, our strategy for moving forward includes the completion of \nan assets-and-gaps analysis, a visit to one of the originators of the concept in Arizona, and \nincreased collaboration with partners in our state, city and county leadership to discuss the \nnext steps. \n \nWhile Washoe remains well-poised in some required elements, challenges to success include \nfinding sustained funding, infrastructure, and then developing the policies and processes \nrequired for collaboration between agencies [page 1, Exhibit I].  It does remain a strong \npriority in our county. \n \nA second priority is equitable focus on substance misuse [page 1].  While we know that \nbehavioral health encompasses mental health and substance misuse, there has been some \nconcern expressed that the focus of programs, funding, and policy might be inequitable \nbetween the two.  Understanding that the two are often co-occurring, we need to work to \nensure that there is inclusion and collaboration with all sectors of behavioral health.   \n \nStrategy for success began as we invited presenters from all sides of behavioral health \nincluding substance misuse treatment, prevention, and recovery, to provide information, \neducation, and solicitation for a change in legislation through a bill draft.  Several of those \nwere selected for the board's current bill, Senate Bill 69.   Our work and focus will include \nsupporting the development of a diverse, culturally appropriate, inclusive, and well-trained \nworkforce in both areas of mental health.  Behavioral health response before, during, and \nafter a crisis needs to be talked about [pages 1 and 2].  If we learned anything from this \npublic  health  crisis,  it  is  that  we  need  a  robust  plan  and  trained  staff  to  focus  on  the \nsometimes overwhelming behavioral health consequences of an emergent event. \n \nOur strategy in Washoe for success included participating in the resilience project.  Another \nstrategy was the development this year of a draft behavioral health annex to our regional \nemergency response plan.  We will continue to encourage and reach out to all organizations \nto take advantage of resources for training, such as in psychological first aid, with the goal of \ncreating community response teams to activate when needed during an event.  We look \nforward to conducting drills and exercises with local and state partners when it is safe and \npractical to do so.   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 10, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nThe Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) was actually developed by the Washoe \nCounty Health District [page 2].  It is a plan of action to address local conditions that are \ncontributing to or causing poor health in Washoe County.  Behavioral health is seen as the \ntop concern cited by the community, and one that greatly suffers from lack of adequate \nresources and an available workforce.  It also ties in closely to the housing focus area, as \nmany  chronically  homeless  individuals  suffer  from  mental  illness  and  substance  use \ndisorders, and adequate housing is seen as a critical foundation to providing successful \ntreatment. \n \nThe Washoe board committed its support of the behavioral health focus areas within the \nCHIP, which will include some robust and improved data collection and analysis, support \nand participation in the Built for Zero homeless initiative which is being implemented by \nWashoe County.  Challenges include the lack of housing and resources, along with a trained \nworkforce.   \n \nAs  we  have  all  talked  about  today,  the  board  understands  that  accurate  data  around \nbehavioral health is necessary to inform trends and assist in making decisions.  The annual \nRegional Profile is nearing completion as is the policy board's annual report.  Both will \ninclude the most recent behavioral health data available for state and regional comparisons.  \nA data website, or dashboard, is required for the regions, and Washoe continues to work on it \nwith a target completion date of this year.  I am happy to provide additional information on \nany of these subjects or on the reports I addressed, so feel free to reach out to me, and I will \nget you what you need to know. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe will move next to the Clark Regional Behavioral Health Coordinator, Teresa Etcheberry. \n \nTeresa Etcheberry, Clark Regional Behavioral Health Coordinator, Clark Regional \nBehavioral Health Policy Board: \n[Teresa Etcheberry presented a summary Exhibit J and a PowerPoint Exhibit K].  Clark \nCounty is one of the largest counties in Nevada.  To give you an overview, per the Office of \nthe State Demographer and the U.S. Census Bureau, the population in 2019 for Clark County \nwas 2,255,175 persons.  Clark County holds 73.6 percent of Nevada's population.   \n \nWe have a very diverse board.  Board members are well versed in behavioral health issues, \nand they hold different positions throughout the county on other boards [page 1, Exhibit J].  \nThey also share the demographics for our county. \n \nThe Clark Regional Behavioral Health Policy Board embraces a data-driven approach to \nidentify  the  behavioral  health  outcomes  and  system  gaps  of  the  region;  therefore,  the \nsuccess of the approach depends on the existence of data, the types of data, and the quality of \ndata gathered.  What we are looking for in our data are the gaps and challenges in our area \n[page 1, Exhibit J].  We need to collect civil commitment data, including details from law \nenforcement, transports by emergency medical services to hospital emergency rooms, the \ntreatment in the emergency rooms, and a summary of any transition to psychiatric services.  \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 10, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nWe also would like to know where people are placed and discharged and the length of stay \nfor those hospitalized and treated in emergency rooms.  This will guide the board in assessing \nthe after- and ongoing care, and in developing the different reports we have to produce for \nour stakeholders and the state. \n \nWorkforce development is another concern.  We would like to have an increase in the supply \nof providers in behavioral health.  The board recognizes that the availability of qualified \nbehavioral health providers is a concern here in Clark County.  While the region has seen \nsteady growth, our community still falls below the average of providers per capita.  The \nboard wants to further investigate what measures it could take to improve the behavioral \nhealth workforce supply in Clark County. \n \nRegarding data management and application, we are working on a data dashboard, but we \nalso need to have a data management system for Clark County, such as a health information \nexchange to provide access to behavioral health data and for the ease of use for providers and \nresidents of Clark County. \n \nThe big thing that happened in 2020 is the pandemic crisis.  We have seen an increase in the \nnumber of people seeking services on a national level as well as in Nevada.  As we heard in \nprevious  presentations,  we  have  an  increasing  number  of  adults,  youth,  and  children \nreporting symptoms of anxiety and depression, and we have had an increase in the number of \nsuicides.  We are also seeing disproportionate impacts on Blacks, indigenous people and \npeople  of  color,  and  on  other  populations  including  the  elderly,  individuals  with \ndevelopmental disabilities, residents of rural communities, and people living in poverty. \n \nThese concerns and challenges drive the board's priorities [page 3, Exhibit K].  As I spoke \nabout the priorities for mental health and workforce development, we also want to see \ndedicated  funding  for  crisis  services.    We  spent  many  weeks  working  on  Crisis  Now, \ngathering information, talking about a Crisis Now system.  We would like to expand our \nmobile crisis teams all over the county.  We have a large urban area, but we also have many \nrural areas that lack crisis teams.  The board also wants to increase community access to \ncrisis intervention, and we want to increase the stabilization of crisis services for after-care \nand ongoing services.  The board recognizes the behavioral health issues in our community \nand we must recognize the abuse of substance misuse and mental health and the use of \ntelehealth services. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nFinally, we will hear from Ms. Jessica Flood. \n \nJessica Flood, Northern Regional Behavioral Health Coordinator, Northern Regional \nBehavioral Health Policy Board: \nThis  region  includes  Carson  City,  Lyon,  Douglas,  Churchill,  and  Storey  Counties \n[Exhibit L].  Here is an overview of the regions, with my region circled [page 2].  These are \nthe members of the board [page 3].  Our board priorities have remained pretty stable over the \nlast five years [page 4].  By far, the top priority is obtaining sustainable funding for crisis \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 10, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nstabilization and jail diversion programs.  We have our mobile outreach safety team (MOST), \nwhich  is  a  co-responder  team,  our  Forensic  Assessment  Services  Triage  teams  are  jail \nreentry, and CIT is Crisis Intervention Team training for law enforcement—mental health \ntraining.  Our Mallory Behavioral Health Crisis Center is run through the Carson Tahoe \nRegional Medical Center and is our psychiatric emergency room.    \n \nOur priorities include increasing the behavioral health workforce with the capability to treat \nadults and youth, increasing access to treatment in all levels of care, increasing access to \naffordable and supported housing, and developing services to support continuity of care.  \nThat is looking at wraparound and community health workers. \n \nTo Assemblywoman Titus's point, we have seen some progress in our region, and it is quite \nexciting.  I spoke about the Mallory Crisis Center [page 5].  That has been really pivotal to \nhave  that  24/7  access  for  people  in  crisis.    We  are  also  very  lucky  to  have  certified \ncommunity behavioral health centers (CCBHC), and both Carson Tahoe and the CCBHCs \nhave assertive community treatment teams which provide this wraparound to people who are \nin serious mental illness.  Through those programs, along with our mobile outreach safety \nteams, we are seeing this incredible ability to identify individuals in crisis and get them into \ntreatment and stabilized in a way we have not seen before.  I was speaking to the MOST \nofficer in Carson City yesterday, and he was saying there were individuals who had been in \ncrisis for ten years who are now stable. \n \nDr. Woodard mentioned their emphasis on making jail reentry and criminal justice diversion \nevidence-based.  The state has done a lot of work with us to bring our jail reentry teams up to \nevidence-based practice, and we are very grateful for that.  So we think we are making \nprogress in developing this comprehensive mental health system bit by bit.   \n \nWhat we think is working in our region is that we have these local behavioral health task \nforces that provide community input into the northern board [page 6, Exhibit L].  We also \nhave a culture of collaboration in the northern region with a lot of organizations partnering \non grants.  Again, I have to give a lot of credit to the state.  We have been able to identify \ncommunity partners that are willing to expand their treatment services, and the state has been \nable to obtain some funding for those programs.  Along with that, the state provides quite a \nbit of technical assistance that has allowed our programs to, hopefully, achieve sustainability \nin the future. \n \nOur gaps and needs mirror our priorities [page 7].  We need access to care for youth and \nadults, especially youth.  I have received calls from parents who have insurance and, despite \ntheir  best  efforts,  cannot  find  treatment  for  youth  coming  out  of  inpatient  psychiatric \nhospitalization.  We need more behavioral health workforce.  It is inhibiting us from creating \nmore programs and expanding access to care.  We are rich in crisis lines, and we appreciate \nmany of them, but we have noticed that we still need in-person outreach for people who are \nin crisis, and that is in both the youth and adult perspectives.   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 10, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nIn our region we see a gap for supported housing, including group homes and long-term \nsupported living arrangements for people with serious mental illness.  As has been touched \non,  we  see  this  need  for  support  for  COVID-19-induced  risk  factors—isolation, \nunemployment, grief, and loss—and in particular for seniors.  We are seeing a lot of seniors \nand older adults who are in crisis and starting to need hospitalization due to the isolation. \n \nWe are working on regional behavioral health emergency operations planning.  We are trying \nto develop a website for the board that shows the data dashboard.  Our region is trying \nto educate  ourselves  about  what  regional  behavioral  health  authorities  would  look  like, \nrelated to taking the next step to regionalize mental health through these boards.  With these \nmulti-county arrangements, we find there is no central way to apply for grants or to bring \nfunding to the regions.  As a result, there may be a benefit to looking at formalization \n[page 8, Exhibit L]. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAt this time, I am not going to take any questions; however, I would encourage Committee \nmembers to contact our presenters if you have any questions. Prior to my participation last \nsession on this Committee, I was unaware of all these policy boards that exist in our state.  \nThey really are a resource about things happening regionally, particularly in your districts, \nand I highly encourage you to reach out to them.  They are the boots on the ground; they \nhave a better idea of what is going on locally, and can give you that information, especially if \nyou are looking at crafting legislation in the future in these areas. \n \nWe have two legislative measures being presented this afternoon, and I have allocated equal \ntime for testimony in support, opposition, and neutral for each bill after its introduction.  \nEach person providing testimony in support, opposition, or neutral will be given a maximum \nof two minutes, and staff will be timing them so everyone will have a fair opportunity to \nspeak.  We will limit the overall testimony to 20 minutes for each measure.  All testimony in \nsupport, opposition, and neutral will be over the audio lines to ensure fairness to all testifiers.  \nAnyone joining the meeting on camera is either a Committee member, staff member, bill \nsponsor, presenter, or staff from agencies to help respond to any questions we may have \nthroughout this hearing.  At this time, no one will be joining the meeting on camera.  I am \nopen to changing this policy to make certain we are as open and as transparent as we possibly \ncan be so as to engage as many members of the public who want to appear in the new format \nas possible.  I am working with broadcast services as well as with all of you to make sure we \nare able to do that fairly.   \n \nI will now open the hearing on Assembly Bill 62.  This bill revises provisions related to the \nNevada ABLE (Achieving a Better Life Experience) Savings Program.   Hopefully, you all \nhad an opportunity to review some of the legislation from the 2019 Session and the links we \nprovided to you on Monday.  \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 10, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \nAssembly Bill 62:  Revises provisions relating to the Nevada ABLE Savings Program. \n(BDR 38-397) \n \nZach Conine, State Treasurer: \nI am very excited to be here today to present Assembly Bill 62 which helps to innovate and \nstrengthen Nevada's ABLE Savings Program to ensure that Nevadans with disabilities have \nthe opportunity to save for a better future.  Broadly speaking, ABLE accounts are tax-\nadvantaged savings accounts that allow people with disabilities to earn and save money \nwithout losing access to vital programs like Medicaid and social security.  By making these \ntax-free  savings  accounts  available  to  individuals  to  cover  qualified  disability-related \nexpenses for things like education, housing, and transportation, the program aims to ease the \nfinancial  burden  faced  by  citizens  with  disabilities  who  are  the  most  underemployed \ndemographic group in the state. \n \nIn the 2019 Legislative Session, our office worked with Assemblywoman Cohen and the \nDivision of Aging and Disability Services to pass A.B. 130 of the 80th Session which moved \nthe entire ABLE Savings Program into the Treasurer's Office.  Since that time, our office has \nworked with hundreds of Nevadans with disabilities and their families to make sure they can \ngain access to these accounts without any impact or cost to the State's General Fund.  The \nprovisions of A.B. 62 would make Nevada the first state in the country to find innovative \nways to incentivize people with disabilities to open these accounts and build up account \nbalances to build their own great big, beautiful tomorrow.  I will now ask Erik Jimenez from \nour office to walk through the specifics of the bill. \n \nBefore I do that, I would like to mention the tremendous work Erik has done focusing on the \nABLE Savings Program over the last two years.  His singular effort has helped hundreds of \nNevada families, and he did that while helping me coordinate the largest recovery effort in \nthe state's history. \n \nErik Jimenez, Senior Deputy Treasurer, Office of the State Treasurer: \nPassage  of  the  ABLE  Act  of  2014  was  the  single  greatest  move  toward  disability \nindependence since the Americans with Disabilities Act.  When we took the program over \nfrom the Aging and Disability Services Division (ADSD) in 2019, there were a little over \n200 accounts with about $1 million in assets.  We have grown that to more than 1,000 \naccounts with over $6 million in assets, all using zero dollars from the State's General Fund.  \nWe do this for free.  It is not in the state's interest to make money on these accounts.  We do \nit so people with disabilities can save, possibly get out of bad situations, and build a brighter \nfuture.  Broadly speaking, we have a simple bill in front of you today, and I would be remiss \nif I did not thank Karly O'Krent from the Legislative Counsel Bureau for working with us on \nthe bill. \n \nThis bill modernizes our ABLE accounts to mirror our Nevada College Kickstart program \nwhich gives $50 to every kindergartener in Nevada to kickstart savings.  When I talk to \nfamilies about the benefits of ABLE accounts, one of the biggest barriers is earning an \nincome without losing their Medicaid and/or social security benefits, but they also do not \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 10, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \nhave the startup capital to open a bank account.  We would like to find some innovative ways \nto pay for seeding and growing these accounts that make them more sustainable for the state \ngoing forward.  The bill would authorize our office to promulgate regulations that would \nincentivize the opening of new accounts, similar to how we already do with Nevada College \nKickstart, and then to incentivize regular deposits from existing account holders.  So, if \nsomeone has an ABLE account and wants to start contributing, say $100 a month, how can \nthe state meet that person halfway and start to figure out how to match?  All of this we are \nproposing to not be funded out of the General Fund.  There would be no tax for this program; \nit would be done purely through private philanthropy and federal grant funding.  I want to \nthank some of the groups that have already expressed interest in doing that, particularly the \nNevada Bankers Association.  It has been a great partner in making sure we get awareness \nabout these accounts to the public. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any questions? \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nWhat is considered to be a qualifying disability? \n \nErik Jimenez: \nA qualified disability expense is any expense that is incurred as a result of living with a \ndisability.  It is intended to improve someone's quality of life.  When the bill was passed and \nsigned, the idea was to make the categories as flexible as possible so as to encourage people \nto save but also allow them to use these expenses for pretty much anything the individual \nwould encounter.  Those vary from education, health and wellness, housing, transportation, \nlegal  and  professional  fees,  financial  management,  employment  training  and  support, \nassistive technology, and personal support services.   \n \nI get asked that question a lot when I talk to families.  They ask things such as whether they \ncould open an ABLE account and use that money to take a trip to Disneyland.  We are trying \nto make the argument that, if it improves that individual's quality of life, better mental health, \nI could make an argument that it would be an eligible expense.  The goal is to make it as \nbroad as possible so these folks can spend this money just as anyone else would with their \ncheckbook. \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nWho qualifies?  What disabilities would qualify? \n \nErik Jimenez: \nThere is guidance from the Social Security Administration's \"blue book,\" but people with \nsignificant disabilities that occur prior to the age of 26 are eligible for an ABLE account.  In \nterms of disabilities, any intellectual development disabilities, autism, Down's syndrome, and \nthose sorts of things would qualify.  We work with the Nevada Justice Association on \nmaking sure that people with mental health disorders also can qualify for these accounts, but \nmost disabilities are covered under the ABLE Act. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 10, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nThank you for all the work you have done on the ABLE Program.  I have a question about \nsection  1,  subsection  4,  paragraph  (a),  subparagraph  (3),  \"Methods  and  incentives  to \nencourage contributions to a savings trust account.\"  Could you tell us more about what we \nmight expect to see when talking about \"incentives\"? \n \nErik Jimenez: \nWe wanted to be very deliberate insofar as we do not know how much money we will be able \nto bring in either from federal grants or from private dollars.  We did not want to commit in \nstatute to a particular dollar figure if we could not meet that dollar figure.  Assuming this bill \nworks its way through the process, we can secure some funding and then outline what that \nminimum threshold would be.  At this point, we are looking at between $50 to $100, and we \nwould  define  that  clearly  through  regulations  that  would  go  through  the  Legislative \nCommission.  But at this point, we are giving ourselves flexibility if that dollar number \nmoves around a little bit. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nMy assumption is that this would be a cash incentive for opening an account—perhaps like \nthe College Kickstart Program.  Is that what I should view as a frame of reference? \n \nErik Jimenez: \nI think that is exactly right.  We are continually working through this process, and I want to \nmake sure that we clarify in the regulations that our ABLE account program is open to \nanyone in the country.  It would be important to clarify this for the record that Nevada \nparticipants in this program would be eligible for the incentives.  While I appreciate people \nfrom other states participating in our program, our goal here is trying to help as many \nNevadans as we can. \n \nZach Conine: \nThat would match some of the work we do on the college savings front, where there are \nmatching programs available for individuals living in Nevada, even though the programs are \nbroadly available for everyone. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any other questions?  [There was no reply.]  I have one comment.  When we spoke \nabout this bill, you mentioned that this has not been enacted anywhere else, so this would be \na unique, innovative program.  Other people around the country would be looking at Nevada \nas a model in this area.  Can you speak to that? \n \nErik Jimenez: \nThat is why we wanted to bring this bill forward—to make it abundantly clear that the \nlegislative intent is to move forward with a program like this.  We would be the first program \nin the country to do something like this.  We are part of an alliance of states that administer \nABLE accounts, and I talk to most of them on a monthly basis.  The states of California and \nOregon are anxiously watching this bill to see if we are successful, because they would love \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 10, 2021 \nPage 27 \n \nto replicate that success.  Additionally, we have been in conversation with the United States \nSenate Special Committee on Aging and its chairman, who is from Pennsylvania.  They are \nalso watching us to see if this is successful.  If it is, they could replicate this on the federal \nlevel and do some sort of block grant into ABLE accounts to make sure we incentivize that \ngrowth. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI  see  here  that  you  are  going  to  develop  the  methods  and  incentives  to  encourage \ncontributions to the savings trust account but that there is also going to be an endowment \npiece.  I imagine that once you are successful—which we know you will be—in getting \ngrants into that main endowment, can you explain what that procedure will look like, in \nterms of distribution to those individual accounts?  Will it be a penny-for-penny distribution?  \nWill there be an administrative set-aside out of the endowment? \n \nErik Jimenez: \nConceptually, we want to figure out a way that we could find a dollar figure that works for \neither the initial contribution or the matching contribution.  Not using General Fund dollars, \nit could be really hard to do an exact penny-for-penny match.  We have some logistical \nthings to work out on our end since we would be the first state in the country.  Mechanically, \nwe want to streamline this so it is a little more effective than our College Kickstart program.  \nAs you are aware, Nevada College Kickstart is a separate ledger account.  The intention here \nwould be to make that contribution go directly into the ABLE account, so there are not two \nseparate accounts which would create more friction in the savings.  The seed money would \nbe earning interest, and then would be able to be used and saved by the individual. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nCould the individuals contribute to the savings accounts themselves?  We heard testimony \nfrom folks who had a small business selling popcorn that it would be counted against them \nwhen it comes to support for some of the social services they needed.  Would they put that \nmoney into this account? \n \nErik Jimenez: \nThat is 100 percent accurate.  Individuals with these accounts can save up to $15,000 a year \nwithout  losing  access  to  means-tested  benefits—food  assistance  programs,  Medicaid, \nSupplemental Security Income (SSI), and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI).  If one \nis  working,  for  instance,  Jack  with  the  popcorn  company,  Jack  can  save  an  additional \n$12,000 into his account.  The real benefit is getting people with disabilities to start saving, \nbut also to start working so they can live independently.  Twenty-seven thousand dollars a \nyear is really beneficial, and can get someone out of poverty.   \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThat is the thing I was most impressed by with this program, and why I am so supportive of \nit.  It is really enabling them to get a business going, and while doing that, not fearing they \nwould be kicked off the welfare system or their health care—things they need so desperately.  \nThank you for that clarification and thank you for bringing this forward.      \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 10, 2021 \nPage 28 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any other questions?  I do not see any more, so at this time, we will hear testimony \nin support, opposition, and neutral.  Again, to provide testimony, you have to register online \nat  the  legislative  website.    Registrants  will  receive  a  phone  number,  meeting  ID,  and \ninstructions on how to join the meeting.  Remember to clearly state your name and spell it for \nthe record and limit your testimony to two minutes.  Again, staff will be timing each speaker \nto make sure we are giving everyone a fair and equal opportunity to speak, and we will limit \nthis to 20 minutes. \n \nDora Uchel-Martinez, Private Citizen, Reno, Nevada: \nI am totally blind, and I absolutely support this bill.   Thank you to Erik Jimenez and Zach \nConine; you are awesome, as is Assemblywoman Cohen. \n \nConnor Cain, Vice President, Nevada Bankers Association: \nI am testifying on behalf of the Nevada Bankers Association in support of A.B. 62.  The \nNevada Bankers Association knows the importance of saving and has supported a number of \nbanking and savings opportunities for Nevadans.  We are excited to support Nevada's ABLE \nSavings Program as it makes sure that a person living with a disability is not penalized \nbecause that person is saving money.  We think the proposed changes outlined in A.B. 62 \nprovide even greater assistance for some of these savings accounts.  We are very proud of \nState Treasurer Conine and Mr. Jimenez for being leaders in this, not only in our state but, as \nyou heard, influencing policy around the country.  We would also like to recognize the fact \nthat these men have worked tirelessly throughout this pandemic to help countless Nevadans.  \nThey have been answering phone calls and emails late at night, working on the weekends and \nholidays, and they are still able to bring forward and tackle policy changes such as the one \nbefore you today.  We very much appreciate them and everything they do for Nevada and are \ngrateful for this opportunity to testify.  We encourage your support of A.B. 62. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any other people in support?  [There were no others in support.]  Is there anyone \nonline for opposition testimony?  [There were no callers in opposition.]  Are there any callers \nin the queue for neutral?  [There were no callers in neutral.]  Do you have any closing \nremarks? \n \nZach Conine: \nIn the interest of time, we will waive them. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 62 and open the hearing on Assembly Joint Resolution 1.  \nThis resolution amends the Nevada Constitution, and Assemblywoman Titus will introduce \nthe measure. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 10, 2021 \nPage 29 \n \nAssembly Joint Resolution 1:  Proposes to amend the Nevada Constitution to revise \nterms relating to persons with certain conditions for whose benefit certain public \ninstitutions are supported by the State. (BDR C-477) \n \nAssemblywoman Robin Titus, Assembly District No. 38: \nI  am  introducing  Assembly  Joint  Resolution  1,  which  proposes  to  amend  the  Nevada \nConstitution [Exhibit M].  This resolution is straightforward:  it changes four words in the \nNevada Constitution.  Some may wonder why we need to change the Constitution to address \nfour words.  Well, let me tell you what these four words are:  insane, blind, deaf, and dumb.  \nThese words are found in Section 1, Article 13 of our Constitution.  This section requires the \nstate to care for certain populations with disabilities or who suffer from a mental illness. The \nwhole section reads like this: \n \nSection 1.  Institutions for Insane, Blind, Deaf and Dumb to be fostered and \nsupported by state.  Institutions for the benefit of the Insane, Blind and Deaf \nand Dumb, and such other benevolent institutions as the public good may \nrequire,  shall  be  fostered  and  supported  by  the  State,  subject  to  such \nregulations as may be prescribed by law. \n \nI am aware that when the Nevada Constitution was written, different terminologies were used \nto describe persons with disabilities or a mental illness.  However, more than 156 years after \nNevada was admitted into the Union, it is time to give these words a more critical look.  We \nshould change them to contemporary language that is not deemed to be discriminatory or \nnarrow.  I propose we revise this terminology in the following manner: \n \n1.  from \"the insane\" to \"persons with a significant mental illness\"; \n2.  from \"the blind\" to \"persons who are blind or visually impaired\"; and \n3.  from \"the deaf and dumb\" to \"persons who are deaf or hard of hearing.\" \n \nThe idea to change this language in our Constitution came from one of my constituents, \nMr. Andrew Campbell, who will be joining me later for this bill introduction.  He works in \nthe Churchill County Middle School as a special education teacher.  Most of his students \nhave severe to profound disabilities.  Mr. Campbell also teaches American Sign Language in \nan after-school program, and he is very much aware of the needs of persons who are deaf or \nhard of hearing.  He describes them as smart and dedicated people in our society who work in \nbanks, are teachers or engineers.  His own grandfather belonged to this population and was \none  of  Boeing's  first  hundred  employees  who  designed  an  aircraft.    I  am  grateful  to \nMr. Campbell who brought this issue to my attention. \n \nLet me explain more about the details of my proposed amendment.  First, I want the new \nterms to start with \"persons.\"  We must stop categorizing people who suffer from an illness \nor disability by putting an emphasis on their illness or disability, for example, \"the blind\" or \n\"the deaf.\"  Instead, these are all individuals who happen to have an illness or disability, but \nfirst and foremost, they are \"persons.\" \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 10, 2021 \nPage 30 \n \nSecond, calling persons who have a hearing loss \"dumb\" in our own Constitution is plainly \noffensive.  This term must go.  Additionally, many people in our society are not completely \ndeaf but may suffer from different degrees of hearing loss.  The definition in the Constitution \nis too narrow, and, therefore, I think it should say \"persons who are deaf or hard of hearing.\" \n \n\"Insane\" is another one of those derogatory terms I recommend replacing.  We know that \nwords matter, and when you stigmatize individuals with such a term, it may lead to negative \nresults in the long run.  Research has shown that stigmatizing persons with a significant \nmental illness may create barriers for them.  They may face discrimination and prejudice \nwhen renting homes, applying for jobs, or accessing mental health services.  Stigmatized \npeople also are less likely to seek the help they need to treat their condition, which might \nmake their condition worse.  Using the term \"insane\" in our Constitution for people who \nsuffer from a mental illness helps to perpetuate this stigma.  Therefore, it should be replaced \nwith the more dignified term \"persons with a significant mental illness.\" \n \n\"Blind\" is not necessarily a discriminatory term, but I think it is too narrow.  If a person is \nblind, he or she may suffer a complete or nearly complete vision loss; however, this term \ndoes not include any of the people who have a visual impairment that causes difficulties with \nnormal daily activities, and which cannot be fixed by simply wearing glasses or contact \nlenses.  Persons with visual impairments may not be able to walk or read without adaptive \ntraining or the use of assistive technology.  Contemporary training and assistive technology \nprograms are for all people who have some kind of visual impairment.  Therefore, this \nlanguage should be updated as well, and I propose the term \"persons who are blind or \nvisually impaired.\" \n \nIn closing, I believe we must do a better job in making sure that we do not discriminate and \nstigmatize persons with disabilities or mental illnesses in our laws.  A first step is to ensure \nno discriminating, stigmatizing, or derogatory language is in our Nevada Constitution, and \nA.J.R. 1 will provide for that. \n \nPlease keep in mind, this resolution is just a first step.  It will not apply to the Nevada \nRevised Statutes (NRS).  For example, if you do a simple search in our law library on the \nlegislative website, you can find 67 hits with the term \"insane.\"  I hope there will be another \nopportunity soon to clean up our statutes as well.  I urge you to support A.J.R. 1 to end the \nstigmatization of our citizens in the Nevada Constitution. \n \nI might add that there has been a friendly amendment suggested; hopefully, the members \nof this Committee have a copy.  If not, I will read it, and we will make sure everyone gets \na copy.    This  amendment  came  from  Dena  Schmidt,  Administrator  of  the  Aging  and \nDisability Services Division in the Department of Health and Human Services [Exhibit N].  \nShe recommended, and I agree with her, that the new section 1 would read, \n \nInstitutions for the benefit of persons with a significant mental illness, persons \nwho  are  blind  or  visually  impaired,  persons  who  are  deaf  and  hard  of \nhearing,—and this is the friendly amendment, so it is not in the bill you \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 10, 2021 \nPage 31 \n \nreceived—\"or persons who have an intellectual or developmental disability,\" \nand such other benevolent institutions as the public good may require. \n \nI also might add that a number of members of this body in both the Senate and the Assembly \nhave asked to be joint sponsors with me.  If anyone else wants to sponsor this bill, I would \nwelcome everyone's name on this bill as cosponsors.  This was a prefiled bill, so I put it in on \nmy own, but I think this is something we all should embrace.  I will turn this over to \nMr. Campbell to make some remarks. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI believe that friendly amendment has been uploaded onto the Nevada Electronic Legislative \nInformation System so you all will be able to see it.  If this bill goes forward to a work \nsession it will be amended, so you may reach out to Assemblywoman Titus if you would like \nto be added on as a sponsor. \n \nAndrew Campbell, Private Citizen, Yerington, Nevada: \nThanks to Assemblywoman Titus for initiating this process.  It is one that is close to my \nheart.  I am here testifying today as a citizen of the state of Nevada and resident of Churchill \nCounty.  I have total deafness in one ear, and I have had total temporary blindness.  I know \nwhat it is like to live with that, and it is a challenge.  The fact that you are all attentive to this \nmatter, not only for myself, but for so many members of our community and families, is \nmuch appreciated as this goes forward. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there questions or comments?   \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI love the bill, its language, and its intent.  I was diagnosed with a hearing loss at age 30 and \ntold I would be deaf within 20 years.  That continues to progress, and I definitely do not want \nthese adjectives applied to me.   \n \nI am wondering about the conforming language where you talk about a change in statute.  \nThis is a change to the Constitution, and it will take some time.  If we have a successful \nconstitutional change, is that when we would look at the NRS for the conforming language to \nmake sure the statutes line up?  Would we need a proactive bill draft request or, once there is \na constitutional change, does it roll out on the back end? \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI would like to turn this over to our legal counsel to answer that question.  That is also why I \nam open to the process of getting the wording correct, because the wording has to be \nmatched next session, and the resolution needs to be passed again.  Then it has to go to a vote \nof the people to change our Constitution.  That is why it is so critical that we get it as right as \nwe can. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 10, 2021 \nPage 32 \n \nI know the wording regarding \"insane\" has been changed in prior legislative sessions, and we \nhave changed definitions, but we have never gone through the entire NRS and retrospectively \nchanged all that wording.  That would take a different bill, I believe. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nMs. O'Krent, could you answer these concerns? \n \nKarly O'Krent, Legal Counsel, Legislative Counsel Bureau: \nTypically, when there are issues like this in a bill, we would include something that would \nauthorize us to make the additional changes in the NRS when we are codifying things.  \nBecause this is a bill that does make a change to the Constitution and will have to be passed \nby another Legislature and then voted on, at the time it has been voted on, we would need to \nmake the changes pursuant to a separate bill that would then make the proper changes in \nNRS. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any other questions or comments?  I see in the chat that Assemblyman Hafen and \nAssemblywoman Gorelow would like to be considered as cosponsors as you are going \nthrough the potential amendment process.  I would like to be included as well.  As I said, \nI would encourage all Committee members, if you are interested, to please reach out to \nAssemblywoman Titus if you want to be included. \n \nAre there any additional comments or questions?  [There was no reply.]  With that, we will \nhear testimony in support, opposition, or neutral on A.J.R. 1.  We will begin with testimony \nin support. \n \nSteven Cohen, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \nI would like to say \"ditto\" to the bill's sponsor and to the copresenter's remarks.  I have one \nother friendly amendment, but I will address it offline.   \n \nLiz Davenport, Legal Legislative Extern, American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada: \nAs this bill removes derogatory and offensive language and provides modernization to the \nNevada Constitution, we support A.J.R. 1.  Legal terms must be updated so that they foster \nrespect for people.  Much too often, derogatory terms have fostered incorrect, negative social \nstigmas.    The  American  Psychological  Association's  Committee  on  Disability  Issues  in \nPsychology has emphasized the need to avoid offensive expressions and recommends placing \npeople  first,  just  as  Assemblywoman  Titus  explained.    Further,  when  derogatory  terms \nremain in statutes and constitutions, judges, lawyers, social workers, institutions, and others \nare  then,  unfortunately,  compelled  to  apply  these  pejorative  terms  when  applying  the \nconstitution.  The United States Congress recognized this over ten years ago, and in 2010 and \n2012, removed similar derogatory terms such as mental retardation and lunatic from the \nUnited States Code.  Similarly, as this bill removes derogatory and offensive terms from the \nNevada Constitution, we support A.J.R. 1. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 10, 2021 \nPage 33 \n \nJohn Piro, representing Clark County Public Defender's Office and Washoe County \nPublic Defender's Office: \nAs lawyers, we understand that language is important, and the language Assemblywoman \nTitus is seeking to change in this bill is stigmatizing and detrimental to people in our state.  \nWe thank Assemblywoman Titus for bringing this legislation forward, and we echo the \nstatements of the previous speaker.  We support this bill. \n \nBeth Jones, Private Citizen, Henderson, Nevada: \nI also have two callers on the line who registered to give testimony here today.  I will first \nintroduce my son, Harrison Jones. \n \nHarrison Jones, Private Citizen, Henderson, Nevada: \nGood afternoon.  I am nine years old.  I am hard of hearing, and I am representing myself in \nsupport of A.J.R. 1.  I do not think people called deaf or hard of hearing should be called deaf \nand dumb because it makes me feel like I am stupid.  I am on the advanced placement honor \nroll at Gordon McCaw STEAM Academy.  I am a blue belt in karate, and an actor in the deaf \nand hard of hearing theater program.  I am the opposite of dumb; I am smart.  If you are deaf, \nyou can do anything anybody else can do but hear.  Being deaf does not make you dumb.  \nThank you and have a good afternoon. \n \nAlexis Jones, Private Citizen, Henderson, Nevada: \nI am thirteen years old.  I am representing myself in support of A.J.R. 1.  I have severe and \nprofound hearing loss in both ears and wear hearing aids.  The terms deaf and dumb should \nnot be applied to deaf and hard of hearing people because we are like everyone else.  I have \nbeen in National Junior Honor Society for two years; I have gotten straight A's in all my \nhonors classes for all my years in middle school so far.  In elementary school, I won gold \nmedals in the science Olympiad; I was a tour guide for McCaw School of Mines and \ncontinually on the honor roll.  I testified for a different bill two years ago when I was eleven \nregarding deaf and hard of hearing kids.  I sat with Assemblywoman Titus two years ago \nwhen my family attended children's day at the Legislature.  I was in Girl Scouts for five years \nin the media/PR team and I served my community.  On top of that, I have been playing \nsoccer for over ten years.  When I am older, my goal is to be on the U.S.A. Women's \nNational Deaf Soccer Team.  I am an avid reader and can read over a thousand words per \nminute.  I have also been a part of the theater group for deaf and hard of hearing children for \nover six years.  I applied to a magnet high school and will be finding out if I was accepted \nnext month.  I can do many, if not all, things hearing children can do, so the term \"deaf and \ndumb\" is not applicable in this situation anymore.  It is not right to call deaf and hard of \nhearing people that term in the first place.  I am proud to be hard of hearing and in the deaf \ncommunity and to be here testifying to update disability-friendly language. \n \nWhile being hard of hearing has its setbacks, it has lots of advantages too.  If I had a choice \nto have normal hearing, I would not take it.  Having hearing loss is what made me the person \nI am today, and I would not change that for the world.  Thank you to Assemblywoman Titus \nfor sponsoring this amendment and for allowing me an opportunity to speak, and have a great \nafternoon. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 10, 2021 \nPage 34 \n \nJennifer Richards, Chief Elder and Disability Rights Attorney, Aging and Disability \nServices Division, Department of Health and Human Services: \nOur  agency  supports  A.J.R.  1,  and  we  are  thankful  to  Assemblywoman  Titus  and  this \nCommittee for shining a spotlight on this issue.  The language we use matters.  The terms \ncurrently in our state Constitution are pejorative, they are offensive, and they are a reminder \nof a very dark chapter in our state and nation's history for persons with these disabilities.  It \nwas a time of compulsory sterilization laws, discrimination, lack of accessibility, and other \natrocities.  The United States Supreme Court upheld compulsory sterilization laws for those \nwith intellectual disabilities in Buck v. Bell, 274 U.S. 200 (1927).  The Court held that \npersons with disabilities do not have a fundamental right to make private decisions regarding \ntheir family lives.  In delivering the decision, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., declared \nthat \"three generations of imbeciles are enough.\"  The use of this term emboldened other \nstates  to  adopt  compulsory  laws,  and  it  perpetuated  further  marginalization  and \ndiscrimination of persons living with disabilities for decades.  Since that time, passage of the \nUnited Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Americans with \nDisabilities Act (ADA), and other important legislation has helped usher in a paradigm shift \nfrom viewing persons with disabilities as objects of charity, medical treatment, or social \nprotection to full and equal members of society with fundamental human rights. \n \nAll of us at ADSD, and DHHS as a whole, care about the people we serve in our state and we \nstrive to use appropriate, person-centered language when providing those services.  Again, \nwe are very thankful to the Assemblywoman and to the Committee for addressing this issue. \n \nJamie Stetson, Private Citizen, Reno, Nevada: \nAcross the board I work for people who have different kinds of disabilities and I also have \nchildren who are on the autism spectrum.  This bill, in changing the language throughout our \nNRS, is so important to legitimizing and taking away the stigma for people with disabilities \nin our communities.  We have a significant lack of providers, a significant lack of ability to \naccess resources in our community, and having this kind of language remaining in our NRS, \nand this kind of language still being used in our state, is shameful and something that needs \nto be taken care of.  I am really grateful to see that something is being done about it.  \nI strongly support this bill and any other bill changing the disgusting language that has been \nused and that also supports people and creates fewer barriers to access and shows our \ncommunity members that we support them.  I appreciate the time you have taken to get this \nput forward. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there other callers in support?  [There were none.]  Are there any callers in opposition?  \n[There were none.]  Are there callers who want to testify in neutral?  [There were none.]  \n \nAre there any closing remarks, Assemblywoman Titus or Mr. Campbell? \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI would like to thank you all for hearing this bill.  I appreciate it and, as you could hear from \nthe testimony, it is very important.  To all Committee members who have reached out, I will \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 10, 2021 \nPage 35 \n \nadd your names, and when we hear this bill again, hopefully in a work session, we will add \nthose amendments.  I want to get this right, so if there are other suggestions, I am open to \nthem.  As you heard, we need to fix this, so thank you for all your time.      \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you so much for your presentation.  I would encourage Committee members to reach \nout to Assemblywoman Titus as she is working through this and preparing it for any work \nsession.  Anytime we have constitutional changes, we want to get them right.  With that, \nI will close the hearing on A.J.R. 1.  \n \n[Exhibit O was submitted but not discussed and will become part of the record.] \n \n Do we have any people on the line for public comment?   \n \nNicole Willis-Grimes, representing Special Olympics of Nevada: \nI apologize, I was not quick enough to dial in to support Assembly Bill 62.  I recognize that \nyou would prefer for public comment to focus on issues other than the bill, but I appreciate \nthe opportunity to quickly voice our support on behalf of Special Olympics of Nevada.  \nSpecial Olympics of Nevada is dedicated to enriching lives of children and adults with \nintellectual  disabilities  during  inclusive  sports,  education,  and  health.    We  very  much \nappreciate the State Treasurer and Mr. Jimenez's efforts on inclusive policy—especially \nfinancial inclusivity and providing a kickstart possibility for the ABLE accounts. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe are trying to be as flexible as possible and sometimes it is more difficult in this virtual \nand telephonic world, so that is fine.  \n \nAre there any comments from Committee members before we adjourn? \n \nDora Uchel-Martinez, Private Citizen: \nI was going to speak before, but I was not fast enough.  I really appreciate Assemblywoman \nTitus and Andrew Campbell for bringing A.J.R. 1 forward.  After 30 years of the ADA \npassing, I am glad we are on the right path.  Thank you for your time and for recognizing that \npeople with disabilities are people first.  We all have different abilities, and people with \ndisabilities are resilient; you might learn something from us. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 10, 2021 \nPage 36 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIs there anyone else on the line?

Committee rules and protocol were explained.]  Committee members, \nbefore we begin, please mute your microphone when you are not speaking to minimize any \nbackground noise.  Also, please turn your camera on and leave it on during the entire \ncommittee hearing.  Today, we have two overviews on Nevada's Children's Mental Health \nConsortia as well as an overview of Medicaid.  We also have one bill hearing.  We are asking \nthat all public comment be kept to two minutes, so everyone interested in speaking can be \naccommodated  and  we  can  ensure  we  get  through  this  agenda  in  a  timely  fashion.  \nAdditionally, we will limit the overall length of each public comment period to twenty \nminutes.  Speakers are urged to avoid repetition of comments and may submit any additional \ncomments in writing within 48 hours of the meeting adjournment.  You may see Committee \nmembers looking at multiple screens or electronic devices.  Please note that they are not \ntrying to be disrespectful.  We are all working in this virtual setting trying to refer to \npresentations or other written documents that we might have on various devices.   \n \nWe will now move on to our first agenda item. \n \nMegan Freeman, Clinical and Policy Advisor on Children's Behavioral Health, Division \nof Child and Family Services, Department of Health and Human Services:  \nThank you for this opportunity to follow up on our presentation concerning children's mental \nhealth.  Today, we are going to describe our children's mental health consortia in Nevada and \nhow they shape our children's mental health system [Exhibit C].  I am going to provide a \nbrief overview of how the consortia were established and how they function, then the chair of \neach consortium is going to take five minutes to describe its regional priorities and the recent \nimpacts of the pandemic on its region. \n \nHere [page 3] is a brief reminder of our agency vision and mission which we talked about in \ndetail last week.  As you know, Nevada has a bifurcated child welfare system.  This means \nthat in the urban counties, the county provides child welfare services, whereas in the rest of \nNevada, the Division of Child and Family Services (DCFS) is responsible for child welfare \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 15, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nservices.  This structure was established by Assembly Bill 1 of the 17th Special Session \nin response to concerns about the previous structure of the child welfare system causing \ninterruptions  and  delays  in  services  and  placements,  as  well  as  delays  in  permanency \nplanning which would cause the child to remain in the child welfare system for longer \nthan  necessary, among other concerns.  When this bifurcated system was established, the bill \nalso required the establishment of independent groups that would assess and plan for the \nmental health needs of children in Nevada.  These groups are the regional children's mental \nhealth consortia established for Clark and Washoe Counties and for rural Nevada [page 4, \nExhibit C]. \n \nThe consortia operate under system of core values and principles which we reviewed on \nWednesday last week.  They are family-driven and youth-guided, community-based, and \nculturally  and  linguistically  appropriate.    In  2010  and  again  in  2020,  each  consortium \nconducted a needs assessment in its region and submitted a ten-year strategic plan outlining \nthe priorities for its region and the strategies that would be used to achieve its goals.  Status \nupdates are provided to the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services \n(DHHS) and to the Commission on Behavioral Health in odd-numbered years.  In preparing \nthe biennial budget request for the DHHS, the Director is required to consider the consortia's \npriorities and any request for budget allocations.  The Director must report to the consortia \nwhich items from their priority list were included in the Department's request and explain the \nreasoning for any items that were not. \n \nOne of the features of a system of care approach is that youth and families are involved in \nevery level of governance [page 5].  This includes the children's mental health consortia as \nthe entities that drive the structure of our children's mental health system.  Each consortium \nhas a parent of a youth with behavioral health needs as a voting member, and typically, there \nare several more parents and caregivers in attendance at every meeting.  There is time set \naside  at  each  meeting  to  hear  parent  concerns.    In  addition  to  individuals  with  much \nexperience, each consortium consists of a representative from DCFS or from the Division of \nPublic and Behavioral Health, depending on the region, Nevada Medicaid, the region's child \nwelfare agency, the board of trustees of the school district, the local juvenile probation \ndepartment, the local business community, a provider of mental health care, a provider of \nfoster care, and a provider of substance use treatment.  Each consortium holds a monthly \npublic meeting, and some of the consortia have focus work groups that also meet monthly.  \nNow I will turn it over to the Washoe County consortium to go over that region's priorities. \n \nJacquelyn Kleinedler, Chair, Washoe County Children's Mental Health Consortium: \nIn March 2020, the consortium finalized its current ten-year strategic plan as required by the \nNevada Revised Statutes [Exhibit D].  We identified three overarching goals to guide our \nconversation, activities, advocacy, and our local and statewide data review strategies [page 6, \nExhibit C].   In our effort to begin the path toward realization of our shared vision of \nequitable and compassionate mental health care for all, we established our first goal to \naddress multiple ongoing and projected community needs in the coming years.  We have \nstarted conversations around what increased access, decreased barriers, and least restrictive \nenvironments look like, and what it would take to make resources with these characteristics \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 15, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \navailable to youth.  Achievement of this goal requires expansion of interrelated systems from \nprivate and public service agencies.  For example, for our school district to succeed in its \nefforts  to  colocate  services  in  their  schools  and  increase  collaboration  with  community \npartners, multiple local and state stakeholders must work together to provide the necessary \nresources to meet agreed-upon objectives. \n \nAs our discussion of goals took shape, we realized that primary, preventive support of \nfamilies and caregivers in their naturally occurring and overlapping systems is necessary.  \nThus, our second goal is centered around activities that educate community stakeholders, \nincluding parents, about toxic stress, and about ways to buffer children, build resilience, and \nstrengthen protective factors.  The foundation of the second goal lies in the compelling \nresearch  on  adverse  childhood  experiences  that  documents  future  potential  impacts  of \nunmitigated  toxic  stress  on  children  when  they  become  adults  and,  potentially,  parents \nthemselves. \n \nOur third goal embodies our shared value that children thrive when their family is thriving, \nand families thrive when their community is thriving.  With this goal, we will set out to \nbridge systems and identify key community factors that enhance physical and emotional \nhealth, safety, and well-being.  Each priority on this slide [page 7, Exhibit C] brings us a step \ncloser to achieving all three long-term goals.   \n \nThe challenges and opportunities of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to dominate our \nmeetings, considerations, and discussions.  We intentionally make space to hear the stories of \nmembers of our community and look for ways to amplify their voices in local and statewide \nadvocacy.  Through this process, we have come to understand that teachers and educators, \nsome of the key adults who we rely upon to guide and teach our children, are themselves \noverwhelmed with the stressors and demands of educating during the pandemic.  Many are \nexperiencing what can be characterized as toxic stress.  Thus, our attention has turned to \nadvocacy for our educators.  In late January, we penned a letter to the Superintendent of \nPublic  Instruction  and  the  Director  of  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services, \nrequesting various forms of support, waiver, and relief.  We believe that the adults who wrap \nlove and support around our youth must also be supported.   \n \nAlongside this effort, we continue to examine ways to shore up care of children to address \nincreased reports of anxiety and depression in our youth and to continue to fight against our \never-existing youth suicide epidemic.  Though the pandemic has highlighted and intensified \nexisting disparities in Washoe County around food, housing, and employment insecurity, it \nhas  also  allowed  a  particularly  unique  opportunity  for  adults  and  young  people  in  our \ncommunity  to  understand  the  importance  of  mental  health,  and  through  their  shared \nexperiences, to decrease the stigma around accessing mental health care. \n \nWe hope to press on this momentum and keep the attention paid to mental health at the \nforefront.  We hope to continue to normalize mental health needs and access to mental health \ncare as a necessary function of overall well-being.  In conclusion, I respectfully ask this \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 15, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nCommittee to keep our children and families in mind as you continue to proceed through the \n81st Session. \n \nPamela Johnson, Chair, Rural Children's Mental Health Consortium: \n[Pamela Johnson supplied additional information not discussed Exhibit E].  I am the parent \nof a child with a serious emotional disturbance.  He received treatment for approximately six \nyears  that  was  very  expensive  and  confusing.    As  a  nurse,  I  wanted  to  help  others \nexperiencing the same difficulty, so I decided to volunteer with the rural consortium.  In the \nlast two years, the consortium has had the highest meeting participation.  We offered a virtual \nplatform before the pandemic and we have representation from across rural Nevada.   \n \nThe rural consortium has five goals I will briefly discuss [page 8, Exhibit C].  The most \nsuccessful effort we have made is what we refer to as community discussions.  Before the \npandemic,  we  held  two  events,  one  in  Winnemucca  and  one  in  Tonopah.    We  asked \ncommunity participants about mental health efforts in their communities.  They addressed \ntheir successes and challenges.  Our goals were developed around community concerns. \n \nGoal 1:  The consortium members are participating in the DCFS Nevada System of Care \nExpansion Grant [Exhibit F].  The partnership is helping to improve and expand mental \nhealth services, specifically in rural communities.  Some of these expansions include respite \ncare, increased psychiatric services, and early childhood mental health services.  We also \nwork closely with peer support groups, including Youth MOVE Nevada, National Alliance \non Mental Illness, and Parents Educating Parents, Inc.   \n \nGoal 2:  There are limited providers in rural communities, and we facilitated partnerships \nsuch as with school social workers to promote early detection in schools.  We have helped \nprovide items to rural providers such as art supplies to carry out the goals of a youth's \ntreatment plan. \n \nGoal 3:  We are supporting the expansion and continued funding of the rural Children's \nMobile Crisis Response Team.  The service is now 24/7 and is often the point of entry for \nyouth and families.  In fiscal year 2021, rural mobile crisis has had an 84.3 hospital diversion \nrate, meaning that 84.3 of the youth we had contact with were able to be stabilized in their \nhome communities.   \n \nGoal 4:  The consortium supported and joined the system of care in offering training to over \n70 rural clinicians in becoming certified telehealth providers.  We are also working on a plan \nto bring health equity training to rural communities. \n \nGoal 5:  The consortium has completed a memorandum of understanding with the Nevada \nSystem of Care to serve as a designated point of contact for youth, families, and other \nprovider input.  We are also working with behavioral health policy boards in the rural and \nfrontier counties. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 15, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nRegarding the impact of the pandemic, the severity of symptoms seems to have increased in \n2020.  Youth are reporting more lethal, violent, suicidal thoughts such as hanging, jumping \ninto traffic, and firearms.  This is possibly due to the increase in isolation, but due also to \nincreased screen time during COVID-19 restrictions.  Families are needing more intensive \ncase  management.    They  are  struggling  to  provide  the  basic  necessities  such  as  food, \nclothing, and shelter, and these financial stressors are associated with COVID-19.  \n       \nFor youth needing to be hospitalized for safety, rural mobile crisis reports see longer wait \ntimes  in  emergency  rooms.    Perhaps  one  of  the  issues  is  COVID-19  testing  before \ntransporting.  A rapid test may not always be available; it would sometimes take days for test \nresults to came back so the youth could be transported. \n \nOur state continues to see a shortage of acute psychiatric hospital beds, especially for youth \nbetween the ages of 5 and 15.  Last week we had a ten-year-old who waited in the emergency \nroom for days before a bed was available.  Transportation continues to be an issue for rural \nfamilies trying to access mental health services.   \n \nThere are some strengths.  We have collaborated with the suicide prevention and rural mobile \ncrisis teams.  They have partnered to provide rural families with gun locks, medication safes, \nand prescription disposal bags.  Youth are getting outpatient services more quickly with the \nincrease in telehealth providers.  With more mental health services needing to be done via \ntelehealth, Medicaid has enacted an expansion that allows mental health providers to be \nreimbursed for telehealth and phone-health services at the same rate as inpatient services.  \nThis  expansion  has  helped  mental  health  services  in  rural  Nevada  flourish  during  the \npandemic.  The consortium is hopeful this expansion will continue even after the pandemic.   \n \nIt is our hope that this overview of our efforts demonstrates the importance of providing \nchildren's mental health services in all areas of the state.  Rural areas are challenging, but the \nlessons of the community discussion events demonstrate the pride each community takes in \ntheir efforts with other stakeholders to provide children with the needed health care in their \nown communities. \n \nDan Musgrove, Chair, Clark County Children's Mental Health Consortium: \n[Dan Musgrove submitted additional information not discussed Exhibit G].  I have been \nworking on mental health issues locally and with the state Legislature for over 20 years.  \nI would like to call your attention to this slide, which is our strategic plan's overarching goals \n[page 9, Exhibit C].  There are six of them.  In 2001, the Legislature created the local \nconsortiums.  There is also a statewide consortium I work with that includes the members of \nboth Washoe County and the rural counties.  Much of what you have already heard from \nWashoe and the rurals is happening in Clark County as well, but probably to a greater degree \nbecause of our larger population. \n \nOn this slide [page 10] is the progress being made on the top four priorities of the Clark \nCounty Consortium, and particularly on Nos. 3 and 4.  There is a current investigation being \nconducted by the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice dealing with \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 15, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nwhether the State of Nevada is unnecessarily relying on institutionalization to treat children \nwith behavioral health conditions.  When you look at our Items 3 and 4, those are issues we \nhave seen for a number of years that we believe could have helped to deal with that issue.  \nThe benefit of these consortiums lies in their membership, and it includes state agencies, \ncounty agencies, the school districts, and parents.  All of them are tremendous advocates on \nbehalf of children.  But as we know, dealing with budgets and restrictions and sometimes just \nan inability to move the needle, sometimes things get out of hand, and I think we have an \nissue of over-hospitalization.  Also, we do not have capacity here in the State of Nevada.  We \ndo not want children to have to access long-term treatment:  we want to see wraparound care \nand mobile crisis teams—those are all items we hope would keep kids out of long-term \nresidential treatment facilities.  However, in Clark County, we do not have a lot of beds.  The \nmajority of beds are in Reno or out of state which does not help kids or families at all.  As \nyou can see in our Items 3 and 4, we need more service array options because we have not \nseen progress.  \n \nDuring the 2015 Session, Assembly Bill 307 of the 78th Session was passed in both houses \nand that attempted to address many of these issues.  It was a pilot program that would have \nlooked  at  the  intensive  care  coordination  services  for  children  with  behavioral  health \nneeds who reside in Clark and Washoe Counties.  The funding, however, was never there, so \nA.B. 307 of the 78th Session never was implemented or tried.  Maybe we would have seen \nsome help in those areas.  It is all about having a complete service array to help children and \nfamilies. \n \nAnother thing the Chair wanted us to talk about was the impact of COVID-19.  We already \nhave  a  stress  system  that  has  an  impact  on  youth  and  families.    These  children  have \nexperienced everything:  fear, grief, loss of loved ones, anxiety about COVID-19, the issues \nof  their  own  family  finances,  dealing  with  online  learning,  the  isolation,  the  disrupted \nrelationships.  Imagine children with disabilities and mental health needs having to deal with \nthe additional burdens of remote learning as parents and their caregivers attempt to meet their \nneeds in a home setting, in the absence of having a lot of the necessary supports and services \nthey normally would have. \n \nWe have received lots of testimony from parents and mental health professionals about the \nmethods schools are using to hold kids accountable, and it is harmful to these students.  We \nsee reports that schools are being punitive in the online environment.  Students are already \nexperiencing stress and anxiety about lower or failing grades, but they are receiving warnings \nthat they might be retained; they are getting tired of uncomfortable screen time and threats of \nclass failure, and threats of not even graduating. \n \nWe in Clark County have recognized the extreme challenges faced by the children and we \nbelieve you have to work on strategic and sustained planning efforts to help develop more \nsystems of care for these children especially.  The effects of the pandemic will be long-\nlasting, especially in the absence of adequate service array, so the mental health of children \nand their families needs to be prioritized.  And, above all else, compassion and understanding \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 15, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nare needed so students and families feel supported, rather than punished, for this situation \nthat is not within their control. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWhen I asked the children's mental health consortia to present, I asked them to highlight \nsome of the key issues and priorities for their regions.  Are there any questions?   \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nMs. Johnson, could you send your rural consortium's list of goals, please? \n \nPamela Johnson: \nAbsolutely, we can do that. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nMay I have some specifics about some of what you all reported?  When you are speaking of \nincreases in suicidal thoughts, are these children who are already receiving services in your \nconsortiums or are these new children who are now seeking help?  Who is collecting and \ntracking this data? \n \nPamela Johnson: \nIt is all the things you have mentioned—they are new, they are children in service, and they \nare also family members.  We get the information from suicide prevention centers and \nmobile crisis units. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nIs there a standard vetting procedure for this data, this intake?  I hear about the increases, but \nI want to be sure we are gathering this data in a manner that is quantifiable so we can refer to \nit with confidence.  Then we would be able to find resources and act on it because we have \ndata that has been collected in a manner that is consistent with some kind of metric that is \naccepted in the industry. \n \nJacqueline Kleinedler: \nOne of the problems we see is the scattered approach to data collection about the topic of \nincreased reports of anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts among youth.  One of the \nways the consortium is addressing this is to pull from multiple data sources.  We ask \ndifferent agencies in our community that work directly with youth.  We invite them to give \npresentations.    For  example,  the  Human  Services  Agency  of  Washoe  County  gives \npresentations,  The  Children's  Cabinet  gives  presentations,  and  Quest  Counseling  and \nConsulting gives presentations.  We ask the school district to attend meetings, and they share \ninformation with us.   \n \nTo my knowledge, there is no standardized mechanism for collecting data.  There is also a \nlag between when the data is collected and presented and when we are able to formulate a \nresponse to that information.  Your question about data is important and an area where we \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 15, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \ncould use a lot of support in figuring out how to track, how to report, and how to respond to \nthe trends we see. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nI spoke with an organization not long ago about this issue.  They told me they use Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) data.  Have you considered adopting that metric, that \nprocess, so that each of the organizations that are reporting to your consortium are using the \nsame standards?  That way we would have something consistent to refer to.  We are hearing \nconflicting things.  I am a brand new legislator; I am learning every day; but I am hearing \ndata from one hand and then the other on an issue that is this serious and requires action.  \nPeople from different perspectives are putting forth their data and if it is not consistently \ncollected, I do not know if that data is being presented in a manner that is for the individual \nor the organization's benefit, or if it is for the benefit of all.  I want the data I receive to be \nconsistent, so I know how this is affecting everyone, not an organization or institute that has \na motive—except that they care about the kids.  That is what I am concerned about. \n \nMegan Freeman: \nThere is a survey taken here in Nevada called the \"Youth Risk Behavior Survey\" that is \nconducted using the CDC criteria.  It is conducted by the University of Nevada, Reno, and in \n2019 every Nevada middle and high school participated in that survey.  That is an amazing \nsource of data.  I do not know whether any other places try to survey every eligible youth in a \nstate.  They will start data collection on the 2021 survey in the fall.  It was scheduled for the \nspring, but was pushed back due to the pandemic.  I would be happy to make sure you have a \ncopy of some of the recent findings from that survey. \n \nI also want to talk about data from different agencies, including children's mobile response.  \nUsually that is data that is collected in the course of routine clinical care.  Typically, that is \ncollected in a different way for a different purpose than epidemiological data, like what is \ncollected by the CDC, and so the questions will be asked in a slightly different way because \nit is done for a different purpose.  There are complementary approaches, and we want to \nmake sure to use both so we have a comprehensive understanding of the problem and how to \naddress it. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIf there is any additional information, please get that to Patrick Ashton so he can distribute it \nto the entire Committee. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank you for your presentations.  I appreciate all you are doing, all you are trying to do, and \nthe challenges ahead of you.  I want to make sure all the consortiums, Washoe, rural, and \nClark, are communicating with the other mental health consortiums so that we are not \noperating in silos.  I have not heard of any joint ventures.  I would like to know that you are \ncommunicating with the other behavioral health care boards, the other mental health boards, \nand not living in separate silos. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 15, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nDan Musgrove: \nI can speak on behalf of Clark and some of the other consortiums.  As you know, we are \nadvocates for children and we have a responsibility to prepare these reports.  We provide \nthem to both the Commission on Behavioral Health as well as to Director Whitley of the \nDHHS.  Two other members of the Clark consortium and I also serve on the Clark County \nRegional Behavioral Health Policy Board.  A number of the other regional policy boards \nhave ceded the work on children to the consortiums, and we report what we are doing to the \nregional behavioral health policy boards.  That way, they are not doing the same work we are \ndoing.  We do have a statewide children's consortium where we all come together.  You are \nabsolutely right.  We want to make sure there are no silos and all of us are working off the \nsame sheet of music. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI just want to make sure there is not duplication of effort because we have such a limited \nsupply of funds and volunteers.  We need to make sure we are all working together and that it \nis a joint venture for all Nevadans. \n \nOn  the  Washoe  County  consortium's  presentation,  they  mentioned  toxic  stress.    In  my \nexperience, we are getting away from those terms and using something called ACEs—\nadverse childhood experiences.  Have we seen a resurgence of toxic stresses with the current \nCOVID-19 pandemic, or is that still something that has morphed into this more general term \nfor adverse childhood experiences? \n \nJacquelyn Kleinedler: \nThose two concepts are complementary.  When we are describing toxic stress in our ten-year \nplan and in our forward goals, what we are talking about is the stressors children face that are \nchronic, ongoing, and that require buffering, resiliency factors, or protective factors to be \nintroduced in order to prevent that toxic stress from creating long-term effects for that child. \n \nWhen we talk about adverse childhood experiences, we are referring specifically to the \nstandardized or the most normative ACE screening tool.  That has been used in research as \nthe correlative factor for ongoing problems for adults ranging from health to mental health to \nsubstance use to parenting issues. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nFor Committee members who may not know, the toxic stress rankings came out in around \n2010 and involve positive stresses, tolerable stresses, and toxic stresses.  Right now, I think  \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nI have a question regarding the limited number of beds we have for the children.  What \nhappens if the children have to be hospitalized?  Where do they go once we run out of those \nbeds? \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 15, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nMegan Freeman: \nOccasionally, they have to stay in the emergency room or a medical hospital, and sometimes \nthey do go out of state. \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nDo you have an estimate of how many children are being sent out of state, and by out of \nstate, are we talking about Arizona, California, or Utah, or are they going to Kansas or \nTexas? \n \nMegan Freeman: \nTypically, whoever places the youth tries to keep them as close to home as possible.  Many \nyouth do go to Utah and Arizona.  We have that data publicly available, and we can get that \nto you to make sure you have all the information in detail. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you for your presentations.  If any Committee members have any follow-up questions, \ncomments, or concerns, please follow up with our individual speakers.  With that, I will \nmove on to our next presentation—an overview of Medicaid. \n \nSuzanne  Bierman,  Administrator,  Division  of  Health  Care  Financing  and  Policy, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services:   \nThank you for the opportunity to present a very high-level overview of Nevada Medicaid and \nits relationship to the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services (DWSS).  Today, we will \nbe presenting an overview of Medicaid, how it works, the eligibility process, how it is \ndelivered, a description of some of the benefits and services that are provided, how the \nfederal and state programs work together, and how that works out for Nevadans, the state, \nhospitals, doctors, and others [page 2, Exhibit H]. \n \nMedicaid is the state's largest insurer and provides significant funding for hospitals, Federally \nQualified Health Centers, nursing homes, and many other health care providers.   \n \nRobert Thompson, Deputy Administrator, Division of Welfare and Supportive Services, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services: \nThis is a joint presentation because DWSS operates the application and eligibility side of \nNevada Medicaid for thousands of Nevadans a year [page 3].  Once a person is found \neligible, we transmit that data, and our partners at Nevada Medicaid take over. \n \nSuzanne Bierman: \nThe Division of Health Care Financing and Policy (DHCFP) is payor.  We currently are \nserving over 810,000 Nevadans, a significant increase from pre-COVID-19 days.  Medicaid \nis a health insurance program.  It provides coverage for low-income children and adults, \nseniors, and people with disabilities.  In challenging economic times, Medicaid provides \ntemporary help for people who lose their jobs or become too sick to work.  All Nevadans \nwho meet eligibility requirements are guaranteed coverage under Medicaid. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 15, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nNevada Medicaid functions in many ways like commercial insurance.  We enroll providers, \nprocess and pay claims, provide oversight of provider billing, and monitor utilization and \nmanagement, just to name a few activities.  The Division currently has a little over 300 \nemployees. \n \nThis is a slide we often use [page 4, Exhibit H].  We think it is important and provides a \nhigh-level overview of some of the impacts of the program for Nevadans.  As I mentioned, \nwe have seen such an increase in our enrollment that Nevada Medicaid now covers one in \nfour Nevadans.  When I did this presentation two years ago, that figure was one in five.   \n \nNevada Medicaid makes up a large percentage of the state budget at nearly 30 percent of \nstate expenditures.  We cover a lot.  Sixty percent of the births in the state are covered by \nMedicaid, and it is also the single largest payor of nursing home care and long-term services.  \nI want to note that Nevada Medicaid covers services that are not always covered by other \ncommercial insurance programs or even Medicare.  Back to the point about Nevada Medicaid \nbeing the primary payor for long-term care services, that is because many other commercial \ninsurance programs and, outside of a certain day limitation, Medicare, do not reimburse for \nthose services.  So this is just another way Medicaid serves as a safety net for the state. \n \nOur enrollment has definitely changed due to the public health emergency in the COVID-19 \npandemic.  I will spend some time on this slide, which is prepandemic, but it points out that \nNevada has a higher rate of uninsured than the average across the United States [page 5].  \nWhile we note that this has changed during the pandemic, I think it is important to note that, \nhistorically, Nevada has had a higher rate of uninsured compared to the rest of the nation. \n \nThis slide shows our current Medicaid caseload as of January 2021 and the trends over the \ncourse of the last year [page 6].  You can see that uptick due to the COVID-19 public health \nemergency, and you can see that we have continued to see increases in our enrollment, but \nnot at as such a steep rate as earlier in 2020. \n \nThese sorts of increases in the Medicaid program as the economy worsens are not surprising.  \nMedicaid is what is called a counter-cyclical program.   That means when the economy \nworsens, its caseload goes up.  We are certainly seeing that here, and it is an expected trend \nin Medicaid programs as states face tough economic times. \n \nA piece of federal legislation passed in early 2020 has some implications for our caseload, \nand that is the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA), which has brought some \nadditional federal funding to the state.  However, along with that has come maintenance of \neffort requirements for eligibility.  That requires continuous Medicaid eligibility during the \ntime of the public health emergency.  We expect to see these types of trends continue as the \neconomy worsens.  Another contributing factor to our increasing caseload is due to that \nrequirement of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.  Almost half of our recipients \nare parents and children, then adults, and about 20 percent are in other eligibility categories, \nincluding individuals with disabilities.   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 15, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nRobert Thompson: \nInformation on the next few slides shows how Nevadans access Medicaid.  They apply to \nMedicaid through processes within DWSS [page 7].  You might wonder why there are two \ndifferent state divisions that administer Medicaid.  It is common in other states to see one \nstate agency that handles both the eligibility determinations for the public, and that works for \nthe  payors;  however,  in  Nevada,  DWSS  does  more  than  just  determine  eligibility  for \nMedicaid.  Nevada is somewhat unique in our approach to administering Medicaid.  Often in \nstates where Medicaid is a single agency, there are other, separate agencies for social services \nthat serve similar populations.  In other states, a person in need would be required to travel to \none government office or agency to apply for food assistance such as Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program (SNAP) and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), \nwhich is welfare, and then travel to another agency to apply for Medicaid.  In the early \n1990s, Nevada integrated these systems to remove the administrative burden from the public \nand put the burden on the state to provide one streamlined process to access multiple benefits \nto persons or families who need it. \n \nIn Nevada, we have organized our access so that several other major social services programs \ncan be accessed at the same entry point.  These other programs include SNAP, TANF, \nour energy assistance program, and our child care development program.  In addition to \nadministering  these  programs,  the  Division  is  the  state-level  child  support  enforcement \nauthority,  and  we  have  provided  administrative  support  to  the  homeless  housing  board \ncommission.  This was done in an effort to create a one-stop shop for persons in need.  While \nmany people receiving Medicaid, SNAP, and TANF can and do work, for those who are not \nemployed, the Division administers workforce development programs to create pathways for \npeople  so  they  can  improve  their  potential  and  contribute  to  their  communities.    For \nindividuals on SNAP, the workforce program is called SNAP Employment and Training, or \nyou may hear us refer to it as SNAP E&T.  For individuals on TANF, the workforce \ndevelopment is called New Employees in Nevada, also referred to as NEON. \n \nYou might imagine that, with the additional programming features and the complexity of \nMedicaid's financial employment obligations, it became necessary to divide the duties for \nMedicaid and its two different divisions.  That change was made by the Nevada Legislature \nin the 1990s.  \n \nThere are two ways to apply for Medicaid [page 8].  The first way is through referrals, and \nthe majority of our referrals come from Nevada Health Link, also referred to as the health \nexchange.  Nevada Health Link reviews all marketplace applications because if anyone \napplying for coverage may be eligible for Medicaid or Nevada Check Up, depending on \nincome limits, and if an applicant appears to be eligible for Medicaid, the application is \nreferred  to  us  for  processing  with  no  additional  application  required  from  the  person \napplying.  These applicants then receive correspondence about their case from us.  The \nreason  there  is  no  additional  and  separate  application  required  is  because  the  Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) required a streamlined application process for \nMedicaid coverage.   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 15, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nAnother referral system is for hospitals to apply on behalf of a patient, and a hospital can get \nbenefits through what is known as hospital presumptive eligibility.  This method does require \npeople to follow through with an additional regular application if they want to maintain their \ncoverage.  There are additional quality control measures that the welfare division puts in \nplace to make sure those claims are being paid appropriately and are not fraudulent. \n \nCustomers can also apply directly with us.  We refer to this as click-in, call-in, mail-in, or \ncome-in.  We encourage all our customers to apply online through Access Nevada.  It is the \nmost efficient system for them and us.  But customers can also verbally apply over the phone \nto our call center.  A lot of people do not know that.  With Medicaid, we have an approved \nwaiver for the person to verbally apply and verbally sign the application over the phone.  \nThere may be additional paperwork to do, but that initial application can be done verbally. \n \nWe receive applications via mail or through our drop boxes, and the final method is in \nperson, which, obviously, was pre-COVID-19.  Either in our DWSS offices or as part of \ngrowing outreach initiatives, we have set up many access points that are nontraditional such \nas  in  homeless  shelters,  family  court,  community  centers,  and,  in  some  cases,  even  in \ndetention centers.  We plan to reactivate those, post-COVID-19. \n \nOnce DWSS has received the application for assistance, we have to evaluate the household \ncircumstances to determine if they are eligible [page 9, Exhibit H].  Medicaid is approved at \nno  cost,  while  Nevada  Check  Up  has  quarterly  premiums.    The  primary  eligibility \ndeterminations look at gross income, citizenship, household composition, residency, and, in \nsome cases depending on the program being applied for, we have to look at their resources \nand assets.  Those are primary eligibility reasons; there are multiple factors in eligibility.  \nThis slide also includes a snapshot of eligible income categories.  Taking a household of one \nfor example, if we were looking at a single adult without children, not pregnant, and not \ndisabled, if that person's income level fell within 138 percent of poverty, so as long as the \nindividual is making under $1,483 a month, that person would be eligible for Medicaid. \n \nA second example could be a single parent with two children—so a household of three.  \nBecause there are children in the home, we would look at 205 percent of poverty, so that \nfamily could have up to $3,752 of gross monthly income and remain eligible for Medicaid \nassistance and that 205 percent is for Nevada Check Up.  At this point, our agency would \napprove the case, transmit the data to Nevada Medicaid, and they would take over the case \nfrom there.  They would issue the Medicaid cards and would become the enroller and the \npayor.   \n \nSuzanne Bierman: \nAs was mentioned, once DWSS has approved an application for Medicaid, DHCFP begins \nthe Medicaid enrollment process.  Nevada Medicaid uses two different service delivery \nmodels—managed care and fee-for-service [page 10].  Managed care is the primary model, \ncovering 72 percent of the recipients in the state.  It is available in the urban counties of \nClark and Washoe, and to all eligibility groups except for the aged, blind, and disabled.  \nNevada Medicaid currently contracts with three managed care organizations (MCOs) to \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 15, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nprovide care under this model.  Individuals can choose among these three organizations as \npart of their eligibility application process, and the selected managed care organization will \nthen provide a welcome packet with information about insurance coverage to the Nevada \nMedicaid member.  In the instance that a recipient does not choose among the three MCOs, \nthere is a process for auto-assigning those members to one of the three MCO plans. \n \nFee-for-service is the other service delivery model that is used by Nevada Medicaid.  In this \nmodel,  DHCFP  performs  many  of  the  same  functions  and  activities  as  a  commercial \ninsurance plan would, such as provider enrollment and claims processing.  Fee-for-service \ncovers Nevadans in rural areas and the aged, blind, and disabled population.    \n \nOn this slide, we have an overview of some of the benefits and services provided by Nevada \nMedicaid [page 11].  This is not the full list and is just for illustrative purposes and to \ndescribe one element of the federal-state framework.  The program, of course, is jointly \nadministered  between  the  state  and  the  federal  government,  and  certain  services  are \nmandatory  and  must  be  provided  by  all  states.    Other  services  are  optional.    The \nmandatory/optional service set up in the Medicaid program accounts for one of the reasons \nyou see variation in Medicaid programs across states.  As I said, this is not a full list, but I \nwanted to note this mandatory/optional distinction.   \n \nNevada  Medicaid  does  provide  comprehensive  coverage  for  children.    The  benefit  for \nchildren is what we refer to as EPSDT, which is early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and \ntreatment services.  For the Medicaid expansion adults, Nevada Medicaid does cover the ten \nessential health benefits.  Those are the same benefits that the ACA required to be covered by \nNevada Health Link, so there is some continuity of coverage as individuals have changes in \ntheir income and may transition from Medicaid to exchange coverage or vice versa.  In \naddition to those benefits, Medicaid also provides coverage for some services and benefits \nthat other commercial insurers typically do not cover.  An example of that is nonemergency \nmedical transportation and long-term care.  There is also a link here to the Centers for \nMedicare  and  Medicaid  Services  (CMS)  website  for  the  full  listing  of  mandatory  and \noptional services. \n \nWe often get questions concerning why Medicaid had not paid for a particular service, so I \nwanted to go over the four high-level requirements for Medicaid reimbursement [page 12].  \nWhen  Medicaid  pays  for  services  for  Medicaid-eligible  and  enrolled  individuals,  only \nproviders who are enrolled in Medicaid will be reimbursed.  Also, it must be a Medicaid-\ncovered service, which goes back to that optional list.  Is this a service that is included in \nMedicaid's benefit package?  Last, is the service medically necessary?   \n \nI want to talk about the program's overall authority and how it is jointly administered \nbetween the federal and state governments [page 13, Exhibit H].  The federal agency with \nwhom we work closely to administer this program is CMS.  To qualify for federal matching \nfunds, states must operate their Medicaid program in accordance with federal law and must \nfile a state plan and state plan amendment with CMS.  The state plan is basically the contract \nbetween the state and the federal government that describes how the state administers its \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 15, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nMedicaid  program.    It  outlines  the  state  rules  and  operating  protocols  for  program \nadministration.  It is the primary authority that governs Medicaid services.  However, waivers \nare also available to states when they need additional flexibility beyond what is available in \nstate plan authority to design their programs. \n \nAs an example, Nevada has three program waivers which are 1915(c) home- and community-\nbased  waivers  that  allow  Nevada  to  offer  home-  and  community-based  services  as  an \nalternative to care in facilities.  These waivers allow the state to impose limits on program \nenrollment that are otherwise not allowable under state plan authority.  Those are jointly \noperated by the Aging and Disability Services Division with oversight responsibility by \nDHCFP. \n \nIn addition to program waivers there are also options for research and demonstration waivers, \noften referred to as Section 1115 waivers.  These waivers allow states to test program \nfeatures that are otherwise not provided for or allowed under federal Medicaid law.  These \nSection  1115  research  and  demonstration  waivers  must  advance  the  objectives  of  the \nMedicaid program and are subject to stringent budget neutrality requirements that require \nactuarial analysis.  They are generally approved for five years.  If you think of this as a \ncontinuum between the standard and something that would be more of an exception to the \ngeneral rule, you have state plan and then program waivers, and then there are Section 1115 \nresearch  and  demonstration  waivers  when  the  state  needs  to  work  with  the  federal \ngovernment to try to design a program to meet state needs in a new and innovative way.   \n \nHere is a little information about how the program is jointly administered [page 14].  The \nfederal government pays for the majority of the cost of the Medicaid program in Nevada.  \nMedicaid is typically the single largest source of federal aid to the states.  The federal \ngovernment matches state Medicaid spending on an open-ended basis.  The diagram here \ndemonstrates how this works with the fee-for-service model where the federal government \nand the state pay providers.  In the managed care model, the funding comes from the state \nand federal government to the MCOs, and those organizations then pay the providers. \n \nThis slide shows something you will hear a lot about—FMAP, which is the federal medical \nassistance percentage [page 15].  This is additional information on the percentage of the \noverall Medicaid program that is paid for with federal funds.  Across all the Division's \nservices, the federal government is paying anywhere from 64 percent up to 92 percent of the \ncosts.  You can also see on this chart that two of the rows in this table show \"with FFCRA.\"  \nThat is the federal legislation I mentioned earlier when talking about enrollment that has \nsome implications related to maintenance of effort, requirements for eligibility, along with \nthe enhanced funding you can see on the slide.  I will also note that this enhanced funding \nunder the Families First Coronavirus Response Act is tied to the time frame of the public \nhealth emergency, so Nevada Medicaid is getting enhanced federal funding throughout the \npublic health emergency.  It has to be updated quarterly whether or not the public health \nemergency will continue to be extended.  The Biden Administration recently sent a letter to \ngovernors stating that it understood the need for predictability around the timing of the public \nhealth emergency and indicating its intention of continuing the public health emergency at \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 15, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nleast through calendar year 2021.  It also indicated that it would provide states with 60 days \nadvance notice before termination of the public health emergency. \n \nIn summary, I want to note again that during this time of a global health pandemic, Nevadans \nare increasingly relying on Medicaid.  It is the state's health insurance program for low-\nincome Nevadans, and it is a safety net during tough economic times.  Medicaid provides \ncomprehensive coverage and financial protection for many Nevadans.  We do this through \npartnership with the federal government and providers, and there are a number of additional \nresources on our website as listed on this slide [page 17].    \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there questions? \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nGoing back to where you list the federal poverty levels for the Medicaid program [page 9, \nExhibit H], are those poverty levels across all states?  How do they compare to other states? \n \nRobert Thompson: \nThose poverty levels are provided by the federal government to all states and are based on \nfederal poverty guidelines. \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nHow are those amounts determined when someone is applying for eligibility? \n \nRobert Thompson: \nIt depends on the program.  For most programs, we take the current circumstances and \nproject the future circumstances and determine what their income will be on a month-to-\nmonth basis.  If a person was working this month, their income was stable, everything was \nnormal, and they were making under a certain amount, we would approve them.  If they go \nover this amount this month, but they have verification with them showing that their income \nhas stopped, that they have recently lost a job, then we would project that the income had \nstopped.  We are consistently looking at what the current circumstances are and what the \nfuture projected circumstances are.  That is not true in some of the medical assistance rates or \nthe aged, blind, or disabled programs.  Some of those programs use actual income on a \nretroactive basis. \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nHow often do you redetermine someone's eligibility? \n \nRobert Thompson: \nPre-COVID-19, we determined eligibility annually for all our programs.  Customers are \nrequired to report to us if there is a change in circumstances.  If their income is to go up, they \nare required to report that, but we do touch base and do a full analysis at least once a year. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 15, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nAssemblyman Matthews: \nFor a few months we have been trending up.  Most economic indicators are starting to move \nin the right direction, and we are seeing state unemployment rates go down consistently \nmonth after month.  Are there any internal projections about when and where those caseload \nnumbers may finally peak?  When may we see some movement in the other direction as \nthings start to stabilize further in our economy? \n \nSuzanne Bierman: \nIt is difficult to predict, and we do work closely with DHCFP's office of analytics.  They \nwork on predicting and projecting caseloads for the department.  We have met with them \nrecently to take into account the recent news from the Biden Administration that they do plan \nto continue extending the public health emergency throughout the course of this calendar \nyear.  For that reason, we think that we will continue to see pretty high caseloads through \n2021.  Certainly, all of the maintenance of effort for eligibility protections that come along \nwith the FFCRA will be in place through that time period.  So, we plan to see our current \nlevels stay about where they are—the same steady increase, but not back to early 2020 rates.  \nHowever, we do not anticipate seeing any dramatic decreases at least through the period of \nthe public health emergency. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nYou continue to show increases in Medicaid applicants and potential recipients [page 6, \nExhibit H].  My question is, where is the slide that shows that you have an increase in \nMedicaid providers? \n \nCody Phinney, Deputy Administrator, Division of Health Care Financing and Policy, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services: \nWe have done some research on that for our provider enrollment unit.  We are seeing some \nincrease in providers and would be happy to send that data over to you.  It was actually more \nencouraging than I expected it to be.  As you know, people are losing their employment and \ntherefore their health insurance, but we were not expecting that more providers would be \ncoming here.  I can only attribute it to the fact that there are more people whose costs are \nreimbursable by our program; therefore, perhaps, providers are interested in participating \nmore fully.   \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI am sure the Chair and the whole Committee would like to see that too.  I have frequently \nreferred the increase in Medicaid applicants to \"giving out more bus passes but no more \nbuses,\" so it is great to hear that there may be a shift in the positive direction.  I am also \ninterested in access to care and how long are people waiting to get an appointment with a \nprovider, so if you could send the Committee that data, we would like that too because it is \nall relevant. \n \nPresumptive eligibility was mentioned and all the criteria for that [page 8].  I think I heard \nyou say that citizenship was a criteria, even including presumptive eligibility? \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 15, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nRobert Thompson: \nWhen I was listing the eligibility criteria, I was meaning the five main criteria that can \nimpact eligibility.  There are two dozen Medicaid programs we trickle down through, and \ncitizenship impacts coverage type as we move through those.  I did not mean to imply that \ncitizenship would turn on or turn off full eligibility, but it is one of those things we evaluate, \nand it does impact the type of cases that we can approve. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nOne of my biggest concerns, and I think others share this concern, are disparities in health \ncare and especially sometimes in the prenatal realm and pregnancy issues.  When you \nmentioned that they could sign up over the phone, I am concerned about that access and \nwanting  to  make  sure  that  that  application  process  is  bilingual.    Do  they  have  other \ninterpreters?  I want to make sure it is available to all the folks who truly need it and are \neligible. \n \nRobert Thompson: \nPreviously, we utilized case managers who were bilingual, and what we found was that we \ncould not keep the call-wait times equal if we had too many callers who spoke Spanish and \nnot enough agents that day.  We have a very efficient internal translation team that can \nconnect our case manager with the translation team that speaks Spanish at any time with no \nwait, so the waits are the same.  We also have a contract with an outside agency that will \nconnect with just about any language.  Sometimes that has to be scheduled ahead of time. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nExcellent.  That is critical; thank you for making that happen.  That is very encouraging. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWhen you are looking at the eligibility rates and income, how often do participants have to \nhave that eligibility reassessed? \n \nRobert Thompson: \nWhen we approve a person for Medicaid, we notify them that if their income increases above \na particular amount—and we give them the amount—they are required to notify us by the \nfifth of the following month of that change so we can reevaluate the case.  Whether we hear \nfrom a customer or not, we are required to do a full, new, reconfirming application annually \nto verify all income and nonincome criteria to make sure the household still meets eligibility.  \nSo, at least once a year. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI have another question that comes from a constituent who is a provider.  I have been \nwatching him go through the process of applying to be approved by Medicaid as a provider.  \nHow long does that process usually take? \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 15, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nCody Phinney: \nThe process to become a provider for Medicaid in Nevada is a little bit complex because of \nour two different delivery models.  The mechanism Nevada uses to meet the regulations that \nrequire the state to monitor our providers is we have everyone enrolled in our Nevada \nMedicaid Program—so every provider who wants to be reimbursed for any services through \nour regular program, which is our fee-for-service enrollment.  If the provider also wants to \nparticipate with our MCOs, then those MCOs do an additional credentialling process.  Some \nstates do that in a centralized way where it is one process.  In Nevada, we have them \nseparated.   \n \nThe enrollment into our fee-for-service program is within five days once we get all the \ninformation that is needed by our contractor who does that.  The managed care applications \ncan take a little bit longer because those are a more in-depth credentialling process to make \nsure that standards beyond our fee-for-service program are also met.  The whole process can \ntake some significant time.  Generally, it is within 90 days, but there are times when it takes \nlonger than that. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI want to thank you all for presenting today.  With that, I will close today's presentation and \nopen the hearing on Assembly Bill 26. \n \nAssembly  Bill  26:    Revises  provisions  governing  programs  of  energy  assistance. \n(BDR 58-298) \n \nRobert Thompson, Deputy Administrator, Division of Welfare and Supportive Services, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services: \nThank you for allowing us to present Assembly Bill 26 which is housekeeping language that \nrevises provisions governing programs of energy assistance.  The energy assistance program \nprovides a supplement to assist qualifying, low-income Nevadans for the costs of home \nenergy.  Nevada's energy assistance program has two funding sources, the Low Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program federal block grants and state revenue generated from \nNevada's Universal Energy Charge (UEC).  You may have seen a small tax added to your \npower bill.  That tax comes to us to roll out for energy assistance.  The energy assistance \nprogram year begins July 1, and applications are accepted through June 30.  Applications are \nevaluated year-round, or until funding is exhausted. \n \nEligible households receive an annual one-time benefit customarily paid directly to their \nenergy providers.  Currently, Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 702.275 is vague regarding the \nUEC, specified reporting dates of funds received, allocations, and distributions.  This vague \nwording has caused conflicts and confusion, as these reports are utilized to distribute any \nremaining UEC funds.  These proposed changes were recommended by the Legislative \nCounsel Bureau to clarify and specify the dates listed in the NRS to ensure that UEC funds \nare  distributed  as  intended  in  regulation  and  to  remove  any  room  for  interpretation  of \nprevious language.  \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 15, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo Committee members have any questions?

Committee rules and protocol were explained.] \n \nToday, we have a presentation from the Patient Protection Commission and a hearing on \nAssembly Bill 16.  Most of the bills that came out of the Patient Protection Commission \noriginated  in  the  Senate.    If  all  goes  well  in  the  Senate,  we  will  hear  those  bills  in \nthis Committee.  Many people have inquired about the Patient Protection Commission, so \nI welcome our first presenter.   \n \nSara Cholhagian, Executive Director, Patient Protection Commission, Office of the \nGovernor: \nI thank Chair Nguyen for allowing me to come to give you an overview of the Commission, \nto highlight some of our responsibilities, to share some of the work the Commission has \ndone, and to touch upon some of the proposed legislation the Chair mentioned. \n \nThe Patient Protection Commission (PPC) was created through passage of Senate Bill 544 of \nthe 80th Session [page 2, Exhibit C].  It was sponsored by Governor Steve Sisolak and \nreceived bipartisan support, passing unanimously in both houses.  We are in the Office of the \nGovernor.    We  are  dedicated  to  improving  health  care  in  Nevada  through  systematic, \ncomprehensive  review  of  the  state's  health  care  system  and  challenges  and  initiatives \nsurrounding the quality, accessibility and affordability of health care in our state.  The \nCommission is also charged with making informed recommendations to the Legislature and \nthe Governor to improve health care for all patients. \n \nI will share the mission, vision, and values of the Commission through the lens of our \nGovernor  [page  3].    Governor  Sisolak  saw  this  as  a  way  to  provide  a  forum  for  all \nstakeholders to come to the table and to work together on the critical task of improving health \ncare access and affordability for every patient in Nevada.   \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 17, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nOur team is composed of me, the executive director; Lezlie Mayville, the administrative \nassistant and policy coordinator; and the policy analyst, a vacant staff position I hope to fill \nlater this year [page 4].  I would be remiss if I did not thank the other state agencies that were \nmonumental in helping get the Commission up and running relatively quickly last year.  \nI would not have been able to do this quickly enough to host our first meeting had it not been \nfor the assistance of Barbara Richardson, Commissioner of Insurance, Division of Insurance, \nDepartment of Business and Industry; Heather Korbulic, Executive Director, Silver State \nHealth  Insurance  Exchange;  and  Richard  Whitley,  Director,  Department  of  Health  and \nHuman Services, who provided dedicated staff and additional resources to help facilitate this.   \n \nThe Commission is composed of 11 members who were appointed by the Governor [page 5].  \nThey represent experience across the health care spectrum.  Our chair is Dr. Ikram Khan.  \nMembers serve in a voting capacity.  We have three nonvoting members—Director Richard \nWhitley, Insurance Commissioner Barbara Richardson, and Heather Korbulic, Executive \nDirector, Silver State Health Insurance Exchange.   \n \nI  will  now  highlight  some  of  the  Commission's  activities  of  the  past  year  [page  6].  \nThe Commission  held  its  first  meeting  on  February  3,  2020,  and  met  once  more \non March 2, before Governor Sisolak made his Declaration of Emergency for COVID-19 for \nthe state to address, contain, and mitigate the effects of COVID-19.  Several meetings were \npostponed as the Commission followed his directives and guidelines for hosting public \nmeetings.  On May 19, he requested the Commission to prioritize its work to best serve \nNevada  in  this  time  of  state  and  national  emergency,  asking  for  assistance  with \nrecommendations  concerning  long-term  recovery  for  our  state.    On  June  9,  2020, \nthe Commission  held  its  first  virtual  meeting  and  agreed  to  refocus  the  Commission's \npriorities.  In that meeting, the Commission also decided to meet  every other Monday \nthrough August 31, due to the September 1 deadline for submitting bill draft requests to the \nLegislature.   \n \nOn June 22, the Commission met to start identifying issues that negatively impact the quality, \naccessibility, or affordability of health care under the Commission's new focus.  It held \nfour more meetings before it acted on the recommendations for bill drafts.  During those \nmeetings, topics discussed included transparency measures, sustaining available health care \noptions,  addressing  affordability  for  vulnerable  populations,  improving  public  health \ncoordination  efforts,  improving  data  collection  and  analysis  for  evidence-based  policy \nmaking and planning, workforce development, and telehealth—which is part of one of the \nCommission's bill draft requests.  \n \nOn August 31, the Commission voted to request two pieces of legislation to address access \nand affordability of health care.  I will touch upon that in our next slide.  Following the \nCommission's work that led up to August, we decided to pause, reflect, and solicit the \nCommission's feedback on its remaining work for the rest of the year.  We received feedback \non topics of recommendations, requests for meetings, and developed a priority list of topics  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 17, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nfor the Commission to rank.  On November 9, the Commission discussed the summary of the \npriority indication worksheet.  Through that exercise, the Commission identified four priority \ntopic areas which remain the current focus of the Commission for its ongoing work plan.   \n \nThe current priorities, in no particular order, are a continued review and examination of the \ncost of health care and the primary factors impacting those costs; a review of health care \nworkforce issues in Nevada and recommendations to improve access and delivery of health \ncare; a review of the effects of changes to Medicaid, including the cost and availability of \nhealth care and health insurance in the state; and a review of the role of the PPC in improving  \ncoordination and collaboration efforts.  I am proud of the work the Commission has done so \nfar, especially given the inability to meet in person.  We were able to host 11 public meetings \nin the middle of a pandemic.  Prior to the pandemic, I did not know how to use Zoom, let \nalone how to use it in compliance with Nevada Open Meeting Law.  I remain optimistic \nabout the work we are doing for the betterment of Nevada patients.  I continue to look to \nmember  engagement  and  continued  discussion  of  their  priorities.    Our  next  meeting  is \nscheduled for March 15.   \n \nI will touch on our proposed legislation [page 7].  As Chair Nguyen indicated, both of the \npatient protection bills will first be heard in the Senate.  I hope to be speaking to this \nCommittee relatively soon to have a deeper discussion on the proposed legislation.   \n \nSenate Bill 5 is a measure that relates to increasing access for telehealth services and also \nfocuses on equitable access.  Senate Bill 40 is a transparency measure aimed at enhancing \npatients' health experiences and improving outcomes by implementing measures that help \nunderstand data trends.  I will now answer any questions members may have about the \nCommission. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nMy question is about the scope of effort related to the variety of insurance offered in the \nstate.  At the state level, we have Medicaid and the Public Employees Benefits Program, and \nthere  are  group  policies  and  others.    Would  you  describe  how  the  Patient  Protection \nCommission reviews those?  Does it compare them?  Is there a process in place to do that?  \n \nSara Cholhagian: \nThere is no established procedure for having that discussion take place in front of the \nCommission.  There have been some limited discussions about the topic of various insurance \noptions.  One commissioner attempted a deeper discussion about public options and health \ncare reform that was included in a range of options for the Commission to consider as a top \npriority.  Our agendas are built around presentations or deliberations from Commission \nmembers focusing on the four priority areas.  That topic fits under our second priority, the \nCommission's desire to review the effects of changes to Medicaid, including the cost and \navailability  of  health  care  and  health  insurance  in  the  state.    I  solicit  feedback  from  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 17, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \ncommissioners to recommend presentations or provide information that I can share for their \ndeliberation at our meetings.  I foresee discussing that at the Commission but only at the \nrequest of Commission members as an agenda item.   \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nI appreciate the context.  We have quite a scene of insurance to grapple with and a variety of \nalternatives people can access.  Long-term, I would love to see the Commission dive into \nwhat equity looks like in the variety of insurance plans and how much of what the state is \nresponsible for helps to balance or increase equity so all people have access to the coverage \nthey need.   \n \nI  have  a  family  of  five  on  a  single  income.    My  husband  is  a  veteran  with  Veterans \nAdministration benefits.  We are in a unique position, but it is not the same as a single person \nwho works for the state or for one of our school districts, for example, or for a retiree who \ndoes not meet the Medicare threshold.  I look forward to your future work in that area.  \n \nSara Cholhagian: \nI agree with you.  I do not think your experience is unique to the patients in Nevada.  The \nCommission would like to hear from you about how you think we could look into that.  \nIf you agree, I could set up a meeting with you to see if we can take a deeper dive into that on \na future agenda.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any questions from other Committee members?  [There were none.]  I have one.  \nSenate Bill 5 focuses on telehealth.  Would you talk about discussions that went into that?  \nOur rural members are familiar with it, as we have had some provisions in place that allow \nfor better access.   \n \nSara Cholhagian: \nThe Commission's intent for the proposal was aimed at increasing access to telehealth for all \npatients.  In looking at long-term recovery from COVID-19, we have seen patients using \ntelehealth to access service.  Several federal waivers were granted through the Public Health \nEmergency Declaration.  The Commission wanted to codify some of the waivers into Nevada \nlaw to allow for the expanded service to continue.  In addition, the Commission discussed \nequitable access and vulnerable populations, but recognized we need to be mindful of the \nstate's budget and economic recovery.  Even though there were discussions about increased \nbroadband access that could help facilitate greater access for vulnerable populations in rural \nareas, we needed to look at policies without a huge fiscal impact.  With inequitable access, \none provision in the Commission's measure related to creating a data dashboard highlighting \ndifferent telehealth access and making sure it was posted somewhere so consumers were \naware.  We have data to start discussions about informed policy decisions for the future.   \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 17, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nRecognizing we needed to start somewhere, but absent data, the Commission wanted to \nutilize what the state already has.  There are provisions that tie the data dashboard to the \nreview of the Commission and require the data be reviewed by our Regional Behavioral \nHealth Policy Boards.  The intent was to foster collaboration but recognized discussions \nabout vulnerable populations and health equity need to be at the forefront when you are \ntalking about future policy recommendations.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there other questions from members?  [There were none.]  I am sure we will see more of \nyou in the future as these bills come to the Assembly.  I would encourage Committee \nmembers to review the PPC meetings online.  They met often during the health pandemic.  \nI appreciate the fact they were able to hold 11 meetings during that time.   \n \nI will now open the hearing on Assembly Bill 16.   \n \nAssembly Bill 16:  Revises provisions related to the issuance of copies of certificates and \nrecords of birth. (BDR 40-329) \n \nCharles Daniels, Director, Department of Corrections: \nWe are presenting Assembly Bill 16.  What is A.B. 16, and why is it needed?  The Nevada \nDepartment of Corrections (NDOC) is requesting the ability to process birth certificates prior \nto the 90-day post release time.  Assembly Bill 16 incurs no cost to the state.  Implementation \ndoes not increase or reduce the overall number of requests.  And, although the processing \ntimeline is extended prior to the immediate 90 days post release, the extension will not have \nany impact on our stakeholders.  To discuss this further, I will turn this over to Deputy \nDirector Harold Wickham in our northern office.  \n \nHarold Wickham, Deputy Director, Operations, Department of Corrections: \nWe collaborated with the Office of Vital Records.  In accordance with Nevada Revised \nStatutes (NRS) 440.175, section 3:  \"A person or governmental organization which issues \ncertified or official copies pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection 2 shall:  (a) Not charge \na fee for issuing a certified or official copy of a certificate of birth to . . . (2) A person who \nsubmits documentation from the Department of Corrections verifying that the person was \nreleased from prison within the immediately preceding 90 days.\"  This limits our ability to \nprovide offenders the necessary documents upon release, allowing them to be productive \ncitizens in our communities.  Sometimes, offenders receive merit credits for school courses \nor vocational training they take, or they have an early release, so our time is made even \nshorter.  We need to find a way to provide these documents sooner.  We would like to \nprovide them upon intake.  When offenders come in, we can do the needs assessment and get \nthe documents started.  Even within our facilities, offenders must have these documents to \nwork for our prison industry. \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 17, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nWhy do we need the change?  It basically provides a better continuum of care for the \noffenders when they leave us.  Formerly incarcerated persons, just like any citizen in our \ncommunity, need two forms of ID to attain housing, health care, education, employment, \nvocational training, or a driver's license.  Unfortunately, if they do not have these documents \nwithin the first few days after being released, it causes problems as offenders cannot get the \nservices  and  support  they  need.    This  is  when  they  tend  to  revert  to  old  models  and \nmentalities and ultimately return to our facilities.  Our job is to help reduce recidivism, \nreduce victimization in the community, and provide a better continuum of care for Nevadans.   \n \nI received communication from the Washoe County Public Defender's Office.  They asked \nme to tell you that they are in support as they were unable to testify today due to a conflict in \ntheir schedule.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any questions? \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nThank you for your explanation of this bill.  Will you go acquire inmate information and \nreach out to vital statistics to get the document for them, or are you recreating something?  \nWould you explain the process? \n \nHarold Wickham: \nWe do not anticipate changing the process; we want to move it up so we can get the \ndocuments from vital records earlier.  That way, they are in the offenders' hands upon \nrelease.  \n \nElizabeth  Dixon-Coleman,  Statewide  Re-entry  Administrator,  Department  of \nCorrections: \nWe obtain birth certificates for inmates who are incarcerated by using the state system for \nrecords of birth.  We print out the application for Nevada, a state, or a county, depending on \nwhat they need.  We send them to the vital records departments.  If we begin the process at \nintake, which we have done over the past year, we get the birth certificates back in a timely \nfashion.    We  have  found  that  most  states  return  those  birth  certificates  quickly,  while \nNevada's vital records department has had us wait for the post release. Though we have \ncollaborated closely with our state agencies, we do a lot of calling back and forth when the \nrelease dates change or if inmates are involved in programming.  We are not recreating \na process; we are using a federal statute process for retrieving birth certificate documentation.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nSeveral members have asked what \"post release\" is. \n \nElizabeth Dixon-Coleman: \n\"Post release\" is the time after an offender has left the Department of Corrections facility.  \nThe way it is put in NRS, there is an option for us to get the birth certificate to a released \ninmate up to 90 days after they are released to home, the street, Division of Parole and \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 17, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nProbation, Nevada Department of Public Safety, or however they are released back into our \ncommunities.  At the Department of Corrections, we have found this needs to be done \npre-release.  As Deputy Director Wickham stated, inmates can obtain jobs inside.  They need \nto complete an Employment Eligibility Verification Form I-9 and other paperwork in order to \nbe hired for that.  They need a birth certificate component for that.  We have also found that \nwhen  offenders  reenter  our  communities,  the  more  documentation  they  have  in  their \npossession to gain services or anything that will reconnect them to the community, the better \nit is to have it when they walk out of the gate and not give up to 90 days after release.  We \nhave found if they do not have housing, wraparound services for obtaining a job, and \ncontinuum of care services, they will go back to reoffending within 48 hours.  This agrees \nwith federal statistics. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI would like to circle back to the bill itself.  Under section 1, subsection 3, paragraph (a), \nsubparagraph (2), this bill adds the words, \"is imprisoned or.\"  Currently, the statute says we \ndo not charge a fee for somebody who was just released on parole or someone who is \nhomeless.  Is that correct? \n \nElizabeth Dixon-Coleman: \nYou are correct.  In reviewing NRS 440.175, under subsection 3, the change in wording is \ntaking away the word \"post release.\"  It incurs no extra fee now. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThis only stops Nevada from charging a fee; it does not stop another state from charging \na fee for documents.  If another state charges a fee, who pays it?   \n \nElizabeth Dixon-Coleman: \nCorrect.  This is only updating NRS to say the timeline has changed.  Nevada currently does \nnot charge a fee for incarcerated people who want a copy of their birth certificate.  As the \nlaw stands today, prior to that 90-day post release, our inmates have the option of paying \nor having family members pay for that ahead of time.  Some inmates have chosen to do that.  \nIt does not prevent other states from charging for the documents. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nNothing currently stops an inmate or family member from applying at any time, but many \nmay not be able to afford to do so.  Having ID is critical.  I am supportive of this.  It does not \nprevent an inmate or a family member with permission to apply for the document at any \ntime. \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 17, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nElizabeth Dixon-Coleman: \nThat is correct.  They can apply at any time and pay for the birth certificate.  It does not \nprevent them from that action. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nYou talked about IDs.  It is critical for them to have ID when they get out if they need to \napply for a job or a home.  I wonder about Medicaid enrollment and health insurance.  Does \nthis have an implication on access to care? \n \nElizabeth Dixon-Coleman: \nYes, it does.  The more ID they have, whether a birth certificate or a social security card, \nwhen they apply for Medicaid, health services, or housing, the better it is for the continuum \nof care for those wraparound services.  It is NDOC's mission, and has been over the past \nthree years, to connect returning citizens with those documents so there is no delay or break \nin care.  We use those documents in applying for Medicaid services to make sure those \nservices are connected for each of the reentering citizens.  We want to see those benefits \nreconstituted before release so they can be initiated immediately upon release with no break \nin service. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI appreciate the Department of Corrections acting as advocates for those who are incarcerated \nfrom Day One of their incarceration because you need to anticipate their release from the \nmoment they are incarcerated.  How are you going to help these folks moving forward?  \nThank you for all you are doing. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nI  would  like  some  clarification.    What  happens  if  someone  from  Minnesota  who  is \nincarcerated and does not have family or money on the books is coming close to the 90 days \nand needs these vital statistics documents?  What do you do if they do not have resources? \n \nElizabeth Dixon-Coleman: \nThe applications are processed.  Should they earn funds that are put onto their incarceration \nfunding sources, on their books, they would be charged for the documents upon release.  But \neach person who is incarcerated is provided with that documentation. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nIs there a sum of money given at release that this can be charged back to so the person can \nleave with the needed documents?  If so, does that leave the person in a vulnerable position \nwhen leaving if the documents cost a certain amount of money and it is deducted from the \nfunds that they receive walking out the door? \n \nElizabeth Dixon-Coleman: \nYes, it would be deducted from the funds they receive upon release.  Depending on the fee \ncharged by the state, fees for birth certificates range from $15 to $43.  It could incur a deficit \nor a burden upon the reentering citizen. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 17, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nThe reason I am asking this is because I am in Assembly District No. 6.  I have worked with \nand had numerous conversations with those who are helping the homeless in my district.  The \nLas Vegas Rescue Mission and many of the services for the homeless are in Assembly \nDistrict No. 6.  What ends up happening is the municipality ends up incurring the cost of \nhelping people who cannot afford to have this deducted from their bank when you release \nthem.  Has there been any discussion with the municipalities about this issue?  Is there a way \nto set up a reserve so we are not releasing people without documents who have asked for \nthem, or deducting the fees from the small amount of money they receive when they leave \nincarceration?    This  is  of  real  concern.    We  do  not  want  to  see  recidivism  in  our \ncommunities.  We do not want people not asking for these documents because they know \nthey are only going to have $150 when they come out, and they need to have a room for the \nnight or get some food.  We also do not want to leave local municipalities with the strain of \nholding the bag to make sure people are not homeless on our streets.  In Las Vegas, people \ncannot sleep on the streets.  It creates a cycle if there is not a holistic approach, including \ncommunication with the municipalities to come up with a solution. \n \nChris Franklin, Administrator, Grants and Policy, Department of Corrections: \nRight now, we have not reached out to municipalities individually.  As you may know, \nthe Nevada Department of Corrections participates with many of our stakeholders in the \ncommunity through our Re-Entry Task Force.  They are the first to admit that identification \nis their biggest problem in being able to provide services to those in need.  As previously \nstated, this process starts at intake for us.  Most offenders coming in from the county do not \nhave money in their inmate accounts.  The Inmate Welfare Account fronts that money to \nthem so they can get their birth certificate, and it is in their files for later use and upon \nrelease.  If upon release they do not have funds, the dollar amount we have been holding is \nwritten off.  We are doing everything within our power to try to provide them with the \nidentification or birth certificate they need.  There may be a family member who wants to get \nthe documents to them sooner, or there may be  a cost  involved with getting the birth \ncertificate.  Sometimes, the cost is transferred to the one who needs the documentation. \n \nElizabeth Dixon-Coleman: \nWe have a continuum of care with many of our managed care organizations (MCOs) and \ncommunity partners.  Should subsidies be needed for obtaining documentation, wraparound \nservices,  or  housing,  we  try  to  connect  those  being  released  to  the  MCOs  and  other \nstate-supported community partners that can assist with the deficit.  So, if someone comes \nout with less money for housing, we try to connect him with those agencies.  If there is a fee \nor  they  need  to  connect  with  medical  resources,  we  work  with  our  managed  care \norganizations to help ensure no one is left without those resources.   \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nNot everyone who is incarcerated has family with extra resources to put money on people's \nbooks.  If fees are taken out of an inmate's bank during incarceration and the inmate is left \nwith very little, are we setting up that person to fail?  I am concerned about this because  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 17, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nit directly impacts my community.  There is 15 percent unemployment in a large swath of \nAssembly District No. 6.  The highest homeless population in Clark County is centered in my \ndistrict.  We need solutions to help people succeed, not to set them up for failure.  It is hard \nto believe that it is a financial burden for us to make sure that, at the very least, we give \npeople IDs so they can get these services as they are leaving.  If people have a hard time \npaying for bail, where will they get money to put on people's books?  I think it is connected \nfinancially, and I think we must be cognizant of this so we do not set people up for failure.  \nI do not want to see recidivism because people are desperate.  Desperation is what makes \npeople do desperate things.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI appreciate your clarification that when people do not have the funds to pay for this, their \nfees are written off.  I know we have a problem that people who have been granted parole are \nunable  to  obtain  services—housing  or  other  wraparound  services—so  they  are  still \nincarcerated.  Do you anticipate getting their identification earlier on will help alleviate some \nof that? \n \nElizabeth Dixon-Coleman: \nAs they are exiting, we collaborate with Parole and Probation and other state agencies, so this \nis not a preventative measure.  Having documentation ahead of time will enable those who \nare released to obtain needed wraparound services.  It would give them time when they are \nparoled or exiting prison without family supports, if they have those documents ahead of \ntime, they can get the services they need.  It would not be a preventative act to not release \nthem because they do not have a birth certificate. \n \nHarold Wickham: \nI think Ms. Dixon-Coleman covered it well.  The Inmate Welfare Account also provides for \nbirth certificates as needed.  At NDOC, our mission has changed dramatically.  Our goal is to \nrelease offenders as productive citizens.  We are going to do everything we can, and we want \nto do it as soon as we can, to get offenders the identification, the necessary documents, \ntraining, and vocational skills to return to the communities successful.  Our ultimate goal is \nto protect the community. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there further questions?  [There were none.]  At this time, I will hear testimony in \nsupport, opposition, and neutral on A.B. 16.  Mr. Wickham indicated the Washoe County \nPublic Defender's Office was in support.  Is there testimony in support of A.B. 16? \n \nJodi Hocking, Private Citizen, Carson City, Nevada: \nI am both part of an impacted family—my loved one is incarcerated at Southern Desert \nCorrectional Center—and I am the founder of Return Strong:  Families United for Justice for \nthe Incarcerated.  I appreciate your time today.   \n \nI want to share on a personal level my support for A.B. 16 and providing birth certificates \nfor incarcerated  people  prior  to  their  release  from  prison.    My  partner  was  released  in \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 17, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nOctober 2018, after 19 years of incarceration.  He got a voucher to waive the fees for his \nbirth certificate, which was a help, but it disregarded many of the barriers to transitioning \ninto society.  Prior to incarceration, he did not live a life that necessarily followed the rules \nthat many of us follow, so he never had a copy of his birth certificate or social security card; \nhe never had a driver's license.  But, when he was released, he had all the best intentions to \nlive what he called a \"square life\"—family and home, working, staying out of the way and \nout of trouble—a life that followed the rules.  Unfortunately, every corner we turned created \nmore problems.  It took us four months to actually get his birth certificate because the ID that \nwas given to him by the prison was under the alias he used when he was arrested.  It was not \nhis true name, so getting a birth certificate became a barrier to identification, which created \na dilemma in finding work and getting health insurance to deal with his post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, in attending school.  He was accepted into a union apprenticeship program, but he \ncould not provide the correct identification because he did not have a birth certificate.  The \ncrazy thing is he spent a year asking his caseworker to help him address the problem without \nbeing able to get that resolved before he was released. \n \nHonestly, the frustration and anger created a cycle of depression and hopelessness.  It is hard \nto describe how deeply it impacted him, so deeply that we started to see him slip away.  He \nwould always say that he was lost, but it was devastating to him to want so desperately to do \nthe right thing by all of us and not be able to do it through no fault of his own.  Now, as \nMr. Wickham and Director Daniels have said happens so many times, he is back in prison on \na violation.   \n \nDo I completely blame the difficulty in getting a birth certificate as the only reason that \nhappened?  No, it is not that simple.  But I frequently wonder, if the system had set him up \nfor success, would the result have been different?  I definitely think it could have been.  If we \nwant to provide people a chance at getting it right, we have to set them up for success outside \nof  prison.    A  birth  certificate  and  identification  in  their  true  name  would  be  the  bare \nminimum they could expect.  I am here today in support of A.B. 16.   \n \nI want to make an additional comment.  While you were asking questions, I did some \nresearch.  There are many states that have waivers—even if you live out of state, they \nprovide waivers for your birth certificate if you are incarcerated.  I agree we need to think \nabout people who are from other states, but it looks like there is a potential solution to that \nproblem if we work together.  \n \nNick  Shepack,  Program  and  Policy  Associate,  American  Civil  Liberties  Union  of \nNevada:  \nI am very happy to be in support of a Nevada Department of Corrections bill, something I do \nnot  get  to  do  every  day.    Leaving  prison  and  starting  life  is  hard  for  even  the  most \nwell-supported, formerly incarcerated individual.  Obtaining important documents, such as \nlicenses, birth certificates, and social security cards, can be a confusing and daunting task for \nthe average person.  Imagine how hard it is for someone who has spent 20 years or more \nincarcerated.  The world is different than they remember it.  Simple daily tasks, such as \nshopping for food, can be overwhelming.  While we are very happy the Department of \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 17, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nCorrections has decided to try to make this change, if we truly want a system that works to \nensure successful reentry, we must provide incarcerated people with the tools to succeed.  \nThis includes important personal documents.  These documents need to be in the possession \nof their rightful owner upon release.  We urge the Nevada Department of Corrections to work \nwith us and families on their legislation this session so that we may continue to show up in \nsupport.  While this bill needs no amendment, we believe we can find common ground on \nmost of the proposed legislation.  We urge this Committee to pass this simple and meaningful \nlegislation and continue to work on any effort that will make reentry into society easier for \nour soon-to-be neighbors. \n \nJim Hoffman, representing Nevada Attorneys for Criminal Justice: \nWe think this is a good bill; we support this for the reasons everyone else has given.  \nIn response  to  Assemblywoman  Summers-Armstrong's  concern,  we  would  note  there  is \nanother step that could be taken.  This bill just applies to Nevada Department of Corrections; \nit  applies  to  people  who  are  in  prison,  but  a  lot  of  people  who  are  incarcerated  for \nmisdemeanors in county jails also have this kind of problem, and there is nothing in the bill \nthat helps them.  There is nothing in existing law that helps with it.  We think that would be \none opportunity to strengthen it, but as previously stated, even without amendment, this is \na good bill, and we support it.  \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe have no more testifiers in support.  Is there anyone in opposition?  [There was no one.]  \nIs there anyone neutral?  [There was no one.]  Are there any closing remarks? \n \nCharles Daniels: \nThank you for allowing us to present this bill.  We think this is a win/win for everyone.  We \nlook forward to presenting legislation of this nature before you because we genuinely believe \nit is impactful and meaningful; there is no downside to this. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 16.  At this time, I will take public comment. \n \nYarleny Roa-Dugan, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \nI am a registered nurse in Las Vegas.  I am a member of the Patient Protection Commission, \nand  I  am  an  executive  board  member  of  the  Service  Employees  International  Union \nLocal 1107.  At this time, I would like to testify on my personal opinion. \n \nI  am  here  today  because  this  Committee  heard  an  overview  of  the  Patient  Protection \nCommission from the executive director.  I feel compelled to speak from my personal \nexperience  sitting  on  the  Commission  as  one  of  the  two  patient  advocates.    I  have \nexperienced that having only two patient advocates does not sufficiently represent Nevada \npatients' views, opinions, and concerns.  Also, there is a lack of patient participation during  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 17, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nmeetings, and the Commission hears mostly from health care organizations.  If given the \nopportunity, I would encourage this body to consider my testimony and increase patient \nadvocates in the commission.   \n \nThank you for hearing my testimony.  I welcome the opportunity to further discuss this with \nyou at any time or answer any questions you may have. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThere is no further public comment.  Are there any comments from members?  [There were \nnone.]  Our next meeting will be next Monday, February 22, at 1:30 p.m.  The meeting is \nadjourned [at 2:37 p.m.] \n \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nJoan Waldock \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nAssemblywoman Rochelle T.

We will be hearing two \nbills today.  We will be hearing testimony, and then Committee members will have an \nopportunity to ask questions of the bill presenters.  After that, we will allow testimony from \nthe public for a maximum of two minutes each and we will be timing the testimony to make \nsure everyone is given a fair opportunity to speak.  We will go between support, opposition, \nand neutral testimony, and then we will complete our meeting with public testimony. \n \nWe  will  open  the  hearing  on  Assembly  Bill  35,  and  our  bill  sponsor  will  begin  the \npresentation. \n \nAssembly  Bill  35:    Revises  provisions  governing  certain  programs  to  assist  senior \ncitizens and persons with disabilities with costs relating to health care. (BDR 40-\n288) \n \nRique  Robb,  Deputy  Administrator,  Aging  and  Disability  Services  Division, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services: \nThank you for the opportunity to introduce Assembly Bill 35.  I will be co-presenting with \nJeff Duncan, our unit chief.  The intent of this bill is to provide some cleanup language \nthroughout the chapter; to consolidate the senior and disability prescription drug program to \nremove the lengthy income and eligibility requirements as well as to align the definitions of \n\"senior\" and \"persons with disability\" in Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 427A. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 22, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nAs you will see throughout A.B. 35, we are proposing to update the statute and also be able \nto serve a broader scope of individuals beyond just those who are Medicare-eligible.  Our \nunit chief will walk you through the specific highlights throughout the bill.   \n \nJeff Duncan, Unit Chief, Aging and Disability Services Division, Department of Health \nand Human Services: \nIn section 1, language has been added to define a \"person with a disability\" which aligns with \nour definition under NRS Chapter 427A and many of our other Aging and Disability Services \nDivision programs. \n \nSection 2 is cleanup language to add senior citizens and the newly defined \"person with a \ndisability\" that appeared in section 1.  Sections 2 through 5, 7 through 11, and 14 all include \nlanguage to consolidate the Nevada Senior and Disability RX Program and the Senior RX \nProgram.  Both programs receive allocations from the Fund for a Healthy Nevada and make \nup a single budget account.  They currently operate as a single program. \n \nSections 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 through 11 of this bill propose minor cleanup language to ensure \nservices may be provided to senior citizens and persons with a disability.  In addition, under \nsection 4, this strikes repetitive language included in other sections of the bill that does not \nhave an impact on the services throughout. \n \nIn section 6, this bill proposes to amend the language of a \"senior citizen\" to \"a person who is \n60 years of age or older.\"  This definition change of a \"senior citizen\" will align with NRS \nChapter  427A,  our  independent  living  grant  programs,  and  the  Older  Americans  Act \nprograms which are all administered by the Aging and Disability Services Division. \n \nSection 8 proposes to remove the specific income and eligibility requirements that currently \ngovern the senior prescription program and the disability prescription program.  There have \nbeen many changes to Medicare since the inception of these programs, and this change will \nallow the agency to adapt the program based on need through regulation.  Specifically, this \nbill will now require a senior citizen or person with a disability who wishes to receive \nassistance under the consolidated program to be a resident of the state and meet requirements \nprescribed by regulation under our Department. \n \nSection 8 also removes language stating that a senior citizen is entitled to an annual grant \nunder the program and provides clarifying language that a senior citizen \"or person with a \ndisability . . . may receive assistance.\"  In addition, section 8 revises language relating to the \nwaiver eligibility requirements. \n \nSection 12 of this bill authorizes information contained in an application for the program to \nbe shared only for purposes relating to the administration of programs of the Department.   \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 22, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI believe we have some questions. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank you for bringing this forward.  Definitions are always changing, and we certainly need \nto stay updated and make sure folks get appropriate services.  I want to make sure these \nchanges are consistent with what the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) \nfederal guidelines are.  Since most of Medicare is controlled by the federal government, \nI want to make sure, especially when we talk about our senior citizens, that it is all consistent \nwith what the federal government says.  I know there will be some dual enrollees.  We have \nsenior citizens on Medicare, we have folks who are on Medicaid who qualify for both.  \nI want to make sure that the federal guidelines are consistent with what you are moving \nforward.   \n \nRique Robb: \nI will have Jeff Duncan confirm that, but he has been working through CMS guidelines, and \nI will have him clarify that. \n \nJeff Duncan: \nIt depends on which part of the bill we are talking about.  If you go back to the section \nconcerning people age 60-plus, Medicare eligibility is still age 65-plus and people with a \ndisability can qualify, so that is different language.  As far as the current senior disability \nprescription assistance program goes, we will still align with the Medicare definitions for all \nages. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nCould we also look at when you are changing assistance?  In section 8, subsection 2, you are \nchanging those requirements.  What does the federal government look at when it comes to \nsome of these benefits?  Are these aligned? \n \nJeff Duncan: \nWhat specific line are you speaking to? \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nSection 8, subsection 2, where you are striking the Consumer Price Index and some of these \nqualifications and you are striking the requirement to copay.  I have some concerns over \nstriking all of that language.  Earlier in your presentation, you said some of the language was \nduplication and would be picked up in other areas, but this language does not seem to be \npicked up in other areas.  There is not going to be any copay for prescriptions any longer.  \nI need some clarification on the decision behind the striking of that particular language. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 22, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nJeff Duncan: \nWe will still have eligibility information in the regulation.  The reason for striking it out of \nthe law is that Medicare, like many other programs, changes over time, so those are just to \nallow the agency to adapt the program to meet the needs through regulations.  We will still \nhave some language that will be spelled out in regulation, just not in the statute. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nIt  is  important  that  we  get  the  legislative  intent  concerning  why  you  are  striking  this \nlanguage.  So, the intent is to be more fluid.  You want to make sure you are fluid with what \nthe federal mandates are.  As you and I know, you cannot predict where CMS is going with \nsome of these regulations, but I want to make sure that what this does is help the state stay \ncurrent with what the federal mandates are because they supplement us.  It allows you to be \nmore  fluid  and  current  with  what  the  federal  guidelines  are,  and  your  intent  is  to  use \nregulations and take it out of statute.  Is that what I am hearing? \n \nJeff Duncan: \nThat is perfectly said. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI appreciate your having the patience to get that legislative intent on here.  It is always \nimportant.  I am excited about any bill that consolidates and makes things more efficient.  As \npeople practicing in the field, we do not have to come back every two years to update things, \nespecially with the interplay between the federal government and us.  Are there any other \nquestions? \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nI would like clarification.  In section 6, we are redefining \"senior citizen\" to 60 years of age \nor older, but in section 13 a senior citizen means a person who is domiciled in the state and is \n62 years of age or older.  Is that on purpose to have those be different?  Can you explain that? \n \nJeff Duncan: \nSection 13 does not apply directly to us; that language is spelling out what is already in NRS.  \nIf you go back to section 6, that language aligns our chapter with the age that is in the Older \nAmericans Act which administers similar programs.  Section 13 language does not have an \nimpact on the other sections of the bill. \n \nRique Robb: \nSection 13 applies to NRS 612.607 and does not relate to this particular program, so we are \nnot making those changes.  We are only making the relations between Chapters 439 and \n427A. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 22, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any follow-up questions to the ones asked by Assemblywomen Peters and Titus?  \n[There were none.]  At this time, we will hear testimony in support, opposition, and neutral \nof A.B. 35.  Please remember to clearly state and spell your name for the record.  We will \nlimit your testimony to two minutes, and we will begin with support testimony for A.B. 35. \n \nCharlie Shepard, State President, AARP Nevada: \n[Charlie Shepard submitted written testimony Exhibit C].  Nevada's older adults and persons \nwith disabilities want to remain living at home, where they want to be.  The Fund for a \nHealthy Nevada provides a variety of services that help them maintain their independence \nand stay healthy.  Assembly Bill 35 removes current restrictions and will allow the programs \nto meet the needs in the community.  AARP Nevada, on behalf of our 345,000 members \nacross the Silver State, supports A.B. 35 and urges the Committee to pass it to increase the \nnumber of people who can receive the services they need to stay healthy and independent. \n \nBrandy Novicka, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada:  \nI have been a resident of Nevada since 2006.  I have been through quite a nightmare in my \nsituation of being disabled.  I have spina bifida, a birth defect.  My nightmare concerns the \nencounters of trying to get assistance which included Medicaid, Medicare, being a single \nmother of one child, and having had my third spinal fusion in 2018 and being forced to have \nto apply for disability.  I was put through a nightmare.  My case was number one in the State \nof Nevada.  I was turned away from every government agency in Las Vegas.  Why?   We still \ndo not know.  In June 2019 my daughter and I were homeless.  I am 38 and at the time, my \ndaughter was 9 years old.  I attended many disability events in Nevada, even spoke to \nAssemblywoman Titus in regard to my issue.  No one was giving me solutions.  I was simply \ntold to pretty much go back to where I came from or move to a richer state, and that the State \nof Nevada is too broke to help people like me. \n \nI also was told it would take three to five years to be seen by a judge in the State of Nevada \nto be given disability.  I encountered this black hole due to my age.  Because I was not over \n50, I was made to feel that I was not important and to just leave the state.  I feel that when \nthese programs are implemented they all sound good on paper, but when you have these \npeople who work for your government agencies, they do not follow the rules and they make \nevery effort to push us out.  I think better training needs to be involved, but also the fact that \nI was discriminated against because of my age. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe are limited to two minutes, and it seems as though your comments would be better suited \nfor public comment at the end of this hearing.  I see you are trying to tie your situation into \nthis bill, and I appreciate that, but if you would like to wait on the call or call back at the end \nof the meeting, there is a time for public comment as well. \n \nBrandy Novicka: \nOkay, thank you. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 22, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIs there anyone else on the line in support?  [There was no one.]  One of the comments from \nthe representative from AARP Nevada led to additional follow-up questions. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThe gentleman who testified in favor of this bill from AARP sparked a question concerning \nexpanding the eligibility for these programs.  Does the Division have any idea how many \nmore folks will now be able to qualify for this or what any potential costs might be?  If you \nare not prepared to answer now, perhaps you could bring that information back to us.  I think \nit is relevant to the conversation on the impact of this bill.  It is not just cleanup language, \nthere is a potential impact, and it may expand the number of folks who would now qualify for \nthese services.  I am curious how many that might be. \n \nRique Robb: \nWe will have to get that information for you and report back to the Committee. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nWe are expanding this and not just changing language.  There may be some important costs \nto this.  Not that they are not justified; we simply need to look at the whole picture when we \naddress this and what this policy would do to the state. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI want to make sure I understand the intent of this—such as most of the stricken language \nI see here.  The Fund for a Healthy Nevada is a finite fund.  There is a grant approval \ncommittee that will look at applications, there is a community-based needs assessment plan, \nand the grants are matched up to that.  Does this language change allow for new grantees to \napply for dollars that we have not seen before?  I was thinking that is probably the opening \nwe are looking for.  Is there something new happening that we have not been able to get to \nand we want to make sure they can be defined into just applying?  Not that they would \nnecessarily get the grant, but they could apply.  Is that right? \n \nRique Robb:  \nNo, this is a program that is already receiving funding within the Aging and Disability \nServices Division.  This is not asking for additional or new Fund for a Healthy Nevada funds \nto grant out.  This is a current program.  We want to have the language available and have it \nmore fluid to where we can actually provide services to the groups we have.  The change \nAssemblywoman Titus was referencing is the change in the age from 62 to 60, and that is \nwhat we would be researching—if there were additional persons who would qualify due to \nthe fluidity of the program, then we would be able to monitor that closely. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI know we had some technical difficulties with one of our callers in support, but is there \nanyone else in support of this bill online? \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 22, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nMarlene Lockard, representing Retired Public Employees of Nevada: \nWe are in support of the bill and appreciate the opportunity to testify. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any callers in opposition to A.B. 35?  [There was no one.]  Do we have any callers \nin neutral?  \n \nSteven Cohen, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \nI would like to echo some of the previous testimony that will be reintroduced during public \ncomment.  I will soon be subject to Medicare.  It has been not quite as bad a nightmare, but \nas some Committee members know, dealing with insurance companies is never fun.  I will let \nmy full remarks be heard during public comment.  I would be happy to work with the agency \nand your Committee to meet in the middle. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you, Mr. Cohen.  If you want to wait on the line until public comment, that would be \nmore appropriate unless you have any direct comments in neutral for this bill.  At this time, \nI will turn it back over to the bill presenters.  Do you have any closing statements? \n \nRique Robb: \nI just want to thank you for the opportunity to present A.B. 35 and we look forward to \nworking with you all through this process. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIf Committee members have any follow-up questions after the close of this hearing today, \nplease reach out to the Department of Health and Human Services and our presenters.  I am \nsure they would be more than happy to further explain their intent or answer any detailed \nquestions you might have.  With that, I will close the hearing on A.B. 35 and open the \nhearing on Assembly Bill 119.  I believe Committee staff sent out documentation from the \n2019 Session that created the Maternal Mortality Review Committee.  Hopefully, everyone \nhas had an opportunity to review that.  Now, I will turn this over to Assemblywoman \nThomas. \n \nAssembly  Bill  119:    Revises  provisions  relating  to  the  Maternal  Mortality  Review \nCommittee. (BDR 40-740) \n \nAssemblywoman Clara Thomas, Assembly District No. 17: \nI  am  introducing  Assembly  Bill  119  which  revises  provisions  relating  to  the  Maternal \nMortality Review Committee.  With me today is my daughter, Edina Flaathen, who will \nshare her personal story later. \n \nBefore I begin, I would like to point out two exhibits, which you can find on the Nevada \nElectronic Legislative Information System.  First, you will find a link to a Centers for \nDisease  Control  and  Prevention  (CDC)  report  on  racial/ethnic  disparities  in  pregnancy-\nrelated deaths [Exhibit D].  Please take a look at the tables on pages 763-764. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 22, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nAdditionally, Kyra Morgan, State Biostatistician from the Department of Health and Human \nServices (DHHS), submitted an exhibit with additional information on disparate impacts of \nmaternal morbidity and maternal mortality on people of color [Exhibit E].  Both Ms. Morgan \nand her colleague, Vickie Ives, Section Manager of Maternal, Child and Adolescent Health at \nDHHS, will be available to respond to any questions later. \n \nIn 2019, the Nevada Legislature clearly recognized unnecessarily high rates of maternal \nmortality in the state when it established the Maternal Mortality Review Committee, in short, \nMMRC.  At the time, Nevada was one of only a handful of states without an MMRC.  These \ncommittees identify and review maternal mortality—a maternal death that happens within \none  year  of  pregnancy—as  well  as  trends  in  severe  maternal  morbidity,  or  significant \ncomplications that arise from a birth but do not lead to death.  Based on these reviews, the \nMMRC  is  tasked  with  developing  recommendations  to  prevent  maternal  mortality  and \nmorbidity and disseminating them to health care providers and the public. \n \nNot much has changed since 2019.  Maternal mortality rates remain high in the United States \nand Nevada.  Nationwide, an estimated 700 women die of pregnancy-related causes each \nyear, and 65,000 women experience serious health complications—rates nearly double those \nof other industrialized countries.  Today, I bring A.B. 119 before you to acknowledge and \nbegin to address a significant issue that is also deeply personal:  racial and ethnic disparities \nin maternal and infant mortality.  While Black women make up 11 percent of Nevada's \npopulation,  they  account  for  33  percent  of  pregnancy-related  deaths.    Native-American \nwomen represent just over 2 percent of the state population and account for 22 percent of \npregnancy-related deaths.  Rates of severe maternal morbidity among Black, Asian-Pacific- \nIslander, and Native-American women are similarly stark, at twice the rate of white women.   \n \nSimilar disparities exist for infants of color.  Black infants and Native Hawaiian/Pacific- \nIslander infants are more than twice as likely to die as white or Hispanic infants.  Infant \nmortality rates for Native-American and Native-Alaskan infants are not far behind. \n \nAssembly Bill 119 aims to address this unacceptable reality by requiring the MMRC to \ncollect data to quantify and measure disparities in the incidence of maternal mortality and \npreventable infant deaths affecting people of color in Nevada, and it requires a summary of \nthis data to be included in the MMRC's biennial report. \n \nIt is my hope in proposing this bill that the MMRC collects the data it needs to take a deeper \nlook  at  these  very  real  issues  and  provide  concrete  policy  recommendations  to  reduce \ndisparities that we can implement to protect and improve the lives of Nevadans. \n \nI do not have any amendments to present to you today, but I am working with stakeholders \nfor a possible amendment to the bill.  I will make sure to share any possible amendments \nwith you prior to a work session.  Now, I would like to hand it over to my daughter, Edina, \nwho will share some personal experiences regarding this topic. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 22, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nEdina Flaathen, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \nI am 36 years old, a wife, and mother of four.  In 2008, my husband and I were very happy to \nfind we were expecting a baby girl.  I went through much of my pregnancy with prenatal care \nand joyfully prepping for our daughter's arrival.  I had been ill most of the time but would \njust chalk it up to morning sickness.  I started noticing a lot of swelling in my feet and ankles \nand would always ask my obstetrician (OB) if this was normal.  He would brush it off and \nsay that it was probably hereditary:  \"My mom got swollen when she was pregnant.  That is \nwhy.\"  Those were his words.  That always seemed off to me because, as a new mom, I was \nreading everything and it did not sound normal, but he was my OB and he went to medical \nschool, so I just listened. \n \nIt was not until about two weeks before my due date that someone finally noticed something \nwas wrong.  I was under the care of another nurse practitioner because mine had left to go on \nvacation.  While seeing someone new worried me, she became one of my biggest blessings.  \nWe asked if my swelling was normal and she automatically said no and ordered blood work \nand a 24-hour urine test.  The next day I received a call that I had preeclampsia and I needed \nto proceed to the hospital and start the process of delivery right away.   \n \nThey let me try as long as possible to deliver on my own, but ultimately my blood pressure \nrose too high and our healthy baby girl was delivered via C-section.  If it had not been for the \ncare and quick thinking of my new nurse practitioner, I would have been in grave danger, and \nI was told that on many occasions. \n \nI went on to have another healthy baby with no complications in 2010 and what I thought \nwas a perfect delivery, until I got pregnant with my third child in 2013.  We found out this \none was a boy and were very excited.  Once again, I had been extremely sick, but other than \nthat, all seemed well until an ultrasound revealed I had placenta previa.  As a precaution, \nI was to be monitored every two weeks.  At 27 weeks, I suddenly heard a pop, which was \nfollowed by a lot of pain.  My husband decided I needed to go to the hospital where lots of \ntests were run and there was a lot of head-scratching, trying to figure out what was wrong.  \nI started  early  labor,  but  they  were  able  to  control  that with  medication.    Early  in  the \nmorning, my high-risk doctor had called to check on me.  She told the nurses that she was \ngoing to come in because she was concerned that I had been bleeding internally.  Everything \nafter that is a blur, but I was told that my uterus had ruptured due to a prior poor surgical \nprocedure with my second child.  My operating room (OR) doctor was very angry and said it \nwas a miracle that I had lived.  I had lost over two liters of blood and needed several \ntransfusions, but ultimately, my baby boy was kept safe by my having placenta previa to \nprotect him.  Other than an early delivery, he has grown into a very spunky child with no \nsigns of developmental issues.  Due to the work of my OR doctors, I was able to get pregnant \none last time, and I delivered another healthy baby girl who is now approaching her nine-\nmonth mark.  I am thankful for the doctors who did not push my concerns aside and provided \nproper care.  Thank you for your time and your willingness to listen to my story. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 22, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you for sharing your story.  Personal stories like this touch home and remind us why \nwe are doing what we are doing here today.  Are there any further remarks or would you like \nto take questions? \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nYes, I am ready to answer any questions Committee members may have. \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nThis is such an important issue.  I worked for the March of Dimes for 15 years, and hearing \nthis story gets my heart.  Would you be willing to do an amendment to add me onto this bill? \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nYes. \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nI have a question in section 1 at lines 19 through 22 where the language talks about collecting \ninformation on preventable infant deaths as well.  Will this morph into the fetal infant \nmortality review as well and combine the two programs? \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nYes, that is what the bill would include.  I would like to turn this over to DHHS.  I believe \nthey have some information that would clearly address your question. \n \nVickie  Ives,  Section  Manager,  Maternal,  Child  and  Adolescent  Health,  Division  of \nPublic and Behavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services: \nWe have one fetal infant mortality review committee in the state, and that is in Washoe \nCounty.  There is no statewide fetal infant mortality review, but maternal mortality review \ncommittees review the maternal mortality and then the fetal infant mortality reviews look at \nthat as infant and fetal demise and how to prevent them.  In terms of a statewide fetal infant \nmortality review, there is not one currently, just the Washoe County Health District one \nspecifically for that county.  However, there is a network of child death reviews within the \ndifferent counties and they do consider all child fatalities, including infants—which is birth \nto one year—within their scope.  The Maternal Mortality Review Committee does not review \ninfant deaths. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nWhen I said there were amendments being worked on with stakeholders, that would also \ninclude that information.  It is necessary to get both data, especially when we are losing \nBlack and Brown and indigenous children along with their mothers.  So it is important for us \nto get that data. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 22, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nThank you for that clarification.  I was curious if this was going to encompass both programs \ninto one.  I was aware that there was a Fetal Infant Mortality Review (FIMR) in Washoe.  \nBecause this language says adding in the preventable infant deaths as well, I was not sure if \nyou were looking at establishing a FIMR statewide as well or if it would be encompassed \nwithin the maternal review. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nWe can look into that. \n \nAssemblyman Matthews: \nI have a question regarding section 1, subsection 1, paragraph (c), subparagraph (2).  How \nwould the term \"persons of color\" be defined for the purposes of this bill? \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nIt is incumbent upon us to clarify that we are looking specifically for the terminology of \nBlack women and Brown women and indigenous women.  For so long we have encountered \nthe term \"women of color\" and we want to specify those women of color. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nMs. O'Krent, do you know if there is a definition that defines that in statute or common or \ncase law? \n \nKarly O'Krent, Committee Counsel: \nThere is not a definition of \"persons of color\" with regard to Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) \nChapter 442 that I am aware of.  Often, we refer to Black, indigenous, and people of color \nthroughout the NRS, so I am happy to add a definition if that is something the Committee \nwould be interested in doing when we craft an amendment for this bill. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nIn that same section, is there an available definition for \"preventable infant deaths\"? \n \nKarly O'Krent: \nThere is not an available definition for \"preventable infant deaths.\"  If it is the pleasure of the \nCommittee, that could be fleshed out further so that whoever is examining preventable infant \ndeaths would be able to identify what might fall under that category.  For example, is it an \ninfant death that is somehow associated with the maternal mortality itself, or is it an infant \ndeath that is unrelated to the death of the mother of the child? \n \nAssemblywoman Krasner: \nThank you, Assemblywoman Thomas, for bringing this bill.  I was wondering if I, too, could \nplease be added as a cosponsor of this legislation. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nYes, I appreciate that. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 22, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI am a proud supporter of this bill and was happy to sign on when asked because I think it \nfalls right in line with our push to make sure we can fix any disparities in health care in the \nstate that we can.  How can we fix them if we do not know where they are or where they \nstart?     \n \nMy question concerns clarifying section 1, subsection 2.  As Assemblywoman Peters asked, \nI, too, would like to see somewhere in writing the \"preventable infant deaths\" defined, \nwhether it is a therapeutic abortion someone has that might be preventable—if something \nwas born at 27 weeks, it is certainly a viable child born alive and we were able to save that \nchild—maybe we do not want to get into the weeds on this, but I think we need some \nclarification on what is a \"preventable\" death.  If that baby dies intrauterine because you have \npreeclampsia and then went into eclampsia, that is a preventable death.  However, we know \nsome infants have health issues.  We know that about one-third of all pregnancies end up in a \nmiscarriage because those infants were not viable.  So I think if we could tease some of that \nout.  Maybe it is impossible, and we will have to leave it the way it is, but I would appreciate \ngiving some thought to that.  This is really about where Assemblywoman Peters was going \nwith it and having a definition on what is a \"preventable infant death\" for some clarity, \nbecause there could be arguments on both sides.  We want this bill to go forward, so I would \nlike to make sure we have that clarified. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nI have a follow-up comment.  I do not want to belabor the point, but we really appreciate this \nbill.  I think it is one of the most important things we could be doing for women of color and \nequity issues.  I want to ensure that as we look towards definitions and how we establish the \ndata collection, that we are engaging physicians who focus on communities of color and \nensure that we are defining these particular issues as they relate to the community that we are \nspecifically addressing in this bill. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nWill you put on the legislative record the specific data that you would hope to collect?  The \nCommittee has the power to subpoena and it is able to—is designed to—look at this in a \nclinical way, subject to the purview of the open meeting law, and there is confidentiality \nsurrounding that.  Knowing that, there are lots of protections around making sure that this \ndata does stay in a clinical purview.  For the legislative record, as the Committee moves \nforward, what would be your hope for the additional types of data you would either like to \ncollect or see teased out? \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nI wish I could answer that.  We are set to have a meeting this week with the stakeholders to \ngo  over information  that  will  be pertinent to  this  bill  and  any  amendments  to  it.   So, \nunfortunately, I am not able to answer your question directly. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 22, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nThat is great because we know that oftentimes—and this concerns legislative intent—if we \nare not talking with stakeholders, our legislative intent may not match up.  What we think is \nreally easy to get, stakeholders just look at us cross-eyed.  I think it is wonderful, and I guess \nwe will see that language come down the road. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre  there  further  questions  from  the  Committee?    [There  were  none.]    I  know \nAssemblywoman Thomas is continuing to work on this. We all probably agree that we want \nto get it right if we are going to pass this, and I know she will continue to work with those \nstakeholders, taking into consideration some of the questions and comments here today.  \nWith  that,  I  will  go  to  testimony  in  support,  opposition,  and  neutral,  beginning  with \ntestimony in support.   \n \nKatie Robbins, representing Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada: \nWe would like to voice our support for A.B. 119.  The United States has the highest maternal \nmortality rate among similarly wealthy countries, with Black women having a maternal \nmortality rate of double their white counterparts.  This statistic is unacceptable.  We applaud \nthe Committee for taking steps to research and address these issues in Nevada so we can \nmake childbirth a safer process for everyone, no matter your race or socioeconomic status.  \nPlanned  Parenthood  Votes  Nevada  welcomes  these  changes  to  the  Maternal  Mortality \nReview Committee and looks forward to working together to address the disparities in our \nhealth care system. \n \nKelly Bumgarner, Director of Health Policy, Children's Advocacy Alliance: \nAs director of health policy at the Children's Advocacy Alliance, on behalf of myself and \nDr. Tara Raines, I would like to express support of A.B. 119.  The Maternal Mortality \nReview Committee is a progressive step in promoting preventive care and healthy outcomes \nfor  all  birthing  persons  and  babies  in  Nevada.    Unfortunately, their most  recent  report \nindicated vast room for improvement.  The recommendations were narrow and did not \nprovide resources for action and programming.  Assembly Bill 119 could improve reporting \nby  tracking  morbidity  and  disparities  by  race,  which  would  enable  more  robust \nrecommendations to guide preventive services.   \n \nAs advocates and data scientists, we also encourage reporting economic and geographic \ndisparities.  This would allow our state to allocate preventive programs and interventions to \nareas  of  greatest  need.    We  hope  the  Committee  supports  all  efforts  by  pertinent \norganizations  to  secure  funding,  including  federal  Health  Resources  and  Services \nAdministration grants, for innovation in maternal health.  Finally, we implore the Committee \nto consider a variety of birthing models when addressing section 1, subsection 1, paragraph \n(f), subparagraph (4).  Low intervention birthing approaches, including midwifery care and \nthe use of doulas, have been shown to decrease morbidity and mortality in uncomplicated \nbirths,  especially  for  Black  and  Brown  birthing  persons.    We  would  like  to  thank  the \nCommittee for their diligence on this most important and difficult task. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 22, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nMarlene Lockard, representing Nevada Women's Lobby: \nWe are in support of A.B. 119.  We feel that collection of data is the key to discovery of \nmany possibilities, responses, and solutions that may affect the mortality rate of women in \nthis country and specifically in this state. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIs there anyone else wishing to testify in support?  [There was no one.]  Is there anyone \nwishing to testify in opposition?  [There was no one.]  Is there anyone neutral on A.B. 119?   \n \nArielle Edwards, Government Affairs Specialist, City of North Las Vegas: \nI am actually in support, but I was having technical difficulties.  We would like to state for \nthe record that we are proud to support A.B. 119.  We want to thank the bill's sponsor for \nbringing forward this important piece of legislation.  The city knows that the maternal \nmortality rate showcases significant and wide disparities in maternal mortality and morbidity \nespecially in Black and indigenous communities of color.  Therefore, we believe that this \nCommittee is essential and an important effort in ensuring that the maternal mortality rate \nshrinks in the state of Nevada. \n \n[The following caller misunderstood and waited for public comment to express support for \nthe bill.  Chair Nguyen asked that her testimony be included here.] \n \nRobin Franklin, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \nI want to express my full support for this bill.   My mother had an old saying that \"death \ncircles a woman's head 99 times.\"  Well, in this day and age, double it for a woman of color.  \nA CDC study that took place between 2007 and 2016 found that a disproportionate amount \nof women of color had higher mortality rates compared to that of white women.  I could tell \nyou countless stories, but my story is frightening.  I am an African-American woman.  I was \n28 years old, being induced, and because I was giving birth to a pretty big baby, I was high \nrisk.  The medication administered to me that induced me repeatedly put my child in distress.  \nIt was administered to me three times with the same result.  The hospital staff then broke my \nwater, which ultimately gave me an infection.  Imagine the doctor coming to me and my \nmother basically telling me that if I did not agree to an emergency C-section, that my mother \nwould have to choose whom to save.  No grandparent should be faced with that decision.  \nThis story is not uncommon, even if a situation is slightly different.  This could have ended \ndifferently, but I was blessed to have a mother who advocated for me, and I left the hospital \nalive.  Sadly, this did not happen for my sister-in-law, who lost her son due to her uterus \nrupturing.   \n \nOversight  is  needed  to  address  this  issue—with  oversight,  data  is  collected  and \nrecommendations are put forth.  True change can happen and save lives.  Women of color \nshould not have to give their lives in order to bring forth life in this age of technology and \neducation. \n  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 22, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIs there anyone in support, in opposition, or in neutral to A.B. 119?  [There was no one.]  \nWould our sponsor like to make any closing remarks? \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nIn closing, A.B. 119 will ensure that the Maternal Mortality Review Committee has a clear \nmandate to review any data concerning health disparities related to pregnancy and birth \namong women of color in our state.  In doing so, we, the Legislature, may make policy \nchanges that provide for better outcomes for our mothers and their children.  I urge you to \nsupport this measure. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWith that, I will close the hearing on A.B. 119. \n \n[Exhibit F was submitted but not discussed and will become part of the record.] \n \nNow we will move to public comment.  As a reminder to those providing public comment, \nplease make sure to clearly state and spell your name and please limit your comments to two \nminutes. \n \nSteven Cohen, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \nI sent staff my longer remarks, and would be happy to address any questions about them \noffline.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank  you  for  your  public  comment.    Any  written  documentation  or  public  comment \nsubmitted in writing within 48 hours of the close of today's hearing will be available on the \nNevada Electronic Legislative Information System for you to view.  We will go to the next \ncaller in public comment.  [Robin Franklin was the next caller.]  Madame Secretary, could \nwe reclassify the testimony we heard just now?  It was not public comment; it was in support \nof A.B. 119.  [The secretary agreed.] \n \nBrandy Novicka, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \nI want to reiterate the importance of addressing disabled people who are under age 60, if not \nunder the age of 40.  Due to my disability of spina bifida and lack of assistance in the state of \nNevada, I was forced to move with my daughter, although she still has a father and family in \nLas Vegas.  I think it is important that we address the issue that disabled people under the age \nof 40 are being forgotten.  They are being told to simply leave the state. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 22, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any other people for public comment in the queue?  [There was no one.]  If you \nwere online and you were unable to contact us, I welcome you to provide your public \ncomment in writing or contact us at our next meeting on Wednesday.  Are there any other \ncomments from Committee members?  [There were none.]  This concludes our meeting for \ntoday.

With me today is Shane Piccinini from the \nFood Bank of Northern Nevada who will assist me with the presentation.  \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAssemblywoman Martinez, I am sorry to interrupt you, but we are having some sound issues. \n \nAssemblywoman Martinez: \nAssembly Bill 138 removes the requirement that a person who has been convicted of certain \nfelony drug offenses complete a treatment program before becoming eligible for Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families (TANF) and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program \n(SNAP) benefits.  Instead, the measure requires a person convicted of such an offense to \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 24, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \ndemonstrate that he or she is not currently possessing, using, or distributing controlled \nsubstances in a manner prohibited by law. \n \nHowever, I am proposing an amendment, which should be available on NELIS, that takes \nthis policy one step further by eliminating the requirement that a person demonstrate to the \nDivision  of  Welfare  and  Supportive  Services  (DWSS)  that  he  or  she  is  not  currently \npossessing, using, or distributing controlled substances [Exhibit C]. \n \nFinally, I would like to add primary and cosponsors to the bill from both the Senate and the \nAssembly.  The primary sponsors are Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson, Assemblyman \nYeager, Senator Cannizzaro, and Senator Ratti.  Cosponsors are Assemblywoman Anderson, \nAssemblywoman Gorelow, Senator Spearman, and Senator Harris. \n \nI would now like to turn the presentation over to Shane Piccinini from the Food Bank of \nNorthern Nevada.  He will provide additional information and background and answer any \ntechnical questions you might have. \n \nShane Piccinini, Manager of Government Relations, Food Bank of Northern Nevada: \nI have a quick presentation to walk through this [Exhibit D].  This prohibition on SNAP and \nTANF benefits dates back to 1996 [page 2, Exhibit D].  The law created a lifetime ban for \nindividuals with these types of convictions, many of whom were in a period of active \naddiction when they attained their convictions [Exhibit E].  In 1996, what Congress did was \nput a blanket ban on this for all 50 states, but it gave the states an option to opt out.  This bill \nwould trigger the opt-out feature for Nevada.  Currently in Nevada when a felon is looking to \nobtain benefits, that individual has to provide documentation.  Some of us have a hard time \nkeeping track of our library cards, so anyone with a conviction after August 22, 1996, would \nhave  to  provide  that  certificate.    As  there  has  been  time  and  history  to  evaluate  the \neffectiveness of this bill, that has proven to be a really unreasonable prohibition on the \nprogram. \n \nLet me give you an update on why it matters [page 3, Exhibit D].  In 2021, 30.8 percent of \nNevadans are food-insecure.  Some of that has to do with the fact that Nevada never fully \nrecovered from the recession of 2008, and some of that has to do with the fact that we are in \nthe middle of a public health crisis.  Nevada's children suffer the highest negative impact \nunder the disqualifications under this current law.   \n \nThe number one food-insecure state in the Union also happens to be one of the states that \nimplements the ban, and that is Mississippi.  On line with Florida, Tennessee, and Alabama, \nthese states in the last year have all moved over to implement a partial ban, but the states that \nhave some sort of ban are definitely some of the states with the highest food insecurity rates.  \nNorth Carolina is the only state left in the Union with a full ban.  There are 25 states that \nhave completely lifted the ban, which is what we are doing with this bill. \n \nWhat the bill accomplishes is pretty straightforward.  It removes the requirement to provide \nany type of documentation for substance abuse treatment, and it removes one of the last \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 24, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nbarriers that anyone in Nevada would need to get food assistance.  People with substance \nabuse convictions are the only ones who are prohibited from accessing these benefits.  No \nother class of criminal conduct is prohibited under U.S. law or Nevada law. \n \nIn  2017,  one  of  the  biggest  reasons  we  decided  to  rethink  this  barrier  is  that  it \ndisproportionately discriminates against minorities.  Black men are six times as likely to be \nincarcerated as white men and Hispanic men are, and Hispanic men are 2.7 times as likely to \nbe convicted as white men are.  For Black men in their thirties, about one in twelve is in \nprison or in jail on any given day.  Women are now the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. \npopulation who are being convicted for substance abuse offenses.  More than 61 percent of \nwomen who are doing time in federal prison right now are in for nonviolent drug offenses.  \nWomen,  and  particularly  women  of  color,  are  disproportionately  affected  by  the  social \nstigma, by plea bargaining agreement systems that punish those who are unable or unwilling \nto inform on others and by regulations that bar people with substance abuse convictions from \nobtaining or that require a drug test to receive public assistance, and by a drug treatment \nsystem designed for men.  Getting access to the drug counseling that is required in this law is \nincredibly complicated.  Also, getting access to the appropriate drug test through the public \ndefender  system  or  through  the  criminal  courts  is  incredibly  complicated.    Often,  the \ndefendant would have to pay for that, which can be prohibitively expensive, depending upon \nthe jurisdiction.  Black women are almost as likely, and Latinas are 20 percent more likely, to \nbe incarcerated than white women.  Native American women are incarcerated at six times the \nrate of their white counterparts, so this is incredibly discriminatory.  People who have an \nupper middle class background have the opportunity to work with the criminal justice system \nto get a different plea arrangement or to get a different conviction that people of color or \npeople who are living below the poverty line just do not have.  There is absolutely no parity \namong the convictions across the 50 states and in different jurisdictions that handle this \nconviction, so that is a big motivator for us on why we want to rethink this. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there questions? \n \nAssemblyman Matthews: \nConcerning the amendment you discussed, if I understand you correctly, there would be \nnothing in place, no requirements in place, for an individual to demonstrate that they have \nceased  use,  possession,  or  distribution  in  order  to  gain  access  to  these  programs.    No \nrequirements whatsoever.  Is that correct? \n \nShane Piccinini: \nThere would be no requirements for them to get access to these benefits, correct. \n \nAssemblyman Matthews: \nHypothetically, there could be someone who had been convicted and conceivably could still \nin an ongoing way not only be perhaps using himself or herself, but actively distributing to \nothers, perhaps even to minors, and would still not be barred from participation and access to \nthese programs.  Am I correct about that as well? \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 24, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nShane Piccinini: \nThat is correct, but what you are describing are matters that need to be addressed by the \ncriminal justice system and not by the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services \n(DHHS). \n \nAssemblyman Matthews: \nHas any analysis been done on the extent to which this would increase eligibility for the \nprogram in terms of numbers?  Do we have any data on how many people are currently \nunable to access these programs because of the requirements who would now access them \nunder this bill?  What might the fiscal impact of that be to the State? \n \nShane Piccinini: \nThere are two answers to your question.  There is no impact to the State.  There are roughly \n400,000 people currently enrolled into the SNAP program, but I cannot tell you the number \nof people enrolled in TANF; however, it is a fairly low number.  Less than 4,000 people \nbetween July 2019 through January of this year were denied because of their substance abuse \nconvictions.  The harder number to get at is the number of people who may have been \neligible through all the other qualifications that are in SNAP and TANF who did not apply \nbecause they knew that they would be denied because of the ban.  There is just no way to \nknow that. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI want to thank you, Shane, and the Food Bank of Northern Nevada for all you are doing in \nthis day of the pandemic and with food insecurity, and throughout the schools.  I have seen \nthe excellent work you and your volunteers do to help with food insecurity.  This has been \na tough time, so, thanks to you and all your workers for what you do. \n \nIn looking at section 1 of the bill, the proposal is to eliminate that a person has actually gone \nthrough a treatment program, and I certainly understand the need to eliminate that.  In all the \ncommittees I have been on—mental health, behavioral health, public health—and as a public \nhealth officer, there are just not enough programs.  To demand that someone has completed \nor entered a program, I absolutely support removing that, because I think that is a barrier.  \nWhen you are asking them to do a program that they cannot possibly do, that is not a parity \nin any way, so I am good with that.  I have not seen the amendment, but is there new wording \nbeing added under section 1, subsection 2, paragraph (a)?  Currently, on the copy I have it \nreads,  \"Demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Division that he or she is not currently \npossessing, using or distributing controlled substances in a manner that is prohibited by law.\"  \nAre you striking all of paragraph (a)?  Is that what the intent of the amendment is? \n \nAssemblywoman Martinez: \nYes, we are striking it all. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 24, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI think I heard that your argument to remove that language was because people could not get \nin for drug testing and that there is a cost to that.  That is a true statement, but I do not see \nthat the language on that line requires that you have drug testing.  I am interpreting this, and \nmaybe we could get our legal counsel to chime in here.  That line just reads \"Demonstrates to \nthe satisfaction of the Division . . .\" that they are not using.  That would be up to that office, \nthe TANF folks and others who are involved in this, food distribution, et cetera, that they are \nnot using.  Nowhere in this bill do I see that it required a drug test. \n \nShane Piccinini: \nThe drug testing piece of that, and perhaps I muddied the waters, but that is something other \nstates have used with similar language.  What we have done with the amendment is to \nremove the language that suggests that, \"to the satisfaction of the Department,\" to say in the \namendment that anybody with a substance abuse conviction could not be denied solely \nbecause of that conviction. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThat is not how I interpreted this.  That line would just require in good faith that they show \nup sober or not impaired.  It is easy to demonstrate that, perhaps, just by showing up.  We \nwould be one of five states that do not have any requirements or anything, I use the term \n\"a carrot,\"  to  help  encourage  these  folks  to  continue  not  using,  so  there  would  be  no \nrestrictions whatsoever in their application. \n \nShane Piccinini: \nThere are currently 25 states that do not have a ban at all, that do not require any of this and \nhave language very similar to what our amendment says. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nWhich is just eliminating any responsibility at all, correct?   \n \nShane Piccinini: \nIt eliminates the requirement for a client applying for food stamps to address their prior \ncriminal activity at all, correct. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nKeeping in there and if I might follow through on this chain, Madame Chair, because already \nin the language is that a person could apply if that person were pregnant, regardless of any of \nthe above language.  Again, because of the expectant mom and unborn child, we want to \nmake sure those folks are taken care of, so there was never a ban on those entities being \neither drug free or in a program.  We had that part still in statute, but what this amendment \nwould do is totally eliminate any obligation, any restriction, any accessibility for the person \nidentified as a felon.  Correct? \n \nShane Piccinini: \nRight. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 24, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe do not have our legal counsel on this call.  They are busy drafting our bill draft request \nnow, but I believe Ms. Swearingen from DWSS and someone from DHHS are on the line to \nanswer any other questions.  I do not know if they have any input on Assemblywoman Titus's \nconcerns regarding that interpretation. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI want clarity that there was never a mandatory drug test in that requirement.  The language \ndid not say you had to have a drug test; it just had to be satisfactorily demonstrated.  That \nwas all I wanted to clarify. \n \nShane Piccinini: \nYes, you are correct.  There was never a mandatory drug test in there. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nI  am  looking  at  our  community  today  and  wondering  about  folks  who  had  a  felony \nconviction from 1997, have been employed for the last 20-30 years, but were laid off because \nof the pandemic.  They have to additionally prove that in 1997 they met the mandatory \nrequirements—which in this are vague, so I imagine they are in regulations—to apply for \nSNAP benefits today, 20 years after their conviction.  Is that correct? \n \nShane Piccinini: \nYes, that is correct, and in Nevada, the requirement, as I recall, was a 30-day treatment \nprogram accredited by the State.  There was a process they would follow to make sure that \nthe rehab program met the standard. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nIf they were unemployed and applied for SNAP benefits but could not prove they had \npreviously gone through that program in 1997 because the records were lost—possibly in \na flood, which happened in 1997—they would have to go through an additional 30-day \ntreatment program 20 years after their conviction to be eligible for SNAP benefits. \n \nShane Piccinini: \nThat is correct, but the caveat to that would be that they may not be allowed into an \nadditional program because they are no longer an active user.  As Assemblywoman Titus \npointed out, there are simply not enough programs in Nevada to meet the current need. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nIn that 20-year time period, say they had three or four children and they were the sole \nprovider for their family.  Would their children have access to that SNAP benefit until they \nwere able to prove that? \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 24, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nShane Piccinini: \nThe children would still get access to SNAP [Exhibit F].  Our concern there is that you would \nhave three people trying to use the benefit that was only for two, if it were a single mom with \ntwo kids, which is generally the case. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nWith the original draft of this bill, in that scenario, what would they have to provide to \ndemonstrate that they are not currently \"possessing, using or distributing\"?  Would they have \nto open their house up for an inspection?  Would they have to pee in a cup?  What kind of \nprocess would they have to go through to demonstrate that 20 years after their conviction, \nafter three kids, that they were not using drugs or currently in possession of drugs in order to \nestablish SNAP benefits? \n \nShane Piccinini: \nThat is incredibly subjective, which is why the language is being removed from the bill.  It \ncould change from one director of the Department of Health and Human Services to another \nif it was done through the regulatory process.  As you can tell in the bill, it does not describe \nwhat that looks like, so we are removing that language.  Making it as clean as possible was \nthe best option. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nI want to reiterate that the language in section 1, subsection 2, paragraph (a), \"Demonstrates \nto the satisfaction of the Division,\" will be removed. \n \nShane Piccinini: \nThat is correct.  In the amendment, that language is completely stricken from the bill. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nAssemblywoman Peters asked my question and covered it in some detail.  I am clear and \nunderstand, and I appreciate the feedback. \n \nAssemblyman Hafen: \nAssemblywoman Martinez, I apologize; this is the first time I have seen the amendment and \nI am trying to understand the clarification of it.  In the bill that was presented to us, in \naddition to those who were using and possessing drugs, there was a requirement for drug \ndealers to demonstrate that they were no longer selling drugs.  Is it your intent to remove that \nrequirement and allow drug dealers now to get these benefits? \n \nAssemblywoman Martinez: \nThis was the category we had, anyone who had a drug offense.  To help them facilitate, they \nhave already gone through the court system [unintelligible]. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI think we have some sound issues with Assemblywoman Martinez.  Is there someone else \nwho could reiterate? \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 24, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nShane Piccinini: \nThe reason we also wanted to include the distribution part of that was because somebody \ncould have been a distributor in 1997, and, as Assemblywoman Peters pointed out, had \na clean track record for a number of years.  The person had done their time, was doing what \nthey were supposed to be doing, so there was no reason to continue to hold this over their \nhead.  Also, what was considered to be a distribution or possession charge in 1996 was \nsubstantially different than it is today.  There is no easy way for us to determine what is or is \nnot an appropriate charge.  All of this is taken care of through the criminal justice system.  \nAgain, it makes no sense for the Department of Health and Human Services to be in that part \nof the work. \n \nAssemblyman Hafen: \nFor  clarification,  the  section  in  the  bill  being  stricken  by  the  amendment  that  says, \n\"Demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Division . . . ,\" you are saying that it is difficult to \nmake those determinations.  More government oversight, and you are trying to get rid of \nsome of that.  Am I understanding that correctly? \n \nShane Piccinini: \nWhat we are trying to do is eliminate a subjective part of the bill.  It may not be applied \nevenly in the State of Nevada, administration over administration.  The cleaner this is, the \nless administrative burden there is for the Department to try to figure out what that means \nand to spend the time trying to track down 20-year old certificates.  Additionally, we want to \nbring parity to the rest of this class of people to everybody else in the population.  This class \nof people is the only one that is denied benefits under the regulations.  In order for this to \nreally be clean, and to allow the Department to do the work that it needs to do, removing this \nbarrier is just common sense. \n \nAssemblyman Matthews: \nQuestions from the Committee covered the extreme ends of the possibilities here.  We talked \nabout how this would allow those who are currently engaging in new use, distribution, \nor possession to access the program.  Assemblywoman Peters brought up the other end of \nthe spectrum that this would bar participation by those who perhaps had their conviction \n20 years ago and perhaps lost the records showing they had gone through treatment.  In \ncrafting this bill, was any thought given to addressing that time frame?  This is going to \nbecome an arbitrary suggestion; I am not saying this is the magic number but, for the sake of \nargument, a conviction more than five or six years into the past, perhaps the requirements in \nthe pre-amended version might be waived.  If the conviction were more recent, then some \nrequirements might make sense.  Was any thought given to that, and, if so, why was that \napproach rejected? \n \nShane Piccinini: \nYes, some thought has been given to that, and the research would also tell you that the people \nwho are actively going through recovery are some of the most vulnerable populations there \nare.  Ensuring that they have access to healthy food ensures a much greater success and \ncompletion in their recovery than if that were not available to them. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 24, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nAssemblyman Matthews: \nAssemblywoman Peters introduced a hypothetical scenario, but the bill was crafted in a way \nnot necessarily to target those but really with an eye toward those who were more recently \nconvicted as opposed to those convicted in the past.  That was the focus of the bill—to really \naddress not so much those whose convictions may have been decades in the past, but those \nfor whom the conviction may have been more recent.  Would that be fair? \n \nShane Piccinini: \nNot necessarily.  What we want to do is make it so the conviction, regardless of when it \nhappened, was not relevant at all. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nIf a person is convicted of driving under the influence (DUI), or convicted of trafficking or \nconvicted of murder, are they barred once they have served their time—whether they did the \nshort end or the long end of conviction?  No matter how long ago they got out, are they \nbarred from participating in any of these programs?  I think what I am hearing is that this is \nstrictly about drugs and nothing else.  Am I wrong? \n \nShane Piccinini:      \nYou are exactly right.  This only has to do with substance abuse.  A murder, white collar \ncrime, DUI, there are no other classifications in the criminal code that would bar somebody \nfrom these programs. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nThose other convictions have no requirements for them to do any type of prove up which was \npart of this law.  Prove up that they are not trafficking, that they are not drinking if they had \na DUI, or not participating in other criminal activities.  They are not required to prove up \nanything in order to get benefits, only those people who have drug convictions.  Is that \ncorrect? \n \nShane Piccinini: \nThat is correct.  Any requirements that the court may impose on those individuals would not \nprevent them from having access to SNAP or TANF. \n \nAssemblywoman Black: \nThe language in this bill mentions being enrolled in or have completed a drug treatment \nprogram, and then verify or somehow prove that you are not using an illegal substance.  \nI thought we said earlier that there was no required drug testing, but how do people verify \nthat they are not on drugs? \n \nShane Piccinini: \nI  do  not  have  any  idea  how  that  would  work.    The  Department  would  have  to  write \nregulations and figure that out. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 24, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nAssemblywoman Black: \nThat is what it says right now. \n \nShane Piccinini: \nThat language is being removed with our amendment. \n \nAssemblywoman Black: \nThe bill as it was originally written says that you are required to either enroll in or have \ncompleted  a  drug  treatment  program  and  you  are  required  to  prove  you  are  not  using \na controlled substance.  Is that wrong? \n \nShane Piccinini: \nThat is how the original bill was written, and that is why we offered the amendment.  It did \nnot offer what we were trying to do, which was eliminate the need for the certificate at all.  \nActually, that is not true.  What we were trying to do was make it so the conviction was not \nrelevant at all toward being approved for benefits. \n \nAssemblywoman Black: \nI am not worried about the conviction part of this.  Say someone comes in, they are actively \nin a treatment program, or they have a certificate that says they completed one.  Then, they \nare required to prove that they are not on a controlled substance.  How do they prove that? \n \nShane Piccinini: \nIn some states other than Nevada, that led to drug testing.  Nevada has never had that, and it \nis our position that Nevada should never adopt that as a policy.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI believe Ms. Swearingen can answer your questions better.  Can you respond to what the \nexisting law is? \n \nLisa Swearingen, Chief, Eligibility and Payments, Division of Welfare and Supportive \nServices, Department of Health and Human Services: \nCurrently the only thing we do when we have been notified that an individual has a felony \ndrug  conviction  is  we  request  the  information  that  they  have  gone  through  a  SAPTA \n[Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Agency]-approved program for drug-related \noffenses.  We have no mechanism to monitor, track, and assure that they are not currently \nusing.  This agency is not HIPAA [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act] \ncompliant; I am not even sure we could request that information.  We cannot know medical \ninformation or health information regarding individuals.  That is done on the Medicaid side.  \nThat is a concern for us—how we would even monitor or implement that type of program. \n \nAssemblywoman Black: \nMaybe it is just a statement that someone makes that says, \"I certify that I am not actively \nusing drugs.\"  I do not think it is too much to ask someone to say, \"I am not using drugs,\" to \nget welfare.  As someone who has had someone in-house, someone with an opioid problem \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 24, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nin their life, I think this is everyone's problem.  I want every possible step along the way for \nthere to be, as Assemblywoman Titus said, a \"carrot\" that incentivizes these folks to get into \nsome sort of treatment program.  I can also understand the idea as Assemblyman Matthews \nsaid, if you were charged thirty years ago, we probably should not still be penalizing you, but \nI feel as though we are throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  Millions of people every \nyear are getting on opioids or other substances.  What about those people?  I feel as though \nthat was the intent of this bill, not to penalize people from 30 years ago, but to help \nincentivize people who are getting on opioids today or selling drugs today.  I understand that \nif we push them too hard and make it too hard to get support, that that almost pushes them \nfarther down that rabbit hole, but we need some sort of middle ground.  Basically, you are \ntaking every single thing off the table here and just saying, do drugs, sell drugs, whatever you \nwant, not our problem, here is your assistance.  As someone with an opioid user in my life, \nthat is a problem for me. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI  appreciate  what  Assemblywoman  Titus,  Assemblywoman  Black,  and  Assemblyman \nMatthews put on the record, but I think that in this bigger conversation we are having about \nhow opioids affect our communities and about how we jail and sentence people, we are \nalways trying to find the right dynamic.  I sponsored this legislation two years ago, and I still \nthink it is meaningful and important.  I appreciate Assemblywoman Martinez bringing it \nforward, because allowing this group of people access to TANF programs is exactly what \nought to happen.  Within that program there are work requirements, there is a personal \nresponsibility plan that you have to put together, there are programs to prevent and reduce \nout-of-wedlock pregnancies.  There are lots of things happening within the TANF program \nthat, if folks have access to it, they would be able to have more state services support and \nmore of those kinds of \"carrots\" as you would say. \n \nThe same way we talk about \"housing first\" for our homeless population, we have to talk \nabout \"feeding first\" for this population.  First and foremost, we have to make sure you are \nfed, and then we are going to address your addiction.  We are going to address your addiction \nby giving you access to programs like TANF, but first we are going to start you off with \nSNAP if you qualify.  I think it is the right thing to do.  I think it makes a lot of sense.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWith that, I will open up the lines for testimony in support, opposition, and neutral on \nA.B. 138.  I will remind people on the line to clearly state and spell your name for the record.  \nWe  will  be  limiting  testimony  to  two  minutes  to  ensure  that  everyone  is  given  a  fair \nopportunity to speak.  Please begin testimony in support. \n \nJodi  Hocking,  Founder,  Return  Strong:  Families  United  for  Justice  for  the \nIncarcerated: \nWe are an organization of over 1,000 members who are either incarcerated, on parole, \nprobation, or have loved ones who are incarcerated.  We want to recognize the value of this \nbill for Nevadans.  This bill will help to reduce barriers to services for both men and women, \nbut  I  want  to  make  special  note  of  women  in  my  statement  today.    According  to  the \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 24, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union, between 2008 and 2018, the number of women in Nevada \nprisons grew by 24 percent, 60 percent of those women are serving time for nonviolent \ncrimes, and one in six are in for drug felonies.  Half of them also have documented mental \nhealth issues.  The majority of these women are connected to families and children who have \nhad to step up and survive without them.  They have children and responsibilities, and the \ntransition home is difficult enough without continuing to create barriers for success and \nincreasing the chance that people with their backs against the wall will make a decision that \nleads them back to prison.   \n \nIf one in six women has a drug felony offense, they cannot get food stamps if they need \nthem.  They are probably also struggling to get a job with a living wage and to find housing.  \nWe need to create communities that allow people a fighting chance to stay free, stay clean \nand sober, rebuild their lives, and stop chaining them to their past.  Food is a basic human \nnecessity, and no one should be barred from any system in place to meet that need regardless \nof their criminal history, especially in regard to people who are battling addiction.  We are \nnot only punishing them but their children who quickly become secondarily impacted.  We \nare in support of A.B. 138.  Just because in 1996 the Personal Responsibility and Work \nOpportunity  Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) was widely implemented and attempted to \nlegalize values, it also has been known to have been destructive to families and communities \nand, specifically, Black, Brown, and poor communities.  It was directly tied to a system of \nmass incarceration.  We support this bill and will continue to support this bill; but looking at \n1996, and not accounting for the changes and the acknowledgement from the government \nthat the war on drugs was a bad move, the Personal Responsibility Act was a bad move.  We \ndestroyed communities and it needs to stop.  Nevada has to do better. \n \nSerena  Evans,  Policy  Specialist,  Nevada  Coalition  to  End  Domestic  and  Sexual \nViolence: \nThank you for bringing this bill forward.  We are in strong support of A.B. 138.  We know \nthat having access to social services such as SNAP and TANF have positive impacts for \nvictim survivors of violence and can be the key for them being able to leave and end an \nabusive relationship.  Without these social service programs that allow victim survivors to \ncare for their children and provide stability, they are more likely to stay in an abusive \nrelationship and endure the violence.  We also know that having access to social services has \nbeen shown to be an effective tool in reducing risk factors for future violence.  As with any \ncommunity, victim survivors of violence can have convictions of drug violence, and they are \njust as deserving of social support.  We are so appreciative of this measure to reduce barriers \nin accessing SNAP and TANF benefits.  Everybody deserves access to food, and everybody \ndeserves access to these truly lifesaving programs. \n \nNick Shepack, Program and Policy Associate, ACLU of Nevada: \nThis bill, with the proposed amendment, seeks to remedy failed War on Drugs policy.  \nWithholding access to food from people who have behavioral health issues is as bad and \nineffective at addressing the issue of substance abuse as it is morally bankrupt as a policy.  \nThis law was created during the \"tough on crime\" period of the 1990s that has led to the mass \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 24, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nincarceration we now struggle with.  Let us be clear.  These laws were an attempt to punish \ncommunities of color for experiencing behavioral health crises by taking away their food. \n \nI want to touch on the difficulty of actually getting somebody into treatment.  When I was \na social  work  intern  with  the  Washoe  County  Public  Defender's  Office,  part  of  my \nresponsibility was getting people into treatment programs.  The facilities, more often than \nnot, had no available beds.  The ones that did have beds had all kinds of restrictions such as \nno violent criminal record, no sex-related criminal record, no category B felonies or above, et \ncetera.  Or they were evangelical institutions which often did amazing work but do not \nalways align with people's beliefs.  Even with a dedicated team of social workers, working as \nhard as they could to get people into treatment, people would languish in jail for weeks or \nmonths while we searched for a placement.  We attempted to try different technologies such \nas one called OpenBeds which would show us which facilities had space available.  Due to \nthe long wait list and lack of availability, it almost always read that nothing was available.  \nGetting into treatment is not as easy as you may think.  It is harder if you do not have any \nmoney or insurance; it is harder if you have a criminal record; it is harder if you live in rural \nareas; and it can feel impossible if you do not have somebody to help you, such as a social \nworker.   \n \nIf the goal of the state is to get people into treatment programs, then you must increase \naccess.  You must make the system easier to navigate.  What you should not do is continue to \nstarve people whose behavioral health issues the state has decided to criminalize.  A felony \ndrug record makes getting housing harder, it makes getting a job harder, and it currently \nmakes getting a meal harder.  You can change this.  It is the right thing to do; it is the moral \nthing to do; it is good, smart policy. \n \nDenise Bolanos, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \nI would like to offer my testimony in support of A.B. 138.  I do not speak here today as the \nwife of an incarcerated person but as an eligibility worker for public assistance benefits in the \nstate of California and a resident of Nevada.  I have seen firsthand the difference this makes \nin the lives of individuals and families.  When California lifted this restriction, families were \nsuddenly able to receive the amount allotted for their household size and income levels \nwithout having to exclude the person with a previous conviction.  Five people still need to eat \nin that home that is only being aided for four people.  People who have just finished serving \ntheir sentence should not have to face food insecurity on top of the other hurdles that people \nface post-release.   \n \nIt seems like a small thing; however, it makes an already hard situation even harder by \nsanctioning the  person with  the  conviction.   These  individuals  currently  excluded  from \nreceiving benefits have already served a sentence for their crimes, so why do they continue to \npay for it along with their children and spouses?  And why is it my place as an eligibility \nworker to deny them these benefits based on a drug conviction?  It seems to me that if \nindividuals  reoffend,  it  is  up  to  the  criminal  justice  system  to  hold  them  accountable.  \nSuccessful reentry is the best way to reduce recidivism, and eliminating this restriction is \na huge step in making reentry successful.  If people are put in a position where they have no \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 24, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nchoice but to fall back to a life of crime to feed themselves and their families, then we cannot \nbe surprised when that happens. \n \nChristine Saunders, Policy Director, Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada: \nWe are here in support of A.B. 138 as amended.  Ultimately, the current modified ban creates \nthree specific challenges that negatively impact public health in our community.  It promotes \nfood insecurity and malnutrition for a person with a felony drug conviction and their family.  \nIt poses a barrier to reintegration into the community and has a disproportionate impact on \npeople of color who were unjustly targeted in the war on drugs.  According to the Drug \nPolicy Alliance, nearly 80 percent of the people in federal prison and almost 60 percent of \npeople in state prison who are there for drug offenses are Black or Latino.   \n \nLimiting access to food for someone and their family is a cruel way to encourage treatment.  \nA recent study by Clemson University found that food insecurity instead actually leads to an \nincrease in crime rates.   By removing this antiquated and punitive restriction, we allow more \nNevadans access to food assistance while working toward increasing equity and ending food \ninsecurity in our state.  We urge you to support this bill. \n \nGillian Block, representing Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers: \nI am speaking in support of A.B. 138.  The SNAP and TANF programs provide a critical \nsafety  net  to  low-income  individuals.    Individuals  with  felony  convictions  already  face \nsignificant barriers to their reentrance into society.  These barriers are particularly steep for \npeople of color who are convicted of drug offenses at much higher rates than white people, \nalthough studies have shown that actual drug usage is roughly the same.  The current law is \na roadblock for people leaving the criminal justice system.  It promotes food insecurity and \nnegatively affects the health and economic security of people with a drug-related felony \nconviction and their families.  The ability to apply for nutrition and safety net benefits helps \npeople get back on their feet.  By helping individuals to lead more stable lives, the SNAP and \nTANF programs improve reentry outcomes and have a positive effect on the lives of people \nwith  a  drug-related  felony  conviction  in  their  family.    For  these  reasons,  the  Nevada \nCoalition of Legal Service Providers supports A.B. 138. \n \nAshanti Lewis, Advocacy Manager, Three Square Food Bank, Las Vegas, Nevada: \nOur  service  area  encompasses  Clark,  Lincoln,  Nye,  and  Esmeralda  Counties  where  we \ndistribute food to agency partners, commonly known as food pantries.  We have had the \nopportunity to work alongside the Food Bank of Northern Nevada, our counterpart in the \nFeeding America network, on A.B. 138 as amended and greatly support this bill. \n \nAs a food bank, we see firsthand the effects of food insecurity, which has been highlighted \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic.  Food banks are well aware of the strength of SNAP \nbenefits and how they provide a boost to the economy while freeing up much-needed money \nfor families and individuals in need.  Statistically, one in five adults in Nevada and one in \nthree children are facing food insecurity.  This is a tremendous mountain to overcome as \na food bank, as it is Three Square's mission to feed hungry people.  The Supplemental \nNutrition Assistance Program helps to alleviate some of the need and dependency on our \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 24, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nfood banks, ultimately allowing us to serve more people.  From a public health perspective, \nThree Square is concerned about any and all barriers to access to food.  We are well aware \nthat individuals and families experiencing food insecurity face many issues such as securing \naffordable housing and employment.  Food should not be one of these barriers as adequate \nnutrition is vital in order to lead and sustain a healthy and productive life. \n \nFederal nutrition programs such as SNAP are the first line of defense against ending hunger.  \nWe strongly believe Nevada must have every option available to improve food security and \nbring tools to the state that ensure all Nevadans have equal access to federal nutrition \nprograms to help them become food secure in a sustainable way. \n  \nAyanna Oglesby, Private Citizen, Reno, Nevada: \nI am calling in support of A.B. 138.  I agree with some of the previous callers.  The food \ninsecurity rate is astronomical, along with the education and incarceration in the state of \nNevada.  However, we are here about felony drug offenses and their eligibilities. \n \nI am in agreement because housing and employment are already hard enough challenges for \nthese people.  Getting food should not be.  The more restrictions implicated, it elevates \npeople's  desperation.    It  is  insensitive  to  be  categorizing  convicted  persons  with  drug \noffenses.  I am a witness to police activity.  When the PRWORA was implicated in the \n1990s, if you were within five feet of someone who had drugs, you went to jail.  Before, \npossession was nine-tenths of the law.  If someone threw their drugs while running, all ten \npeople went to jail.  How to validate someone who was charged and had to go through the \ncourt system and is not aware or educated about how to seal their record or have the charges \nremoved, to have to carry that stigma of being arrested but yet later on in the court system it \nwas dismissed.  There are more people corrupt that are not convicted persons who easily, \nwithout question, take advantage and abuse these same benefits.  To target one specific \ngroup, when everyone's stomach growls, it is unethical and inhumane.  When other countries \nwithhold food, America goes right in and challenges and rises up against it, yet we are, in the \nstate of Nevada, withholding food.  There are people who do things for drugs and have never \nbeen arrested and yet they qualify.  There is no way of knowing who is abusing, but the \npercentage of abusers are higher of non-convicted people than those who are convicted.  \nWhat is the rate of food being stolen out of Walmart and Smith's and Albertsons?  People \nsteal food because they are hungry, and they have to provide. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWill you wrap up your comments?  We are at two minutes. \n \nAyanna Oglesby: \nWith that, I will say, we are Nevada strong, we are battle born, and we have a moral \nobligation to help our brothers and sisters. \n \nAshley White, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \nI am here in support of A.B. 138.  I believe that this would be a good bill to pass because it \nwould help many families in numerous ways.  One of the biggest struggles in this state and \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 24, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nworldwide is the lack of food and access to it.  Some people make bad decisions, but they \nshould not have to suffer and keep struggling.  Parents come home or are getting their \nchildren back and are working on restarting their homes.  They are trying to keep a stable and \nsafe home for their children that still would allow them to help feed their families.  Many \nindividuals are struggling especially in times like what we are dealing with currently with \nCOVID-19 and getting a job.  With no job or other income to purchase food to feed their \nfamilies, they starve and struggle.  This can possibly cause mental issues to restart and send \nthem back down the same path they are working to correct.  Instead of continuing this \nvicious cycle, let us make the change to support them and help one less stress and worry and \nkeep them from starving.   \n \nI know personally, if I did not have the benefit monthly of SNAP, my family would be \nstarving, so I understand the importance of those benefits.  I have seen this happen with \nnumerous people that were incarcerated and had this problem.  If they had this help and \nsecurity, success would have been much easier for them and their families.  My uncle ran \ninto this problem after his drug conviction.  He was rehabilitated during his incarceration, but \nthey did not have records, so he was denied SNAP and did not have access to food.  He \nended up in the hospital as a diabetic almost in a coma.  We almost lost him.  If he had that \naccess available, that would never have happened.  I do support A.B. 138.   \n \nBenjamin Challinor, Policy Director, Faith in Action Nevada: \nWe are a statewide, nonpartisan, multifaith organization that organizes and advocates for \nracial, social, and economic justice as well as inclusive democracy.  We are 100 percent in \nsupport of A.B. 138 with the proposed amendment.  We want to thank Assemblywoman \nMartinez for bringing this bill to the Committee.  We echo the sentiments of the previous \nspeakers.  We must always strive to help those who are needy.  Nevada has never fully \nrecovered from the 2008 recession due to the continued high number of Nevadans who \nare experiencing food insecurity.  As we are currently in another economic crisis due to \nCOVID-19, we are seeing more and more Nevadans needing public assistance.  The bill \nremoves unneeded barriers, barriers that are disproportionately affecting communities of \ncolor.  This bill works towards helping those who are most in need. \n \nEdward Coleman, Chair, Nevada Democratic Black Caucus: \nI am speaking in support of A.B. 138.  The process of reentry is a significant issue facing our \ncorrectional system.  According to research, LaCrosse, et.al. noted in the U.S., approximately \n600,000 individuals are released from prison each year.  Within three years of their release \napproximately two-thirds are rearrested, and three-fourths are rearrested within five years.  \nThis research indicated that the first year after release is critical, for 50 percent are rearrested \ndue to lack of support.  They noted barriers these individuals faced after being released \nimpact their success at reintegrating back into society.  Barriers to reentry such as not \nreceiving proper social, economic, and mental health and substance abuse support negatively \nimpacted individuals' ability to reenter society, and these stresses were particularly acute in \nthe first year after being released.   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 24, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nOur prison system is punitive and focuses on containment and control of individuals instead \nof providing routes to rehabilitation.  In her research, Niela Esperanza Flores noted there are \nsocioeconomic  factors  which  affect  recidivism.    Specifically,  she  linked  a  lack  of \nsocioeconomic support and access to opportunities to improve their lives outside of prison as \nfactors affecting recidivism. \n \nFlores stated many are released only to find that they do not have the necessary support, \nresources, or financial means to be able to survive out in the real world.  Lack of access \nto ways to support themselves after prison makes an individual more likely to resort to crime \nto have their needs met.  Our prison system is punitive and lacks the socioeconomic support \nfor certain convicted persons outside of prison.  This increases the chances they will reoffend \nto  feed  and  shelter  themselves.    Some  may  argue  that  prison  itself  is  enough  to  deter \nrecidivism.  Jennifer E. Copp explored it in her research and stated that the deterrence effect \nof a prison-only system does not account for the socioeconomic realities that people face on \nrelease.  Put another way, prison alone cannot reduce recidivism rates, and to be effective, \nthere must be strong socioeconomic support for individuals who are released.  While some \nmay argue that an individual's behavior or characteristic dictates recidivism, the Prison \nPolicy Institute has noted that the strongest predictor for recidivism is poverty—a lack of \naccess to resources. \n \nAccording  to  the  Nevada  Department  of  Corrections,  the  three-year  recidivism  rate  in \nNevada is 28.63 percent.  Due to injustices in the justice and social systems of the state, \nBlack people are approximately 8 percent of the state's population but account for 29 percent \nof those incarcerated.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nExcuse me, can I get you to wrap up your comments. \n \nEdward Coleman: \nLife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness:  In 2019, the voting rights of approximately \n77,000 felons were restored.  These individuals have been given liberty and in a small way \n[allotted time was exceeded]. \n \nJim Hoffman, representing Nevada Attorneys for Criminal Justice: \nWe are here in support of this bill because it is positive for our clients for all the reasons you \nhave already heard.  Rather than repeat what they said, I will share a personal anecdote.  \nWhen I was a kid, my family was on food stamps.  It is very difficult being hungry—on \na physiological level.  If you do not get enough to eat, that is all you can think about.  You \ncan only concentrate on getting enough to eat, and it is hard to concentrate on other things.  \nFor people who have gotten out of prison, who have gotten off of drugs, who are trying to put \ntheir lives back together and maintain their stability, it is really hard when you cannot \nconcentrate.  That makes it harder for them to stay on the straight and narrow path, and that is \nsomething we want as a society.  In order to support that policy, I think it makes the most \nsense to let these people have food stamps.   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 24, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nNicole Williams, Private Citizen, Dayton, Nevada: \nI  am  in  full  support  of  A.B.  138.    All  humans,  all  Nevadans,  with  or  without  felony \nconvictions, should have access to food.  It is basic human decency to ensure nobody goes \nhungry.  Convicted felons already struggle with reentry to society, and not having to worry \nabout food is one less obstacle. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there more callers in support?  [There were none.]  We are at 27 minutes of testimony in \ntotal support, so I will open the lines for 28 minutes of testimony in opposition.  [There was \nno one to speak in opposition.]  With that, we will go to testimony in neutral, and I will allow \nthe same amount of time for neutral testimony as well. \n \nLisa Swearingen: \nThe  Division  would  like  to  thank  Assemblywoman  Martinez  and  Shane  Piccinini  for \nbringing this bill with the amended language forward.  We look forward to working with the \nbill's sponsors in addressing any additional questions or concerns that might arise. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo you have any closing remarks, Assemblywoman Martinez? \n \nAssemblywoman Martinez: \nI want to reiterate that A.B. 138 will allow people, regardless of past drug convictions, to \napply for these critical public assistance programs.  We are currently living in unprecedented \ntimes with COVID-19.  This bill will help so many Nevadans, and that is what we are here \nfor—to help families.  I urge you to support A.B. 138, and I thank the Committee, Shane \nPiccinini, and all the callers who called in support. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 138. \n \n[Exhibit G, Exhibit H, Exhibit I, Exhibit J, and Exhibit K were submitted but not discussed \nand will become part of the record.] \n \nI will now begin with public comment.  [The Chair reiterated Committee rules regarding \npublic comment.]  Is there anyone on the line for public comment?   \n \nJodi Hocking: \nI want to let you know that someone who registered has been trying to give testimony on the \nsupport side.  The last three digits of her number are 099.  She is in the waiting room, but she \nhas not been called, and she keeps trying to get in.   \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 24, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIs there anyone in the waiting room with those last three digits of her phone number?  \n[Someone was in the room who had not raised her hand and was unable to unmute.] \n \nI suggest that the person who was on the call put their comments in writing.  Support \ntestimony can be submitted within 48 hours after the close of the meeting.  Additionally, \nI know there are some tutorials.  I worked through the tutorial, as a lot of Assembly members \ndid, to see how it worked to get on those calls.  If there are additional questions, I would \nencourage that caller to reach out to my office directly, and maybe we can troubleshoot some \nof the problems concerning why the individual could not be heard today over the phone.  Is \nanyone else on the line for public comment?  [There was no one.] \n \nThat concludes our meeting for today.  Are there any comments from Committee members?  \n[There was no response.]  Our next meeting will be on Monday, March 1.  Keep in mind that \nwe will likely be having a work session on several bills we have heard over the last couple of \nweeks.

(BDR 38-193) \n \nSENATOR JAMES A. SETTELMEYER (Senatorial District No. 17): \nSenate Bill No. 446 of the 80th Session was brought before us and passed out \nof committee but lost on the Senate Floor. This bill has two aspects. One is the \nconcept of self-managed care, the other will be presented by Senator Hardy, \ndealing with Medicaid termination for those incarcerated. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 16, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nThis bill came about as I saw my friend Ted Nagel on the street, at night, in his \nwheelchair headed for the hospital. As I spoke with him, I found out he was \nunable to find individuals to care for him at his home at the rate made available \nto them. This bill would allow Mr. Nagel to be in charge of his own care, called \nself-managed care, as he has the wherewithal to do this. Self-managed care is \nnot for everyone but for those who have the mental faculties to manage their \nown care, giving them the opportunity to have those resources available at a \nhigher level. \n \nThis would give those individuals making $10 an hour the ability to make up to \nthe  federal  rate  offering  which  is  $25  to  $27.  The  personal  managed  care \nconcept, after being reduced as it is within federal law, would give them the \nability  to  be  paid,  perhaps,  $17  to  $21.  With  that  wage,  you  could  find \nindividuals in today’s market willing to work, doing what is necessary to care \nfor our disabled. \n \nTED NAGEL: \nI support S.B. 93. This bill is important to my physical well-being and human \nright to earn a living and enjoy life. During the last campaign cycle, many of the \ncandidates  across  the  levels  of  government  made  points  about  the  Nation \ngreatly lacking in personal caregivers. Several referred to it as a pandemic unto \nitself, most attributing it to low wages.  \n \nI was born with a physical disability called Arthrogryposis. Although I am not \nparalyzed  and  have  full  feeling,  my  physical  abilities  fit  the  description  of \nsomeone who is paralyzed. I rely on the assistance of others to help me out of \nbed, bathe, groom, prepare meals, etc. Without any or all of these basic needs \ntaken care of, I would remain in bed unable to do anything for myself.  \n \nWith these needs met, I am able to function in society and operate my own \nbusiness as a mobile DJ, entertaining for events such as weddings and funerals. \nI do marketing for several business which, until the pandemic, kept me busy. As \nI live in a rural area, it has been difficult to find caregivers willing to work for the \nmeager  pay  offered  through  the  Medicaid-funded  personal  care  program.  At \nbest, they would earn $10.50 an hour. For that amount of money, most people \nwould rather work at a fast-food establishment than take care of someone’s \npersonal hygiene. The few caregivers who do it well do not last working for \nagencies making this wage when they could be making $20 to $25 an hour \nworking under a private pay situation. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 16, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nDue to my wife’s own physical limitations, she is unable to provide the care I \nrequire. It became the practice of one care agency after another, as she lives in \nthe home, to not send anyone out to provide care any time the agency had a \nscheduling issue. As a result, on June 3, 2018, I resigned myself to check into \na long-term care facility until the issue was resolved. I expected this to be one, \nmaybe two months. Two months turned into 4 months, then a year, and to my \ndispleasure, I remained in the facility for 30 months.  \n \nI returned home on December 3, 2020, as the coronavirus hit the facility and \nten residents were diagnosed in one week with Covid-19. We were afraid I \nwould catch the virus and pass away. Until I can get back on the Medicaid \nprogram that once again will provide a caregiver, I am living at home under the \ncare of my wife who still has her physical limitations to deal with.  \n \nTo  make  things  work,  I  stay  in  bed  every  other  day  to  allow  my  wife  to \nrecuperate from helping me the day before. This is not a pleasant arrangement \nfor either of us, but one that is necessary. This situation is not conducive to me \nreturning to work, so we live solely on my monthly social security disability \npayments. It is interesting that spouses, or other immediate family members \nliving  in  the  home  providing  care,  cannot  be  reimbursed  through  Medicaid. \nThese family members may have given up their careers in order to take care of \ntheir family member.  \n \nI  want  you  to  understand  there  are  several  thousand  disabled  residents  in \nNevada with similar stories of difficulty finding caregivers due to low wages and \nlack of caregivers due to that low wage. As a member of the Nevada Disability \nPrevention  Action  Coalition,  I  want  to  represent  those  who,  in  the  past  or \ncurrently, suffer from lack of care.  \n \nSenate Bill 93, in part, provides an avenue for Nevada residents who have the \ncognitive ability to manage their own finances, to pay a reasonable salary from \nthe State directly to caregivers for their services up to the federally mandated \nmaximum. Until now, no one was able to subsidize their caregivers pay to make \nthe job more palatable and keep reasonable caregivers employed without getting \nkicked off of the program. We need to move forward to a society that opens as \nmany  opportunities  for  independence  as  possible.  It  took  many  years  for \ndisabled folks to “come out of the disability closet.” Many are trying to hold \ndown a job and rely on caregivers to make it out their front door to go to work. \nLet us make that situation one less thing for them to worry about. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 16, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nSENATOR SETTELMEYER: \nThe first section of S.B. 93 represents self-managed care. An individual such as \nMr. Nagel contacts an agency that takes a portion of the fund, and hires a \ncaregiver, which reduces the funds available for the caregiver to $10 to $12 an \nhour.  Sadly,  for  the  type  of  personal  care  Mr.  Nagel  and  most  individuals \nrequire, there are not many willing to work for that wage. \n \nThere have been discussions on what a minimum wage should be. Paying below \nthat number for these types of services makes it difficult to find caregivers. This \nwould allow Mr. Nagel to handle his own self-managed care and be reimbursed \nup to the federal fund amount to hire a caregiver. He would, in essence, become \nthat person hired through the agency. This is not for everyone. There are those \nwho do not have the wherewithal to do this such as Mr. Nagel does. Those that \ndo should be given the opportunity to manage their own personal care and hire \nassistance  accordingly,  using  up  to  the  federal  amount  allowed  to  pay \ncaregivers.  \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThis would allow an individual to supplement the caregiver’s wages with his or \nher own resources? \n \nSENATOR SETTELMEYER: \nIt would allow individuals, such as Mr. Nagel, to hire a caregiver and pay $50 an \nhour if they have the resources to afford the difference between their income \nand the federal rate. Right now, they are forbidden by law from paying anything \nover the federal rate. This bill would allow them the opportunity to hire someone \nat a higher rate and make up the difference themselves. \n \nSENATOR JOSEPH P. HARDY (Senatorial District No. 12): \nSection 3 of S.B. 93 represents Medicaid being terminated when an individual is \nincarcerated. If it were to be suspended, it would be easier for the individual to \nget  back  on  track  rather  than  if  it  were  terminated.  When  an  individual  is \nincarcerated, he or she loses Medicaid coverage because the State assumes \ncharge of the care of the individual, paying for medical services. Tradition is that \nunless there is a waiver, the State terminates Medicaid and the individual has to \nreapply when released from prison.  \n \nOne of the consistencies we find is it takes longer to have a new application for \nMedicaid  completed  than  to  reinstate  if  it  has  been  suspended.  When  an \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 16, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nindividual is released, that person is vulnerable, has medical issues, substance \nuse disorders, a longer wait to get approval for Medicaid to be reinstated and is \nat risk for recidivism. \n \nSection 3 of S.B. 93 allows the State to suspend Medicaid, thus reinstating it in \neffectiveness immediately upon release from prison. It is good for the prisoner \nand good for the State as we save money. It helps with the challenges of \nrecidivism, getting individuals safely back into society receiving the care they \nneed while eligible for Medicaid. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe Division of Welfare and Supportive Services has a pilot program running in \nour State correctional facilities to ensure individuals are enrolled in Medicaid \neffective  upon  release  from  prison.  What  is  the  state  of  play  for  when \nindividuals are in county jails awaiting adjudication? Are they in the same status \nas State inmates at this point, and would this bill also capture them? \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWhen in a halfway house, this waiver would be effective, so you would be \neligible for Medicaid; however, I will defer to the experts to confirm this. \n \nLISA  SWEARINGEN  (Chief,  Eligibility  and  Payments,  Division  of  Welfare  and \nSupportive Services, Department of Health and Human Services): \nWe are running a pilot project with a couple of institutions in Las Vegas. We are \nworking with enrolling these individuals as part of their prerelease package. We \nhelp the inmate fill out the application to assume a suspend status so we are \nnotified as soon as he or she is released and their cases made eligible. That \nprocess takes from 24 to 48 hours to complete as we have to run through a \nbatch process to the Medicaid agency. The inmate receives a Medicaid card \nupon release.  \n \nWe do not have anything in place at this time in the county jails for suspending \nthese individuals. We are looking at detention centers and recently signed a \ncontract with the Public Consulting Group to obtain incarceration information to \nget a better idea on when individuals become incarcerated so we can quickly \nget them benefits once they are released.  \n \nWe have a process in place with the Department of Corrections for applications \nsubmitted when individuals are incarcerated and leave the facility to go into the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 16, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nhospital. If they are in the hospital over 24 hours, we are able to take those bills \nand process them as a prior medical request, paying those bills under Medicaid. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe ability to create a suspended status would affect any Medicaid recipient, \nregardless of which level of custody in county jail or State custody? \n \nMS. SWEARINGEN: \nWe built a process in our system to suspend these individuals. It shows they are \nsuspended; however, it sends the ineligible version to Medicaid so there are no \ncapitation fees being charged to the State. The system allows us to reverse that \nsuspension and reinstate those cases. There would be no fiscal note attached. \n \nSARAH K. HAWKINS (Nevada Attorneys for Criminal Justice): \nI proposed an amendment to S.B. 93 (Exhibit B) that would have prohibited the \ntermination of Medicaid benefits for incarcerated individuals. As written, it is \ndiscretionary. I have been made aware of a significant fiscal note attached to \nthe amendment that imperils the bill, so I am withdrawing the amendment. \n \nSTEVEN COHEN: \nI support S.B. 93. \n \nDARIN BALAAM (Sheriff, Washoe County): \nThe Washoe County Sheriff’s Office supports S.B. 93, particularly section 3. \nSuspending Medicaid for incarcerated individuals, as opposed to terminating, \nwill improve continuity of care and outcomes for individuals we serve in our \ncorrection and detention facilities. \n \nSeveral years ago, the Washoe County Sheriff’s Office formed a partnership \nwith the State, allowing us to help inmates incarcerated within the Washoe \nCounty  Detention  Facility  apply  for  Medicaid  before  they  are  released.  Our \nDetention Services Unit pulls a weekly report for inmates scheduled for release \nwithin ten days. Inmates who have indicated they would like services or are \neligible for Medicaid are screened and provided with applications; they fill those \nout, and we forward them on to the State office.  \n \nAbout  6  to  15  Medicaid  and/or  Supplemental  Nutrition  Assistance  Program \n(SNAP) applications a day are being sent from our office to the Division of \nWelfare  and  Supportive  Services.  This  shows  how  many  inmates  in  our \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 16, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nDetention Facility in Washoe County need Medicaid or SNAP. Because of our \npartnership with the State, we are able to notify these agencies two days prior \nto an inmate’s release. At that point, applications are processed so by the time \nthe inmate is released from our facility, Medicaid has been reinstated.  \n \nFor the many we serve, the program and services they want or need require \ninsurance.  The  Washoe  County  Sheriff’s  Office  believes  the  responsibility  is \nincumbent  upon  us  to  help  inmates  with  services  in  an  effort  to  reduce \nrecidivism and get them on the road to recovery. The level of inmates requiring \nmental  health  service,  whether  for  addiction  or  mental  illness,  continually \nincreases. Providing Medicaid prior to release helps them keep continuity of care \nupon release. Once they are released and not able to have Medicaid reinstated, \nwe  have  seen  them  turn  to  other  types  of  illegal  substances  to  medicate \nthemselves. This bill will help ensure the neediest among us will receive services \nthrough Medicaid or SNAP.  \n \nOur  Detention  Services  Unit  works  diligently  to  find  services  and  beds  for \ninmates prior to their release. This helps avoid delays in receiving Medicaid, \ntherefore avoiding delays in receiving care to make an impact on outcomes and \nrecidivism once released.  \n \nSERENA EVANS (Nevada Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual Violence): \nThe Nevada Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual Violence supports S.B. 93, \nparticularly section 3. We know many victim survivors are incarcerated for a \nmultitude of reasons, many of which are directly impacted because of their \nvictimization. For many survivors previously incarcerated, we consistently hear \nthey are not getting access to affordable health care. It is a challenge and can \nbe a barrier for overcoming previous victimization. We are in support of any \nmeasures ensuring incarcerated individuals and victim survivors have access to \naffordable healthcare upon their release so they can get back on track without \nhaving the burden of reapplying for eligibility in the Medicaid program. \n \nJOANNA JACOB (Clark County): \nClark County supports S.B. 93, particularly section 3. Last year, Clark County \nand our city colleagues took part in a working group on efforts to address \nhomelessness through the passage of A.B. No. 73 of the 80th Session. We had \nnumerous presentations from law enforcement and jails in southern Nevada that \ntalked  about  factors  driving  recidivism  which  had  to  do  with  the  concerns \nidentified by Sheriff Balaam in Washoe County. Access to medication, support, \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 16, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nhousing and linking people to a system of care as quickly as possible after \ndischarge  from  a  correctional  setting  is  important,  addressing  those  factors \ndriving recidivism. We believe the suspension, as opposed to termination of \nMedicaid, will help link those eligible into a system of care we know our State \nhas worked hard to develop. The Division of Welfare and Supportive Services \nhas  tried  to  partner  with  Clark  County  Detention  Center  to  bring  eligibility \nservices into a detention center.  \n \nCONNIE MCMULLEN (Personal Care Association of Nevada): \nThe Personal Care Association of Nevada stands neutral on S.B. 93. When the \nbill was initially presented, I thought most of what the bill sponsor wanted was \nalready in law. We are happy that section 2 is being clarified and placed into \nlaw. Some of our members are concerned for vulnerable people being placed in \na  situation  of  unlicensed  caregivers  and  the  attendant  oversight  of  those \ncaregivers. The fact that Mr. Nagel, who is able to live in his community in a \nless-restrictive setting, was forced to go into a nursing home was unnecessary. \nWe remain neutral but are not opposed. \n \nERIC SPRATLEY (Executive Director, Nevada Sheriffs’ and Chiefs’ Association): \nNevada Sheriffs’ and Chiefs’ Association supports S.B. 93. \n \nMS. HAWKINS: \nWe know there are fiscal benefits to S.B. 93 that promises to reduce recidivism. \nFor  my  clients,  once  individuals  are  stabilized  in  custody  on  mental  health \nmedication,  we  are  looking  for  continuity  of  care  that  keeps  them  on  their \nmedications, functioning well and being productive in the community with their \nfamilies. Too often, I see where the interruption in eligibility benefits causes a \nlapse in a person taking and having access to medication. I am in support of \nS.B. 93. \n \nJOHN  PIRO  (Deputy  Public  Defender,  Office  of  the  Public  Defender, \nClark County): \nOffices of the Clark and Washoe County Public Defenders support S.B. 93. \nSection 3 is the most important for continuity of care. There is nothing worse \nthan getting a mentally ill client in custody stabilized on the correct medications \nand then getting that person released without the proper medical coverage, \nincreasing the risk of recidivism.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 16, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 93. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRemainder of page intentionally left blank; signature page to follow.   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 16, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAs there is no public comment, this meeting is adjourned at 4:56 p.m. \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nVickie Polzien, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 16, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nExhibit  Begins \nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \nLetter  on Page \n  A  1    Agenda \nSarah K.

(BDR 38-6) \n \nSENATOR PAT SPEARMAN (Senatorial District 1): \nI am presenting S.B. 123 relating to the Nevada Silver Haired Legislative Forum. \nI will provide you with background information about the Forum (Exhibit B) and \nthe proposed conceptual amendments in this bill (Exhibit C). \n \nThe proposed changes to S.B. 123 expand the qualifications relating to the \nmembership of the Forum. Section 1 of the bill provides flexibility to appoint \nindividuals to the Forum by changing residency requirements from five years to \none year for all nominees or six months for nominees who are military members.\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 18, 2021 \nPage 2 \n \nSection 1 also reduces the residency requirement in the Senatorial District from \n3  years  to  30 days.  Section  2  of  the  bill  would  include  the  same  changes \nregarding ex officio members of the Forum. \n \nSenate Bill 123 came about because I wanted to nominate a person to the \nNevada  Silver  Haired  Legislative  Forum.  The  person  had  over  30  years  of \nexperience in business and industry but had not been in Nevada for 3 years; she \nwas told she could not serve. I could not understand why those qualifications \nexisted. People who want to serve are over 60 years old, retired and want to \ngive back to their community. I do not understand why we make them wait \nfive years to qualify; it does not make sense. The residency requirements in the \nproposed amendments mirror those for offices in Nevada.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI have been involved with appointing people to the Forum for some time now. I \nfind institutional knowledge has advantages for Nevada and what our State is \ndoing. Losing institutional knowledge is bad. I wonder if the bill's sponsor would \nbe  interested  in  limiting  the  number  of  Forum  members  who  do  not  have \ninstitutional knowledge to no more than one-third under the six-month residency \nrequirement in the proposed amendment. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI am not sure I want to do that because we have people who are willing to \nserve. You can talk about institutional knowledge; however, I was not born here \nor did not grow up here. There are so many things I learned about Nevada while \nliving here, and it did not take five years. If you have another explanation, I may \nconsider it. I understand institutional knowledge, and maybe there are things we \ncan do to ensure the makeup of the Forum as members come and go. The same \nthing occurs in the Legislature with term limits. As Senators term out, there are \nnew Senators who come on board with no institutional knowledge and I think \nwe do well. I do not want to disqualify anyone who is otherwise qualified from \nserving. I am willing to consider changes, and we can talk about it. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nOur Senatorial Districts can be very different. Some are stable, where residents \nhave lived there for years; other districts have a high turnover rate of residency. \n   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 18, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nSomehow  naturally,  we  are  going  to  get  a  mix  of  people  and  diverse \nrepresentation because we have a diversity of districts within our State. \n \nThe hearing on S.B. 123 is now closed.

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic and for the safety of our \nstaff, legislators, and the public, the building is currently closed for any physical \nattendance. We have worked hard to ensure there are various opportunities for \nthe public to participate with our Committee and be sure we get their input.  \n \nAll committee information is available on the Nevada Legislature Website, the \nNevada Electronic Legislative Information System (NELIS). There is also a Help \nlink that provides information on how to participate in the meetings by either \ntestifying,  submitting  written  testimony  or  exhibits,  sharing  your  opinion \nthrough the application on NELIS, and watching the meetings either through the \nWebsite or on the YouTube channel. \n \nI will entertain a motion to adopt the Senate Committee on Health and Human \nServices Rules for the 2021 Session (Exhibit B).  \n \nSENATOR HARDY MOVED TO ADOPT THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON \nHEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES RULES FOR THE 2021 SESSION AS \nSUBMITTED. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \n  THE  MOTION  CARRIED.  (SENATOR  SPEARMAN  WAS  EXCUSED  FOR \nTHE VOTE.) \n \n* * * * * \n \nI want to note for the public and members of this Committee; typically, we have \nabout two weeks of introductory presentations from the Department of Health \nand Human Services (DHHS) to establish a baseline understanding about DHHS \nand its divisions. Given that we have a relatively tenured Committee, we will \nnot  do  those  basic  agency  presentations  in  this  Committee.  The  Assembly \nCommittee on Health and Human Services, which does have new members, will \nbe hearing those presentations. If the public or a member of this Committee \nwish  to  view  those  presentations,  they  can  watch  them  at  the  Assembly \nCommittee on Health and Human Services meetings. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 4, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nThe only presentation before this Committee is the Cannabis Compliance Board \nbecause we are new to this area. \n \nTYLER KLIMAS (Executive Director, Nevada Cannabis Compliance Board): \nI will provide an overview of the Nevada Cannabis Compliance Board (CCB). My \ntestimony will address how this agency has operated over the past 12 months. I \nwill read from my written testimony, (Exhibit C) pages 1 through 3. \n \nI will now present, the Nevada Cannabis Compliance Board Agency Overview \n(Exhibit D) on slides 1 through 19. I will be reading from my written testimony, \nExhibit C, pages 3 through 9. \n \nLast  Session,  there  was  considerable  discussion  on  cannabis  consumption \nlounges contained in A.B. No. 533 of the 80th Session. The CCB was required \nto submit a report on these lounges to the Legislature by January 1, 2021.  I \nincluded that report as supplemental material for the Committee, the Study on \nNevada Cannabis Consumption Lounges (Exhibit E). \n \nI can answer any questions and then will move on to Senate Bill (S.B.) 49. \n \nSENATE BILL 49: Revises provisions relating to cannabis. (BDR 56-268) \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI had misgivings about the Cannabis Compliance Board, but I have been very \nimpressed with Mr. Klimas's presentation and appreciate the work the CCB has \ndone. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe will now open the hearing on S.B. 49. \n \nMR. KLIMAS: \nThe CCB is presenting S.B. 49, which is our only bill this Session. It is primarily \nhousekeeping  and  clarifying  language  and  includes  the  CCB  proposed \namendment (Exhibit F). My staff will give a presentation on S.B. 49 (Exhibit G). \n  \nMICHAEL MILES (Deputy Director, Nevada Cannabis Compliance Board): \nI will be discussing section 1 of S.B. 49 that requests the removal of Nevada \nRevised Statute (NRS) 678A.530, subsection 2, which addresses depositions as \n   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 4, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nset out on page 3 of Exhibit G. My written testimony begins on page 9 through \npage 10 of Exhibit C. I will also be discussing the proposed CCB amendment to \nS.B. 49, Exhibit F. \n \nDAVID  STALEY  (Chief  Compliance/Audit  Investigator,  Nevada  Cannabis \nCompliance Board): \nI will be discussing section 2 of S.B. 49 that requests additional language be \nincluded in NRS 678B.340 as set out in Exhibit G, page 4. My written testimony \nis on page 10 of Exhibit C. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI am not sure what this does with regard to the 5 percent rule.  Does it allow \npeople to potentially get out of being identified as an owner, volunteer or under \na contract as it pertains to less than 5 percent ownership? What are you looking \nto do that is new and different than before? \n \nMR. STALEY: \nThe request for additional language does not provide for anything new. We felt \nthere  could  be  potential  confusion  because  the  language  provided  in \nNRS 678B.340 was used by the CCB to craft the waiver regulations we have in \nplace.  We  are  moving  that  language  from  NRS  678A.450,  duplicating  and \nputting  it  in  NRS  678B.340  to  clarify  the  CCB  has  the  opportunity  to \npromulgate  regulations  that  provide  the  ability  to  waive  the  requirement  for \nagent cards for individuals with less than 5 percent ownership.  \n \nThe NRS provides that anyone with ownership interest and that could include \none  single  share  of  a  company  or  1  percent  of  ownership,  our  regulations \nrequire a background investigation. They receive an agent card registering them \nwith the CCB for their ownership of the company. Most companies have four or \nfive different owners. It is not a burdensome process for us or the industry to \nconduct the background investigation on all those individuals. \n \nThe various publicly traded companies and some of the private companies have \nmany investors who have no control or involvement in the operations of the \ncannabis establishment. For instance, we have closely held private companies \nwherein one of the owners gave his or her share to someone in the family. That \nperson has no involvement in the running of the cannabis establishment. The \nCovid-19 issues make it difficult for anyone to get their fingerprints taken or \nhave a background check performed.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 4, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nFollowing the gaming model, one of the premises we have identified is the \nconcept  of  controls  being  important  with  all  of  our  different  cannabis \nestablishments and licensees. If a company initially requests a waiver according \nto Nevada Cannabis Compliance Regulations (NCCR) 5.112 or NCCR 5.125 and \nprovides information it has less than 5 percent shareholders and is not involved \nin control or operation of the company, it gives CCB leeway to allow those \nindividuals not to go through the agent card process. \n \nFor  a  publicly  traded  company  that  has  thousands  of  shareholders,  such  a \nrequirement is onerous and restricts the ability of that company to have its \nshares traded on a daily basis. Without the waiver, someone who wanted to \nbuy ten shares of that company today and sell them tomorrow would not be \nable  to  because  our  regulations  would  normally  require  their  licensure.  The \nproposed language does not eliminate our regulations that require individuals in \na control position who have shares or even no shares to file an application for a \ncannabis  executive  card.  A  chief  executive  officer,  chief  financial  officer, \nchairman of the board of directors, or any other individual who can exercise \ncontrol in the company's operations or participate in the profits of a marijuana \ncompany, are required to be found suitable and obtain an executive agent card \neven if they have no ownership in the company.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY:  \nWhat waivers exist now and what are the changes? \n \nMR. STALEY: \nThe waivers already exist under NCCR 5.112 and 5.125 and were promulgated \nbased on the ability provided to the CCB under NRS 678A.450. We are not \nadding any new regulations  or anything new to the statute. We are simply \nduplicating the language already in statute and  moving it to areas where it \nclarifies any questions there may be under NRS 678B.340. We already have the \nwaivers in place that were approved by the CCB at its July 21, 2020 meeting. \nThe CCB has approved waivers both for individuals on closely held companies \nand larger numbers of shareholders for publicly traded companies.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWhat will happen to the individual family member who was given one share? \n  \n   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 4, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nMR. STALEY: \nNothing will happen unless the company first applies for a waiver. The individual \nwe discussed is required to submit fingerprints and go through our background \ninvestigation to get an agent card even though he or she has never been to the \ncultivation production site. If a company submits an application for a waiver \nunder NCCR 5.112 or NCCR 5.125 and is able to provide sufficient evidence \nthat a shareholder has no involvement or control over the operations of the \ncannabis establishment, the CCB can approve the waiver. The individual then \ndoes not need to get an agent card or submit fingerprints for a background \ninvestigation because the individual has no ability to influence the operations of \nthe  cannabis  establishment.  We  look  closely  at  the  concept  of  control  and \nability for someone to be involved in control that would not be suitable under \nthe requirements of our regulations and statutes. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIf an individual had a 1 percent ownership and that individual's family members \nequally had 1 percent, this regulation would allow each one of them not to be \nfingerprinted  or  investigated.  By  the  time  each  of  them  had  1  percent \ncollectively, they would have a controlling interest and would have control. \n \nMR. STALEY: \nYour  question  provides  evidence  of  control.  We  would  look  at  familial \nownership, ownership from a spouse or through a family, as just mentioned. If \nthe amount of ownership indicated they could exercise a certain amount of \ncontrol over the operations, then the CCB would likely determine such a waiver \nwas  not  appropriate.  Through  ongoing  audits  and  investigations  performed \nduring a transfer of interest, our investigators and agents are looking for hidden \nownership or people who may be exerting control that do not have an agent \ncard. I would expect anyone exerting any significant control over the operations \nof a company, and both exist within the statutes and regulations, to call them \nforward at the CCB's discretion even if a waiver is in place. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nHave you already come across this situation? \n \nMR. STALEY: \nNo, we have not. The CCB has approved seven or eight waivers at this point. In \nall  cases,  the  companies  provided  us  with  information  indicating  either  the \nindividual or group of individuals they were waiving did not have an element of \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 4, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \ncontrol over the company. The agent's independent review of company records \nincludes  asking  the  company  to  provide  further  information,  including \ndisclosures  included  in  their  audited  financial  statements  with  the  Canadian \nSecurities  Exchange  (CSE)  or  the  U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission \n(SEC). The agents tested the attestations of the licensee and were able to find it \ndid not appear any of the individuals that would be affected by that waiver \nwould have any level of control which would have necessitated an agent card. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIf you depend on the company to tell you things and you investigate based on \nwhat they tell you, what are the consequences if the company lies to you, and \nthey did have some control? \n \nMR. STALEY: \nA  question  of  consequences  would  go  to  the  CCB  members,  who  are  the \nindividuals  that  make  those  decisions.  If  we  determined  that  there  were \nindividuals in a control position and had tried to circumvent our agent card \nrequirements, we would identify the circumstances. We would do a personal \ninterview  with  them  and  the  other  executives.  The  CCB  would  receive  the \ninformation  under  an  areas  of  concern  section  in  our  investigative  report  in \nwhich  we  would  lay  out  all  the  facts  that  were  ascertained.  It  would  not \nsurprise me where an individual exerted a level of control without submitting the \nagent  card  application.  What  would  surprise  me  is  if  they  did  so  with  the \nexpress intent to circumvent our requirements. I would initially expect it would \nbe  a  communication  problem  or  mistake;  however,  we  would  allow  the \ncompany an opportunity to address our areas of concern. If we were able to \ndetermine  it  was  done  specifically  to  circumvent  our  regulatory  structure, \nknowing the CCB, there would be a wide range of public and difficult penalties \nassessed against that company. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nCould the company then lose its license? \n \nMR. STALEY: \nYes. Our statutes provide that the CCB has a wide range of penalties it can \nassess against those companies, up to and including the revocation of their \nlicense. \n \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 4, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI understand this amendment is generally a clarification of language. What about \na publicly held corporation where a person technically has an ownership interest \nbecause they are a stockholder and do not have control. How do you decide if a \nlarge publicly held corporation has to have this kind of screening? \n \nMR. STALEY: \nPublicly traded companies, both in the CSE and SEC, have certain reporting \nrequirements. They have to make public disclosures annually, and individuals \nhave  to  make  disclosures  when  they  acquire  certain  levels  of  shares.  The \nstatutes  provide  an  under  5  percent  threshold  and  a  5  percent  and  over \nthreshold. According to regulation, the waivers we have adopted allow us to \nwaive the requirement that an under 5 percent individual may assess the waiver \nif they prove they are not in a control position. Anyone 5 percent or over is \nrequired to get a cannabis executive card and we do not have the ability to \nwaive that requirement for them. \n \nIn a large publicly traded company, a 5 percent position would be a significant \nposition and is uncommon. A 5 percent position may not give them control, in \nthe case of an institutional investor who may not want to disclose that it is for \ninvestment purposes only and will not be exerting any control. The 5 percent \nthreshold  has  been  determined  by  statute.  We  automatically  assume  that \nbecause  the  potential  of  a  controlling  or  influencing  position  exists  at  a \n5 percent threshold or above, any individual or company with an ownership of \n5 percent or above is required to get an agent card. The CCB can call that \ncompany forward if they conclude that it should be licensed like an owner or \nlicensure as an acquisition control. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIf I am in a retirement system that has a 5 percent ownership, how do you \nprovide me with a card? \n \nMR. STALEY: \nIn the case of a large institutional investor of investment funds or other entities \nthat  have  pooled  the  investment  ability  of  many,  none  of  the  individual \nshareholders or participants of the investments guaranteed by the fund have any \ncontrol of their investment or of the activities of the fund itself. In the case of a \nfund or investment company that operates a couple of different funds, they will \nhave  fund  managers  or  have  executives  identified  that  manage  or  run  the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 4, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \ninvesting activities of the company and are responsible for those investments. If \nthat is the case, they are identified by the company for us, and we require that \nthe fund or institutional investors provide us with an understanding of how \ndecisions  are  made  for  the  fund  and  the  individuals  that  can  make  those \ndecisions are required to have an agent card. \n \nThese concepts mirror the best practices of the Nevada Gaming Control Board. \nWhile our statutes and regulations are not as detailed or far reaching, it was \nimportant  that  we  look  to  the  premises  and  concepts  of  control  and  basic \npremises of regulations by the Board, take those best practices, and use them \nfor the cannabis industry. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAre you saying the practices mirror the gaming industry, but the statutory or \nregulatory framework does not? \n \nMR. STALEY: \nOur regulatory framework does mirror gaming though it is not as expansive. The \nBoard has separate regulations for limited liability companies, corporations and \npublicly traded companies. When we crafted our regulations pursuant to statute, \nwe did not lay out the specific delineations as the different types of companies. \nInstead,  we  went  to  the  core  concept  of  control  over  the  operations  of  a \ncannabis establishment. \n \nSTEVE  GILBERT  (Marijuana  Program  Manager,  Nevada  Cannabis  Compliance \nBoard): \nSection 3 of S.B. 49 cleans up language in NRS 678B.520 and helps address \nconsistent labeling of products as set forth on page 5 of Exhibit G. I will read \nfrom my written testimony on bottom of pages 10 and 11 of Exhibit C. \n  \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI have a question about existing stock and if it grandfathers in anything that has \nbeen produced within a certain time frame. How are you working through the \ntransition of existing labels? \n \nMR. GILBERT: \nWe are allowing the industry to work through the existing labels. We will be \nlooking at their time frame to work through those labels, whether the labels \nhave been approved and if the packaging must change. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 4, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDo you see that happening through a regulatory process where it is clear what \nthe cut-off date is for using those labels? \n \nMR. GILBERT: \nThat will be guidance that is given from the CCB to the industry.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIt seems like the CCB has more flexibility to get things done than perhaps some \nother agencies with whom we are accustomed to dealing. There might need to \nbe more clarity in either the NRS or the Nevada Administrative Code. Am I \nreading that wrong? \n \nMR. GILBERT: \nWe are in the process of looking at the regulations and potential upcoming \nworkshops to go over the packaging labels and guidelines. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nYou are basically on the record saying that if people have existing stock they \nwill be able to use that stock? \n \nMR. GILBERT: \nYes. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nBy removing the difference in labeling to medical cannabis and regular cannabis \nproducts, would this inhibit police enforcement's ability to know if someone has \na medical product even if they do not have a medical card? \n \nMR. GILBERT: \nNo, it would not. Cannabis is cultivated and labeled up to the point of sale. It is \nlabeled as a single source and that product is designated as medical at that \npoint of sale. If a person was questioned on the cannabis they have in their \npossession, they should have their medical marijuana registration card for that \npurpose. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 4, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nIn order for law enforcement to ask the individual to provide a medical card, \nhow would they be able to tell if the marijuana is medical grade? \n \nMR. GILBERT: \nIf the product was medical-grade level, possession limits for medical cannabis \nallowed is two and one-half ounces while possession for non-medical cannabis \nis a one-ounce purchase. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nAm I incorrect in assuming that there are some strains that are allowed to be \nsold as medical but not recreational? \n \nMR. GILBERT: \nYes. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI think clarity on this is essential so we have it on the record. All products that \ncontain cannabis can be used for either adult or medical use, but there are a \nsmall subsection of products that can only be used for medical use because of \nthe concentration within that product. Is that correct? \n \nMR. GILBERT: \nYes.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAre the higher concentration products only sold for medical use? The rest of it is \na matter of taxation; whether or not you pay the extra 10 percent? \n \nMR. GILBERT: \nThat is correct. \n \nMR. KLIMAS: \nI will go through the amendment, Exhibit F, which includes language to provide \nadditional flexibility to extend the 45-day requirement for the CCB to hold a \nhearing  after  a  licensee  answers  a  complaint.  In  some  cases,  especially  in \ncomplicated disciplinary matters, 45 days is not enough time for either side to \ngather the resources to hold an appropriate hearing. The aim will always be to \nmove expeditiously through these hearings and complaints. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 4, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nThis amendment allows for a request to be made to the CCB Chair for approval \nof an extension of the 45-day hearing requirement. Section 2 simplifies the \nprocess  for  serving  complaints  against  a  licensee.  The  way  the  statute  is \nwritten, the CCB has to vote blindly on approving service of a complaint that \nshould be a procedural matter. They do not get to see the complaint or know \nwho the complaint is filed against; they just know that the CCB and the Office \nof the Attorney General recommended that it be filed. It becomes an onerous \nprocess that is not a good use of staff or their time. The CCB Chair and board \nmembers made this point known at our first meeting. \n \nThis  amendment  allows  the  Executive  Director  of  the  CCB  to  serve  the \ncomplaint  and  does  not  change  any  part  of  the  process.  Section  3  of  the \namendment  allows  the  CCB  to  employ  additional  services  to  assist  in \ndisciplinary proceedings when necessary. This is a part-time Board that needs to \nutilize services of an administrative law judge in certain disciplinary matters. \nThis keeps the hearing process moving and is critical to allow for an appropriate \npace in its oversight responsibilities. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nI have a question about the extension of the 45-day hearing requirement. Can \nyou tell me about why you chose to give the CCB the ability to extend that \nindefinitely as opposed to giving yourselves more time? Instead of 45 days, why \nnot change it to 90 days or 120 days? \n \nMR. KLIMAS: \nThe goal is to always move quickly within the 45 days. We thought allowing \n90 to 120 days to the process would further delay the hearing. We have cases \ntwo years old we inherited. We want to keep the hearings on a tight schedule. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nWould you be willing to consider putting constraints on the CCB so people \nknow they have the right to have their cases heard within a certain time period. \nIf extensions can be continually granted, then it will never be known how long it \nmight take and there is no further guarantee. The 45 days becomes irrelevant. \n \nMR. KLIMAS: \nI understand what you are saying and we can look into adding some guidelines. \nIf someone applies for an extension, and the Chair grants a certain amount of \ntime, the option would be to continually grant an extension. I do not think that \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 4, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nwould be the intent and would not work out well for the CCB, staff or licensee. \nI would hope that practice would not be common. I can tell you that I, as Chair, \nwould not make it a common practice. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe are going to want to get clarity on this issue. The CCB or staff would not \nrequest an extension, the request for an extension would only come from the \npetitioners, correct? \n \nMR. KLIMAS: \nThe  request  for  an  extension  would  come  from  either  our  deputy  attorney \ngenerals or the licensee. \n \nMARLA MCDADE WILLIAMS (Strategy 360): \nI will read from my written testimony in opposition to S.B. 49, (Exhibit H). \n \nSTEVEN COHEN: \nI  am  testifying  neutral  to  S.B.  49.  The  issue  of  jurisdictions  in  legalizing \ncannabis,  while  being  federally  illegal,  creates  a  policy  concern  when  State \nagencies are primarily federally funded. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will now close the hearing on S.B. 49. \n \nMONA LISA SAMUELSON: \nI represent medical cannabis patients living in Nevada and we want you to know \nthat medical patients are very pleased the issue of cannabis has moved from the \nJudiciary Committee to the Health and Human Services Committee. \n \n \n   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 4, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe Senate Committee on Health and  Human Services Committee Brief has \nbeen submitted (Exhibit I). \n \nThis meeting is adjourned at 5:04 p.m. \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n   \nNorma Mallett, \nCommittee Secretary \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \nDATE:   \n   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 4, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nExhibit  Begins \nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \nLetter  on Page \n  A  1    Agenda \n  B  1  Senator Julia Ratti  Committee Rules \nTyler Klimas / Nevada \n  C  1  Cannabis Compliance  Written Testimony \nBoard \nMichael Miles / Nevada \n  C  9  Cannabis Compliance  Written Testimony \nBoard \nDavid Staley / Nevada \n  C  10  Cannabis Compliance  Written Testimony \nBoard \nSteve Gilbert / Nevada \n  C  10  Cannabis Compliance  Written Testimony \nBoard \nTyler Klimas / Nevada \n  D  1  Cannabis Compliance  Board Agency Overview \nBoard \n  Tyler Klimas / Nevada \nStudy on Nevada Cannabis \n  E  1  Cannabis Compliance \nConsumption Lounges \n  Board \nTyler Klimas / Nevada \nS.B. 49  F  1  Cannabis Compliance  Proposed Amendment \nBoard \nMichael Miles / Nevada \nS.B. 49  F  1  Cannabis Compliance  Proposed Amendment \nBoard \nMichael Miles / Nevada \nS.B. 49  G  1  Cannabis Compliance  Presentation on S.B. 49 \nBoard \nDavid Staley / Nevada \nS.B. 49  G  4  Cannabis Compliance  Presentation on S.B. 49 \nBoard \nS.B. 49  G  5  Steve Gilbert / Nevada  Presentation on S.B. 49 \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 4, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nCannabis Compliance \nBoard \nTyler Klimas / Nevada \nS.B. 49  G  6  Cannabis Compliance  Presentation on S.B. 49 \nBoard \nMarla McDade Williams \nS.B. 49  H  1  Written Testimony \n/ Strategies 360 \n  I  1  Senator Julia Ratti  Committee Brief \n ", "\nMINUTES OF THE  \nSENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n \nEighty-first Session \nFebruary 9, 2021 \n \n \nThe Senate Committee on Health and Human Services was called to order by \nChair Julia Ratti at 3:34 p.m. on Tuesday, February 9, 2021, Online.

(BDR 39-431) \n \nDOROTHY EDWARDS (Behavioral Health Coordinator, Washoe Regional Behavioral \nHealth Policy Board, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, Department \nof Health and Human Services): \nI will read from my written testimony (Exhibit B). \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 9, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nCHAIR RATTI:  \nThere are four one-page summaries with helpful information on each of the bill \ncomponents  submitted  as  exhibits  by  Washoe  Regional  Behavioral  Health \n(Exhibit C, Exhibit D, Exhibit E and Exhibit F). \n \nSEAN O’DONNELL (Executive Director, Foundation for Recovery): \nI will read from my written presentation (Exhibit G) to present S.B. 69. \n \nNATALIE POWELL (Director, Nevada Certification Board): \nI will provide a brief history of the Nevada Certification Board (NCB) (Exhibit H) \nand read from my written presentation (Exhibit I). \n \nStates  may  maintain  up  to  two  International  Certification  & Reciprocity \nConsortium  (IC&RC)  Boards  if  needed.  These  boards  can  license  or  certify \nbehavioral health service providers in prevention, treatment and recovery.  \n \nThe NCB was granted permission to apply to IC&RC by the State Board of \nExaminers for drug, alcohol and gambling counselors. In 2016, we received \npermission to be a secondary board and were accepted into the IC&RC.  \n \nOur  task  was  to  provide  a  voluntary  certification  process  for  peer  recovery \nsupport and prevention specialists that would meet or exceed IC&RC standards.  \n \nIn 2018, the NCB was asked by the Division of Public and Behavioral Health to \nprovide a similar voluntary certification process for community health workers. \nWe now provide voluntary certification for three occupations in community and \nbehavioral health.  \n \nIn terms  of our mission, vision and the importance of certification, refer to \nExhibit I for contact information and links to the NCB and IC&RC websites. \n \nIn 2017, we held an IC&RC-endorsed pilot or grandfathering period for our peer \nspecialist  certification  process.  The  purpose  of  the  pilot  was  to  allow \ncertification for peer specialists already working in the field and well established, \nand work out any issues in our certification process.  \n \nDuring the pilot period, we certified 59 peer recovery and support specialists. \nSince this pilot, we have certified an additional 91 peers, making a total of \n150 specialists working in the State. Additionally, we have 242 peers who have \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 9, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nstarted the application process with the NCB. The application process can take \nup to a year to complete. Applications consist of proof of a high school diploma \nor  equivalency,  and  a  minimum  of  46  hours  of  State-approved  specialized \ntraining in IC&RC peer domains. \n  \nOur two State-approved training organizations are Foundation for Recovery and \nthe  Center  for  the  Application  of  Substance  Abuse  Technologies,  at  the \nUniversity of Nevada, Reno.  \n \nAlso required are 500 hours of supervised experience in those peer domains and \npassing the IC&RC peer recovery examination. To be a certified peer recovery \nspecialist,  you  need  lived  experience  in  substance  abuse,  mental  health  or \nprocess addiction, along with a required minimum of two years in recovery. We \nwant people to be stable so they can help others. The IC&RC peer domains \nrequire demonstration in proficiency and include advocacy, ethical responsibility, \nmentoring in education and recovery and wellness support. \n \nLINDA LANG (Director, Nevada Statewide Coalition Partnership): \nI will read from written testimony (Exhibit J). \n \nCHAIR RATTI:  \nThere is a proposed conceptual amendment to S.B. 69 (Exhibit K) under my \nname. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nMr.  O’Donnell,  is  there  a  section  that  pertains  to  applicability  related  to \ncompensation, such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) sponsors? \n \nMR. O’DONNELL: \nWhat  I  presented  included  the  conceptual  amendment  which  made  the \nclarification that certification would apply to those using those titles or those \ncompensated to provide these services.  \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nAre these services billable under Medicaid or commercial insurance, and is State \nMedicaid billing for them now?  \n \nMR. O’DONNELL: \nYes. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 9, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIs certification a qualification for billing services? If one is not certified, can they \nbill for services? \n \nMR. O’DONNELL: \nTo my knowledge, certification is not required to bill for services. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nMs.  Powell,  is  a  high  school  diploma  or  equivalency  required  to  become \ncertified? \n \nMS. POWELL: \nA high school diploma or equivalency is required for each of our certifications.  \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nAs this is specifically outlined as nonclinical and lived experience, why should \nthat be a requirement and possible barrier? \n \nMS. POWELL: \nIt is a requirement of the IC&RC and an international requirement we subscribe \nto. We wanted to standardize the process and are happy to help with the GED \nprocess if that is a barrier.  \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nMs. Lang, is the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) individually \nidentifiable or aggregated? \n \nMS. LANG: \nNo, that is the reason for the minimum required response rate of 60 percent. \nExhibit F shows the response rates across the various counties and how close \nwe are to not reaching that 60 percent. We cannot go through individual school \ndistricts much lower than 60 percent before the data can be identified. The \nschool districts that participate can receive this data and use it as they wish. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nOn an aggregated basis, not with the individual identifiable information, correct? \n \nMS. LANG: \nCorrect, no individual information. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 9, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nMs. Powell, why is lived experience important? \n \nMR. O’DONNELL: \nLived experience for peer recovery support specialists is the crux of what makes \nthese services work. I have training in learned experience of confidentiality, \ntools for  motivational interviewing, advocacy and mentorship.  This could be \nlearned in a class setting; however, as a peer recovery support specialist with \nlived  experience  in  incarceration  or  homelessness,  one  could  relate  to  an \nindividual removing the power differential. A peer recovery support specialist is \nseen as a peer having had similar life experiences who can help to navigate \nsystems  and  rebuild  a  life  relating  to  one  another  because  of  those  lived \nexperiences. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nCultural competency was a topic discussed last Session. Speaking with people \nwho understand where you are and what you have been through and the power \ndifferential, there would be no judgement, correct? \n \nMR. O’DONNELL: \nYes. A great example of that is the concept of matching someone in need of \nhelp with someone experiencing similar circumstances. If someone is seeking \npeer  recovery  support,  you  would  attempt  to  match  them  with  a  specialist \nbased  on  those  same  experiences.  As  a  member  of  the  LGBTQ  community \nmyself, it may be more beneficial to work directly with other members of that \ncommunity as they are able to relate with their experiences.  \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nIt  is  important  to  speak  with  someone  having  that  lived  experience  and \ncredibility within your community and have them represent those communities \npresent in Nevada. \n \nSenate Bill No. 204 of the 80th Session pertaining to suicide prevention had \nelements suggesting a nexus between what you are doing and what the school \nsystem  is  attempting.  Ms.  Lang,  I  would  like  to  speak  with  you  offline  to \ncollaborate to boost support for your program. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 9, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nMS. LANG: \nI would be happy to meet with you offline and will reach out to you. I am \nfamiliar with that bill and the report required. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nWe have had many suicides in Clark County, and we need to do better with \nthat. Some elements would be very helpful if implemented with what you are \nsuggesting.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \n“For the record, the bill would include peer experiences in behavioral health as \nmuch  as  substance  abuse  disorder.”  The  provisions  in  this  bill  around \nevidence-based prevention are based on S.B. No. 204 of the 80th Session. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI am unsure of the difference between the 46 hours versus the 500 hours of \nsupervised experience. Is tuition required for the 500 hours, and are applicants \nable to be peer recovery specialists while waiting for certification? What is the \nprocess for certification? \n \nMS. POWELL: \nThe 46 hours of instruction are classroom hours in advocacy, mentoring and \neducation,  recovery  and  wellness  support,  and  ethical  responsibility.  It  is \nweighted more heavily toward ethical responsibility. \n \nThe 500 hours are supervised experience working in the IC&RC peer domains. I \ncan provide the matrix of the tasks pertaining to these domains if necessary. \nThe IC&RC is a resource for us. They complete a job analysis of certifications \nand credentials every five to seven years. They have nationwide or international \nsubject matter experts researching this field and updating the examinations in \nkeeping with best evidence-based practices.  \n \nTraditionally, peers are eligible for hire by agencies prior to certification. We \nhave advisory committees for each certification made up of those in the field \nwho  are  subject  matter  experts.  Previously,  peers  felt  there  was  sufficient \nemployment available to have people perform these supervised hours before \nbecoming certified. As the proposed amendment, Exhibit K, shows, we will be \nproviding for the possibility of an internship. Interns could complete those hours \nby  either  volunteering  or  mentoring.  Many  agencies  will  pay  peers  for  this \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 9, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nexperience. We have not had any issue with peers finding paid or volunteer \npositions to accomplish those hours.  \n \nThere is a differentiation between an AA sponsor and a peer recovery support \nspecialist. We are not able to take peer experience working as a sponsor or with \nAA or Narcotics Anonymous (NA) group meetings and 12-step programs.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe concept of interns theoretically gives people a chance to pay tuition or have \nremuneration  while  working  toward  their  certifications  in  order  to  support \nthemselves during those 500 hours. With two years of sobriety and working in \nthe community, there is a step down in the level of living. An internship also \nprovides the possibility of an income. \n \nMS. POWELL: \nIn practice, that is happening. This peer recovery support specialist position is \nseen  as  the  beginning  of  a  clear  career  ladder.  Many  move  on  to  become \nlicensed counselors and social workers. It is an entry-level start, but they would \nbe making as much as peers in any position they previously or currently hold.  \n \nWe charge $165 to initially certify, $80 of which covers the test given by \nIC&RC, and the remaining goes to processing. Most peers have agencies that \nwill cover this cost. This certifies them for 2 years, and within that 2 years, the \nrenewal obligations are to complete 20 additional hours of continued education \nunits. Six of those hours must be in ethics to keep that in the forefront, and the \nremaining 14 hours are anything within the other IC&RC peer domains. The \nrenewal fee is $100. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWould  this  make  it  illegal  for  peers  to  work  in  the  community  without \ncertification? \n \nMS. POWELL: \nThere  is  a  grandfathering  period  giving  an  applicant  until  2023  to  become \ncertified as a recovering intern or a certified peer recovery support specialist. \nThere are allowances for those who volunteer, specifically for professionals who \nvolunteer as peers, such as lawyers providing legal advice. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 9, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nFor  individuals  practicing  as  peer  recovery  support  specialists  without  being \ncertified by 2023, there is no criminal penalty; there would be a civil penalty, \nand these people would be subject to a fine. If they continue to incur fines, they \ncould be held in contempt of court. At this point, that would be as far as it \nwould go. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIs there a fiscal note? \n \nMS. POWELL: \nThere is no fiscal note at this time, or it has been cleared. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThere have been many amendments to this bill. We will get information about \nthe two-thirds majority vote requirement and the fiscal note as we get closer to \nwork session. \n \n“For  the  record,  the  proposed  amendment  only  includes  those  who  will  be \ncompensated, and that is intentional to exclude AA, NA, any of the 12-step \ngroups and any other volunteer-driven groups supporting folks in recovery.” \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nHow do you know if someone is practicing and has not been certified? Is there \nanything in place to identify those continuing to practice without certification? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIt would be the same process as any other certification and licensing, mostly a \ncomplaint-driven process. \n \nNANCY BOWEN (CEO, Nevada Primary Care Association): \nThe Nevada Primary Care Association supports S.B. 69. Our members work is \naffected by at least two provisions in this bill: the sections dealing with peer \nsupport  specialists  and  the  YRBSS.  Healthcare  centers  have  been  working \ndiligently to expand substance abuse disorder services across the State. State \nand federal investments have encouraged the certification providers be able to \nadminister medication-assisted treatment to expand options for our community. \nPeer  support  specialists  have  benefited  by  the  programs  in  our  healthcare \ncenters.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 9, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nClarifying the definition, scope and responsibilities in Nevada Revised Statutes \n(NRS) will allow this provider type to further develop and produce results. Our \nmembers are reliant on federal grants to provide services to uninsured residents. \nBetween 2015 and 2020, we brought more than $188 million in grant funding \nto Nevada. Securing these grants required current and accurate data. One of the \nmost important data sources we use is the YRBSS. It is critical for Nevada to do \neverything necessary to support the collection of this data. \n \nDON GIBSON (Behavioral Health Peace Officer, Carson City Sheriff’s Office): \nI work full time with mental health clinicians and respond to all community crisis \ncalls  related  to  mental  health.  The  primary  focus  for  my  unit  is  jail  and \nemergency room diversion. My unit supports S.B. 69 and values the support of \nour community coalition, Partnership Carson City. Partnership Carson City is an \ninstrumental stakeholder for the health of our community and proven leader in \nraising  the  quality  of  life  for  individuals  who  suffer  from  mental  illness  and \nsubstance abuse.  \n \nRACHEL DUNFEE (Healthy Communities Coalition): \nI am an LGBTQ junior in Silver City and a Stand Tall prevention program team \nmember who supports S.B. 69. I have been involved with Healthy Communities \nCoalition  (HCC)  as  a  Stand  Tall  member  for  five  years  which  is  a  great \nopportunity for youths to get involved in their community. Stand Tall is a place \nwhere everyone is welcome no matter their past identity, sexual orientation or \nwalk of life. Stand Tall is a wonderful way to be educated on the dangers of \ntobacco, cannabis, e-cigarettes and alcohol in youth.  \n \nPrograms  such  as  Stand  Tall  create  an  open  conversation  for  youths  who \nstruggle with addiction. Diversity is important in these prevention groups as \neveryone has different experiences. We focus on prevention and touch on a \nvariety  of  subjects  from  prevention  to  mindfulness  and  exploring  artistic \nopportunities. This program not only teaches youths about prevention, it helps \nthem teach the rest of the community. Supporting coalitions means supporting \nthe worlds next generation, teaching us values to last a lifetime.  \n \nJOELLE GUTMAN DODSON (Washoe County Health District): \nWashoe County Health District supports S.B. 69. The implementation of peer \nrecovery support specialists in Washoe County is part of the Washoe County \nHealth District’s Community Health Improvement Plan. The certification for peer \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 9, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nrecovery support specialists will ensure a better standard of practice, elevate \nthe workforce, help protect the public and set the standard for employers.  \n \nThe Health District supports an up-to-date and evidence-based curriculum and \nprograms concerning substance misuse and abuse disorders in our schools. We \nare supportive of every school participating in the YRBSS. The more students \nparticipating in this survey, the more accurate data we have to address the \nneeds of Nevada’s youth. \n \nVINCE COLLINS (Director of Operations, The Gay and Lesbian Community Center \nof Southern Nevada): \nThe Gay and Lesbian Community Center of Southern Nevada supports S.B. 69. \nWe are initiating our first substance use and overdose data-to-action programs \nemploying a peer support specialist and need this expertise in launching our \nprogram. Having a baseline standard for peer support adds to our professional \nenvironment for navigating individuals with linkage to care and services. By \ndoing this, we impact the LGBTQ community and the greater community of \nLas Vegas. \n \nMALA WHEATLEY (Director, Pacific Behavioral Health): \nI support S.B. 69. Pacific Behavioral Health provides mental health services to \nrural counties throughout Nevada. Through our partnership with HCC, we have \nsuccessfully  collaborated  with  the  Lyon  County  School  District  to  provide \nmuch-needed, school-based mental health services to students. The Coalition \nhas provided vital communication, relationships and connections, allowing us to \nprovide  mental  health  services  to  our  youth.  The  successful  connections  of \nPacific  Behavioral  Health  with  Lyon  County  students  is  evidence  of  the \ncollaborative  efforts  of  the  HCC  and  serves  as  a  catalyst  for  community \nconnections. We have served over 100 students this year and were successful \nin stabilizing them in their homes and schools, due in part to these collaborative \nefforts. \n \nSUZANNE STROSSER: \nI  am  an  educator  at  Mission  High  School  in  Las  Vegas  which  is  the \nfirst publically funded recovery high school in the Nation. Mission High School \nprovides comprehensive education to students in recovery from substance use, \nabuse or dependency. We would use peer recovery support specialists to work \nthrough  responsible-thinking  processes,  productively  addressing  behaviors \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 9, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \ninterfering with those students’ education due to gaps in social and emotional \nlearning from early onset abuse. \n \nPeer support recovery specialists would address student concerns indicated in \ntheir weekly recovery check-ins and act as a mentors and models as students \nrecover.  These  relationships  are  beneficial  to  our  students  when  they  are \napprehensive  toward  obtaining  a  sponsor  during  their  recovery,  after  being \nadvised to avoid strangers. Baseline standards are necessary in providing this \nlow-barrier service with safe adults providing effective support to our students. \n \nERIN BEEN: \nI teach health at a high school in the Carson City School District, frequently \nusing local and State coalition provided tools needed to deliver evidence-based \nsubstance abuse prevention and mental health curriculum in my classes. I use \nthe  YRBSS  data  to  frame  evidence-based  curriculum  and  lessons  directly \nidentified by youth in the community.  \n \nCoalitions like Partnership Carson City are valuable to the community. I would \nlike  my  students  to  leave  my  class  with  content  knowledge,  skills  and \nresources. I have reached out to Partnership Carson City to plan lessons and \ncollaborate  in  developing  presentations  and  projects.  Together,  we  have \ndeveloped  youth  opportunities  after  school  in  the  community,  summer \nworkshops, evening programs and extended learning opportunities in relation to \nsubstance abuse prevention and mental health. I support S.B. 69. \n \nJOE JOANNE CULVER: \nI support S.B. 69 and will read from my written testimony (Exhibit L). \n \nJOHN  PIRO  (Chief  Deputy  Public  Defender,  Clark  County  Public  Defender’s \nOffice): \nI agree to removing section 8, subsection 2, “Any violation of this section is a \nmisdemeanor,” through the proposed amendment, Exhibit K.  \n \nSection 16, subsection 1, paragraph (d) does not raise the criminal penalty but \nadds the peer recovery support specialist into the growing list of those in an \nassault or battery constituting a gross misdemeanor rather than a misdemeanor. \nThis list has grown to the point where the exceptions are starting to swallow \nthe rules. We need peer support specialists to be protected from aggressive and \ndangerous  conduct,  however  do  not  believe  there  is  a  correlation  between \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 9, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nincreasing penalties and reduction in criminal behavior. The U.S. Department of \nJustice  has  studied  deterrents  in  this  manner  and  the  best  indicator  of \ndeterrents is a leniency of punishment, not an increase in penalty. \n \nIncreasing the penalty to a gross misdemeanor triggers a jury trial as opposed to \na  misdemeanor  bench  trial  which  increases  the  cost  of  prosecuting  and \ndefending  these  cases.  Most  affected  by  these  misdemeanor  trials  are  the \nmentally ill and drug-addicted. Removing section 16 language would allow us to \ngive our full support of S.B. 69. \n \nTREY DELAP (Director, Group Six Partners): \nI will read from my written testimony in opposition to S.B. 69 (Exhibit M). \n \nKENDRA BERTSCHY (Washoe County Public Defender’s Office): \nThe  Washoe  County  Public  Defender’s  Office  supports  the  peer  support \ncommunity,  hoping  they  are  able  to  help  the  citizens  of  our  community \novercome their addictions. For the reasons Mr. Piro stated, we are in opposition. \nWhen the enhancement was first established, there was testimony as to the \nconcern of the impact on those with mental health and substance abuse issues. \nThe  intent  is  to  ensure  we  help  those  involved  in  recovery;  however,  our \nconcern is the criminal enhancement.  \n \nSTEPHANIE WOODARD, PSY.D. (Senior Advisor on Behavioral Health, Division of \nPublic and Behavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services): \nBased  on  conversations  with  the  sponsor  on  the  bill  and  the  conceptual \namendment,  we  are  able  to  remove  the  fiscal  note  as  it  pertains  to  the \ndevelopment of regulation.  \n \nMARGOT  CHAPPEL  (Deputy  Administrator,  Division  of  Public  and  Behavioral \nHealth, Department of Health and Human Services): \nThe amendment removes the fiscal note from the Bureau of Healthcare Quality \nand Compliance as well. \n \nALLISON STEPHENS (Nevada PEP): \nI will read from my written testimony as neutral on S.B. 69 (Exhibit N), and \nhave provided a reference document on Family Peer Support (Exhibit O). \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 9, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nJOANNA JACOB (Clark County): \nClark County is neutral on Senate Bill 69. I am representing the Department of \nFamily Services today in a child welfare setting. The child welfare landscape is \nundergoing  a  fundamental  shift  toward  preventative  services  and \nevidence-based protocols, requiring implementation of some major policy at the \nfederal level. This model could be employed in the child welfare system for a \nparent in long-term successful and ongoing recovery, who may be able to help \nother  parents  struggling  with  substance  abuse  disorder  or  other  behavioral \nhealth disorders. We are in support of the overall goal and intent of the bill. We \nhave  asked  to  consider  a  technical  fix  and  offer  a  proposed  amendment \n(Exhibit P) to amend in the same requirements as agencies that employ those \nworking  with  children  or  families  to  undergo  a  background  check  with  the \nCentral  Registry  for  the  Collection  of  Information  Concerning  the  Abuse  or \nNeglect of a Child. This would include the screening for any substantiated report \nof abuse or neglect of a child. This is similar to other background checks in \nstatute.  \n \nDEBRA KAMKA (Director of Operations, Quest Counseling and Consulting): \nQuest Counseling and Consulting stands neutral on S.B. 69. We have had a \n16-year  relationship  with  our  community  coalition,  Join  Together  Northern \nNevada  (JTNN),  which  is  a  collaborative  organization.  Along  with  law \nenforcement,  JTNN  created  the  first  prescription  drug  roundup  to  address \nprescription  drug  abuse,  facilitate  monthly  committees  on  a  variety  of \ndrug-related topics and work with all interested parties to provide solutions to \ncommunity substance use problems. Quest Counseling and Consulting values \nthe YRBSS trend reports published by JTNN and its biennial prevention plan. It \nprovides informational rack cards or prescription drug lockboxes for our clients. \nCoalitions provide great value and local knowledge in their communities and can \naddress community problems at the local level quickly and in a cost-efficient \nmanner.  \n \nGWEN TAYLOR (Executive Director, Access For Community & Cultural Education \nPrograms & Trainings): \nWe are neutral on S.B. 69. I have worked with the local coalition, JTNN, since \n2002. Our community has substance abuse prevention coalitions that respond \nto community needs such as underage drinking, marijuana and prescription drug \nuse. Through JTNN, we have obtained subgranted general funds and federal \ngrant  dollars  to  reach  youth  through  evidence-based  programing  in  schools, \nafter-school programs, juvenile probation and in churches. We impact youth and \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 9, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nprovide  jobs  to  the  community  through  subgranted  funds.  Join  Together \nNorthern Nevada is able to bring the community together to address important \ndrug issues whether facilitating a committee, bringing in a national speaker or \norganizing a community event. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 69 and open the hearing on S.B. 70. \n \nSENATE BILL 70: Revises provisions governing mental health. (BDR 39-418) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN ROBIN L. TITUS (Assembly District No. 38): \nSenate  Bill 70  addresses  several  complex,  important  behavioral  healthcare \nissues in Nevada. This bill results from significant stakeholder engagements, \nmeetings, time and effort on the part of the Northern Regional Behavioral Health \nPolicy Board and its Coordinator, Jessica Flood. We met weekly for the better \npart of a year to develop this piece of legislation and proposed amendment \n(Exhibit Q).  \n \nIn  2017,  the  Legislature  passed  A.B. No. 366  of  the  79th  Session  which \ncreated the Northern, Washoe, Rural and Southern Behavioral Health Regions. \nThe bill established a behavioral health policy board for each region. The boards \nare  responsible  for  improvement  and  delivery  of  behavioral  health  services \nthroughout the State. They are required to advise relevant Executive Branch \nagencies  on  regional  behavioral  health  issues,  identify  gaps  in  services  and \ncoordinate with each other to provide recommendations to the Department of \nHealth and Human Services. Each board is authorized to request one bill draft \nrequest with regional, systemic State issues. \n \nIn  2019,  A.B. No. 76  of  the  80th  Session  was  sponsored  by  the  Southern \nRegional Behavioral Health Policy Board which revised the geographic locations \ncreating a fifth board and establishing the Clark Behavioral Health Region which \nnow consists of Clark County and a portion of Nye County.  \n \nThe 2021 Legislative Session is the second session in which the behavioral \nhealth policy boards have submitted a BDR. In 2019, the Northern Regional \nBehavioral Health Policy Board sponsored A.B. No. 85 of the 80th Session to \naddress  additional  gaps  and  challenges  existing  in  the  behavioral  healthcare \nsystem to better serve vulnerable Nevadans. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 9, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nTAYLOR ALLISON (Chair, Northern Regional Behavioral Health Policy Board): \nI will review the presentation for S.B. 70, Modernizing and Clarifying the Mental \nHealth Crisis Hold Process, from the Northern Regional Behavioral Health Policy \nBoard (Exhibit R), covering slides 1 through 3. \n \nWe are focused on modernizing, standardizing and reducing stigma in Nevada’s \nmental health crisis hold process found in Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 433A. \nWe are continuing the work initiated by our previous bill, A.B. No. 85 of the \n80th  Session,  which  passed  with  bipartisan  support  in  between \nLegislative Sessions.  \n \nAssembly Bill No. 85 of the 80th Session was brought forth by the Northern \nBoard after the need for policy change was identified in 2018. Individuals in \ncrisis in hospital emergency rooms have waited up to ten days for inpatient beds \nin psychiatric facilities. There have been various interpretations from courts and \nproviders on when the 72-hour clock begins, and NRS 433A utilized language to \ncreate additional stigma of individuals experiencing a mental health crisis. \n \nJessica Flood established a multiuse disciplinary, statewide mental health crisis \nhold working group to take a deep dive into the language and address those \ncritical  issues.  During  the  process  of  developing  A.B. No. 85  of  the \n80th Session, stakeholders gained a greater understanding of the issues and \ngaps in the law and saw the need for continued legislative efforts to update \nNRS 433A to better reflect the mental health crisis hold system we have today.  \n \nSince A.B. No. 85 of the 80th Session passed, the statewide mental health \ncrisis workgroup has continued to meet, working collaboratively with State staff \nand the Division of Public and Behavioral Health. They worked on regulations \nmandating hospital reporting of mental health crisis holds, clarifying medical \nclearance,  behavioral  health  transportation  and  the  process  for  involuntary \nadministration of medication. \n \nThe  Navigating  Your  Way  Through  a  Mental  Health  Crisis  Hold  in  Nevada \nbooklet emailed to the Senate Health and Human Services Committee reviews \nthe hold process, current law and patient rights. If S.B. 70 passes, the working \ngroup will continue to update the packet to reflect modern practice. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 9, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nJESSICA FLOOD (Coordinator, Northern Regional Behavioral Health Policy Board): \nI will provide an overview of mental health crisis holds in the remaining slides of \nour presentation, Exhibit R,  slide 5, labeled Mental Health Crisis Hold while \nreading from my written presentation (Exhibit S). \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nAre there concerns that when a peace officer comes to effectuate an order, the \nofficer may end up arresting the individual? Are there safeguards to ensure the \nindividual will enter into the mental health system, or will peace officers still be \nable to make an arrest? \n \nMS. FLOOD: \nThis is not an issue contemplated in the law. \n \nKATIE RYAN (Dignity Health - St. Rose Dominican): \nI  have  provided  a  letter  of  support  (Exhibit  T)  on  behalf  of  Dignity \nHealth - St. Rose Dominican.  \n \nMS. BERTSCHY: \nThe  Washoe  County  Public  Defender’s  Office  represented  2,185  individuals \nduring 2020 in involuntary commitment hearings. Unfortunately, the example \ngiven earlier by Ms. Flood, happens more than we would like. There are times \nwhen individuals involved in mental health crisis end up being arrested rather \nthan taken to a mental health treatment facility. This is something we hope to \nwork on in the future. It is the goal of the stakeholders to decrease interactions \nof law enforcement with someone experiencing a mental health crisis.  \n \nIn  section  11,  regarding  the  definition  of  when  someone  is  involved  in \ninvoluntary commitment, the intent is not to expand but to capture more people. \nThis  will  be  followed  closely  as  the  bill  nears  enactment  to  ensure  we  are \nfocusing on the individuals of need. We support S.B. 70. \n \nJIM HOFFMAN (Nevada Attorneys for Criminal Justice): \nI echo the comments by Ms. Bertschy and am in support of S.B. 70 and the \namendment. \n \nJOAN HALL (President, Nevada Rural Hospital Partners): \nNevada Rural Hospital Partners supports S.B. 70.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 9, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nJOANNE  MALAY  (Deputy  Administrator,  Clinical  Services  and  Mental  Health, \nDivision  of  Public  and  Behavioral  Health,  Department  of  Health  and \nHuman Services): \nThe Division of Public and Behavioral Health is neutral on this bill. We submitted \na fiscal note based on introductory language. Previous language in section 11 \nwas  permissible  as  Northern  Nevada  Adult  Mental  Health  Services  and  the \nSubstance  Abuse  and  Mental  Health  Services  Administration  are  the  only \ncurrent assisted outpatient treatment (AOT) programs. Without additional staff \nand other essentials, we would not be able to take on the additional workload. \nThe amendment, section 18 resolves the fiscal impact to the satisfaction of the \nDivision. The amendment Exhibit Q, adds that AOT would be ordered in the \ncounty where he or she resides, only if such services are available. \n \nAnother  language  amendment,  if  adopted,  resolves  further  fiscal  notes.  The \nlanguage regarding the intended evaluation would be ordered and responsibility \nfor  the  cost  of  the  examination  was  amended  to  state,  “other  than  those \nidentified in section 11, subsection 1, paragraphs (d) and (e)” of S.B. 70. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 70.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRemainder of page intentionally left blank; signature page to follow.   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 9, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAs there is no public comment, this meeting is adjourned at 6:03 p.m. \n \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED \n \n \n \n   \nVickie Polzien, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 9, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nExhibit  Begins \nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \nLetter  on Page \n  A  1    Agenda \nDorothy Edwards / \nS.B. 69  B  1  Department of Health  Bill Presentation Testimony \nand Human Services \nWashoe Regional \nS.B. 69  C  1  Prevention Overview \nBehavioral Health \nWashoe Regional  Assuring a Trained Certified \nS.B. 69  D  1 \nBehavioral Health  Peer Workforce \nWashoe Regional \nS.B. 69  E  1  Coalition Infographic \nBehavioral Health \nWashoe Regional \nS.B. 69  F  1  Consent Infographic \nBehavioral Health \nS.B. 69  G  1  Sean O’Donnell  Bill Presentation Testimony \nNatalie Powell / Nevada  Nevada Certification Board \nS.B. 69  H  1 \nCertification Board  Definitions \nNatalie Powell / Nevada \nS.B. 69  I  1  Bill Presentation Testimony \nCertification Board \nLinda Lang / Nevada \nS.B. 69  J  1  Statewide Coalition  Bill Presentation Testimony \nPartnership \nS.B. 69  K  1  Senator Julia Ratti  Proposed Amendment \nS.B. 69  L  1  Joanne Culver  Support Statement \nTrey Delap / GroupSix  Opposition and Concern \nS.B. 69  M  1 \nPartners  Statement \nAllison Stephens / \nS.B. 69  N  1  Neutral Statement \nNevada PEP \nAllison Stephens /  Family Peer Support At A \nS.B. 69  O  1 \nNevada PEP  Glance \nJoanna Jacob / Clark \nS.B. 69  P  1  Proposed Amendment \nCounty  \nAssemblywoman Robin \nS.B. 70  Q  1  Proposed Amendment \nL.

(BDR R-189) \n \nSENATOR JOSEPH P. HARDY (Senatorial District No. 12): \nThis is a bill urging business owners to provide personal protective equipment \n(PPE) to their workers. If we can do something that prevents the spread of the \ncoronavirus, also called SARS-CoV-2, which causes the Covid-19 disease, we \nwill protect our businesses, families, and people who come into our businesses. \nThere are many different ways we can enjoy protection, not just through the \nvaccines, that we can do now. \n \nThe bill provides businesses the opportunity to protect everyone, and for us, as \na Legislature, by sending a copy of this resolution to the Labor Commissioner. \nAt the Legislative Counsel Bureau, we have made an investment to ensure our \nemployees and others are protected. Wearing a mask is an act of appreciation \nand love for other people. This resolution is urging business owners to protect \ntheir people and others and protect the economy of their own businesses by \nusing masks, face shields, hand sanitizers and sanitized wipes. If we have a \nculture of protection, we will find it will pay benefits. \n \nSHANNON CHAMBERS (Labor Commissioner, Department of Business and Industry): \nI fully support this resolution, and at the Office of the Labor Commissioner, we \nissue  mandatory  bulletins  and  guidance  to  employers  who  look  to  us  for \nguidance on all types of issues including Covid-19. I think this is a wonderful \nidea, and to the extent it passes, I will make every effort to educate employers \nand make sure it is posted. The public health situation is an issue we all need to \naddress, and it certainly impacts labor. Over the past 12 months, this has been \na huge function of our Office. I support this resolution and will make every \neffort to do what is required once the resolution is passed. \n \nVICTORIA CARREON (Administrator, Division of Industrial Relations, Department of \nBusiness and Industry): \nOur agency includes Nevada  OSHA which has  been at the forefront of the \nCovid-19  enforcement  effort.  The  Safety,  Consultation  and  Training  Section \nprovides free safety, training and technical assistance to employers. Providing \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nPPE is a requirement under the Code of Federal Regulations. Face coverings are \nnot technically considered PPE; however, Nevada OSHA is requiring employers \nto provide face coverings to employees as part of its guidelines to complement \nthe Governor's directives. \n \nOur  Safety,  Consultation  and  Training  Section  conducts  monthly  classes  on \nPPE, has an outreach list of 2,500 people interested in safety issues for both \nemployers and employees, and uses an email list from the SilverFlume Nevada's \nBusiness  Portal  database  with  over  32,000  people.  We  would  be  happy  to \ncomply with S.C.R. 1 and would like to ensure that Nevada employees receive \nall the PPE they should have to protect themselves and others. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe Safety, Consultation and Training Section has three offices, in Reno, Elko \nand Las Vegas, which are reaching out to do what they can. It is admirable that \nwe have made this decision to protect each other and our businesses and return \nourselves to an economy as vibrant as it was before. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSenator Hardy, are you open to cosponsors? \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI  would  be  thrilled  and  complimented  if  anyone  wants  to  sign  on  to  this \nresolution.  I  do  not  think  we  can  do  enough.  If  we  want  to  make  a  good \ndecision and be a good example to people, I would invite anyone and everyone \nto sign on to this. Something that urges by example is a good idea. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI will sign on. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI would also like to sign on as a cosponsor. Would anyone else? Since everyone \nhas indicated agreement, we will send this resolution forward, first sponsored \nby  Senator  Hardy  and  the  entire  Senate  Committee  on  Health  and  Human \nServices. \n \nHearing no public testimony, I will close the hearing on S.C.R. 1 and entertain a \nmotion from Senator Spearman. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nMay I ask that S.C.R. 1 be amended to add all the cosponsors? \n \nERIC ROBBINS (Counsel): \nYou can add the cosponsors as an amendment to the resolution. \n \n  SENATOR SPEARMAN MOVED TO AMEND AND DO PASS S.C.R. 1. \n \n  SENATOR KIECKHEFER SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \n  THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will open the hearing on Senate Bill (S.B.) 61. \n \nSENATE BILL 61: Revises provisions governing the program for the operation of \nvending facilities by licensees who are blind. (BDR 38-320) \n \nSHELLEY  HENDREN  (Administrator,  Rehabilitation  Division,  Department  of \nEmployment, Training and Rehabilitation): \nI  present  S.B.  61  which  proposes  changes  to  Nevada  Revised  Statutes \n(NRS) 426, the statutes related to the Blind Business Enterprise of Nevada (BEN) \nProgram. I will read from my written testimony (Exhibit B). I have also submitted \nthe proposed amendments to the bill (Exhibit C). \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nI have a question about limiting it to two vending facilities as training sites. Can \nyou explain why it is limited to two, and are you worried that it might affect \nwho is able to participate? \n \nMS. HENDREN: \nWe  are  limiting  it  to  two  because  we  do  not  want  to  have  the  Bureau  of \nServices to Persons Who Are Blind or Visually Impaired take up too many sites \nthat could be awarded to blind licensees. We see the benefit of having training \nsites and people being able to get specific on-the-job training. We offer this and \nsome of our licensees host other trainees, but the idea of a training site is more \ncontrolled, and potential employees can get quality experience there. The limit \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nof two is because if we had viable sites, we want our licensees to own and \noperate them and reap the benefits. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nMy next question is about section 14 in S.B. 61. I understand there is a fee that \nwill be paid, and it looks like the licensees will be paying now. Who paid the \nfees before? It looks like it is an incentive paid by the licensee? \n \nMS. HENDREN: \nYes, it is an incentive, and we wanted to have flexibility where appropriate to \npay incentives. The set-aside fund is strictly limited on what can be paid out; \nincentive is the only means to do so. We modeled this after Tennessee law \nwhere that state is doing this. Licensees cannot be charged typical fees such as \nrent, fees or assessments. We added the incentive to give ourselves flexibility \nwith  our  partners,  if  appropriate.  As  this  section  says,  this  is  optional  and \nnegotiable, and both parties must agree. The Bureau, upon opening a vending \nfacility to a department or agency, cannot be contingent upon payment of an \nincentive. \n \nRICHARD SAPERSTEIN (Chair, Nevada Committee of Blind Vendors): \nI have been in the BEN Program for 33 years. The amendments to NRS 426 are \nimportant. They align the State Program to the federal program and help solidify \nthe  perpetuity  of  the  BEN  Program.  I  do  not  know  how  many  Committee \nmembers know the history of the BEN Program. In 1985 when I began losing \nmy sight, I had no idea what I was going to do. I was college-educated, a \ndistrict manager for a pizza chain, and the food and beverage director at Circus \nHotel Casino. This Program has helped me immensely to become successful and \nmaintain my financial standing. The Program has done this for many others as \nwell. I support the Program in every way I can, and I encourage the Committee \nto  adopt  these  amendments  so  people  in  the  future  will  have  a  solid  BEN \nProgram that will help them achieve the same things it helped me achieve. \n \nIVAN DELGADO: \nI am from Las Vegas and a blind business owner. I have been in the business for \nfive years and it has been a blessing. I finished high school but had not much \nelse going for myself. Luckily, I got to take advantage of the Program. These \namendments are needed and I support the bill. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nDAVID CHERRY (City of Henderson): \nWe met with the bill sponsors to discuss the City's concerns regarding proposed \nchanges in S.B. 61. The amendment presented today begins to address some of \nthe  issues  we  outlined;  however,  we  remain  opposed  at  this  time.  We \nappreciate continuing to work with Administrator Hendren and her team. The \nCity  already  offers  blind  entrepreneurs  in  the  BEN  Program  business \nopportunities  at  multiple  City  facilities  and  recognizes  the  benefits  of  the \nProgram  for  those  it  serves.  Our  main  concern  is  to  retain  a  system  that \nmaintains  the  consent-based  framework  in  the  statutes  when  determining  if \nvending services are needed and, if so, what type. \n \nWe want to see stronger protections when it comes to existing leases obtaining \nwaivers.  There  should  be  certainty  when  people  make  large  investments  or \nenter  into  partnership  agreements  to  operate  the  facilities  on  City  property. \nThese waivers should enjoy statutory protection with a defined process in law. \n \nThere  are  also  concerns  regarding  the  authority  to  void  contracts  that  is \nincluded in S.B. 61. We oppose the change away from the existing 30-day \nnotice period. This has proven sufficient in the past, and moving to a further \nwindow does not provide adequate time to fulfill this requirement. The City \nappreciates  the  bill  sponsor's  amendment  that  defines  an  exception  from \nNRS 426  requirements  when  a  lease  is  granted  to  an  operator  for  live \nentertainment purposes. The amendment offers a narrow definition that could \npreclude private entities that provide different types of activities and levels of \nservice for sizable financial resources. The BEN Program cannot compete with \ntheir sizeable financial resources by its own acknowledgement. \n \nWe urge the Committee to review statute language preserved in the bill that \nmakes it a misdemeanor crime if someone delivers a sandwich or pizza ordered \nby a worker in a building where there is a BEN Program operator who sells the \nsame products. This is outdated and unnecessary. We feel it could also apply to \na parent selling candy on behalf of a child's activity. We think at a minimum we \nshould remove the misdemeanor penalty and handle it through an administrative \nprocess that does not rely on some type of a criminal penalty. The exceptions \nare limited to only certain types of entities that would qualify. While you already \nhave some exceptions that you would think cover the candy sales I mentioned, \nit depends on the type of activity—let us say a dance team or sports activity. If \nthese are not incorporated in a certain way under NRS, they would not enjoy \nthat exemption. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nJOANNA JACOB (Clark County): \nWe  oppose  this  bill  and  have  had  conversations  with  the  Division  of \nEmployment,  Training  and  Rehabilitation  (DETR)  regarding  our  concerns. \nClark County  partners  with  DETR  on  the  BEN  Program,  and  is  working  to \nexpand access within the County wherever we can. Something unique to the \nCounty we need to work through are questions from McCarran International \nAirport, which falls under our County Department of Aviation. The Airport has \ninput from the Federal Aviation Administration on this bill. There are concerns \nraised that we were not able to work through about federal regulations and \nrequirements. Particularly, preemptions are in place with different transportation \nguidelines and concerns because airports are supported by user fees, which are \nusually prohibited from diversion to other purposes. \n \nWe believe we can work this through and have already raised these concerns \nwith Ms. Hendren. We are concerned section 7 was drafted a little broadly, but \nit could be interpreted to apply to existing contracts. We understand it was not \nthe sponsor's intent, and we presented an idea to make that section applicable \nto contracts entered into after this bill passes. \n \nWe  also  have  concerns  about  the  use  of  third-party  vendors.  The  way \nsection 11, subsection 7 was drafted, the language looks like it was going to \nallow  third-party  vendors  to  take  on  licensee  responsibilities.  We  now \nunderstand DETR is looking to narrow third-party vendors, and this section is \nnot intended to open up opportunities to a whole host of third-party vendors. \nWe are going to work on clarification and bring it back to this Committee. \n \nDAVID DAZLICH (Vegas Chamber): \nI oppose this bill. My colleagues at Clark County and the City of Henderson \nhave illustrated well the objections that the Vegas Chamber has with this bill. \nOur concern is for those private entities operating leases on public property, and \nwe too would like to see stronger language protecting the waivers in statute. \nMs. Hendren's amendments are going in the right direction. We look forward to \nremoving our opposition as we work through this bill. \n \nCHAUNSEY CHAU-DUONG (Las Vegas Valley Water District): \nI want to share comments regarding our opposition to S.B. 61. We recently \nsigned  an  agreement  with  the  DETR  BEN  Program  to  provide  services  for \nemployees, and that process went well. A conceptual amendment provided by \nDETR addresses some of the concerns we have. We want to work with DETR \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nregarding section 7, which could still grant DETR exclusive discretion regarding \nwhat locations are appropriate for vending facilities.  Section 11, which requires \npublic entities to cooperate with DETR, makes such a determination. As a public \nentity, we should be able to make these determinations ourselves, particularly in \ninstances when the vending facility exclusively serves employees. The language \nshould be clarified responding to Covid-19; we appreciate the ability to make \nchanges to our limited food service options and to adapt to the pandemic. We \nwould be happy to work with DETR to obtain answers to our questions and \naddress our concerns. \n \nKELLY CROMPTON (City of Las Vegas): \nThe City of Las Vegas opposes S.B. 61 but supports the Program since we have \nbeen  a  partner  and  gone  through  the  process  during  the  construction  of \nCity Hall. We believe the proposed amendment is a good starting point. The \nmajority of our concerns have been addressed by the City of Henderson and \nClark County, so I will leave our opposition at that. \n \nARIELLE EDWARDS (City of North Las Vegas): \nThe City of North Las Vegas opposes S.B. 61 and echoes the remarks made by \nour colleagues from Clark County and the City of Henderson. \n \nSTEVE COHEN: \nI am testifying in a neutral position. Granted this argument is made in a policy \ncommittee, but during Covid-19, most of the government facilities that would \nbe a beneficiary of this Program are closed to the public. I fully support the \ninclusion of people with disabilities in the general workforce. \n \nMS. HENDREN: \nI appreciate the comments and am open to and available to work with those \nentities and hopefully find a solution that works for everyone. Our position is to \npromote the Program and opportunities it provides for individuals who are blind \nto be entrepreneurs Statewide. This is an old Program, having been on the \nbooks for 85 years federally and over 60 years in Nevada. Certainly, I would not \nlike to make changes that do not benefit the Program or blind licensees.  There \nare areas we could clear up and compromises we could make, such as waivers \nand potentially NRS 426.715 regarding misdemeanors.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI did hear from people who were in opposition in advance of the hearing. I want \nto  note  this  hearing  was  scheduled  early  in  the  Session  on  relatively  short \nnotice. I appreciate the interest and the stakeholders working together to move \nthis bill. It is an important Program, and we want to make sure we get it right. I \nhave  asked  the  local  government  representatives  to  work  together.  Perhaps \nthere  could  be  one  group  voice  as  opposed  to  six  or  seven  separate \nconversations. I hope to help our team at DETR make it through the amendment \nprocess. We look forward to hearing back on your resolutions. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRemainder of page left intentionally blank; signature page to follow. \n \n \n \n   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThere being no further questions, we will close the meeting on S.B. 61. \n \nHearing no public comment, the meeting is adjourned at 4:34 p.m. \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n   \nNorma Mallett, \nCommittee Secretary \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nFebruary 11, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nExhibit  Begins \nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \nLetter  on Page \n  A  1    Agenda \nShelley Hendren/ \nDepartment of \nS.B. 61  B  1  Presentation \nEmployment, Training \nand Rehabilitation \nShelley Hendren/ \nDepartment of \nS.B. 61  C  1  Proposed Amendment \nEmployment, Training \nand Rehabilitation \n "], "3": ["\nMINUTES OF THE MEETING \nOF THE \nASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n \nEighty-First Session \nMarch 3, 2021 \n \nThe  Committee  on  Health  and  Human  Services  was  called  to  order  by \nChair Rochelle T.

The  Chair  reminded  Committee  members  of  the  protocol  of  virtual \nmeetings.]  Today we have our first work session and we will be proceeding with the work \nsession document that our Research Division has provided to all of you.  That document is \nalso available on the Nevada Electronic Legislative Information System for members of the \npublic.  Let us begin with Assembly Bill 16.  Our Policy Analyst, Patrick Ashton, will \nsummarize the bill.    \n \nAssembly Bill 16:  Revises provisions related to the issuance of copies of certificates and \nrecords of birth. (BDR 40-329) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \n[Patrick  Ashton  reviewed  the  work  session  document,  Exhibit  C].    As  a  reminder,  as \nnonpartisan staff, I can neither advocate nor oppose any measures you will consider today.  \nMembers of the Committee, you should have received the work session document by email, \nand you can also find it on the Nevada Electronic Legislative Information System.  We will \nbegin the work session with Assembly Bill 16 which we heard on February 17, 2021. \n \nAssembly Bill 16 prohibits the State Registrar and any person or governmental organization \nfrom charging a fee for the issuance of a certified or official copy of a birth certificate or \nrecord of birth to a person who submits documentation from the Department of Corrections \nthat the person is currently imprisoned.  There were no amendments. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI would like to remind members of the Committee that we do have most of the bill presenters \nand some other people here to answer any questions; however, this is not the time to rehash \nthe policy of the bill or to rehear the bill.  If any Committee members have any questions or \ncomments they would like to make regarding the bill, please let me know. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  TITUS  MADE  A  MOTION  TO  DO  PASS \nASSEMBLY BILL 16. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN GORELOW SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nAre there any comments on the motion?  [There were none.]  We would normally do a voice \nvote, but because we are in this virtual setting, I will ask the secretary to commence a roll call \nvote.  \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 3, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nTHE MOTION PASSED.  (ASSEMBLYWOMEN BENITEZ-THOMPSON \nAND KRASNER WERE ABSENT FOR THE VOTE.) \n \nI will assign the floor statement to Vice Chair Peters.   \n \nWith that, we will begin the work session on Assembly Bill 26, and again, I will turn this \nover to Mr. Ashton to describe the bill and any possible amendments.  \n \nAssembly  Bill  26:    Revises  provisions  governing  programs  of  energy  assistance. \n(BDR 58-298) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \n[Patrick Ashton reviewed the work session document, Exhibit D].  The next bill on our work \nsession document is Assembly Bill 26 which we heard on February 15, 2021.  This bill \nclarifies that the annual report regarding the Fund for Energy Assistance and Conservation \nprepared and submitted to the money committees by the Division of Welfare and Supportive \nServices of the Department of Health and Human Services must specify the amount of \nmoney in the Fund that:  (1) has been allocated to and received by the Division on or before \nJune 30 of all preceding fiscal years; and (2) remains unspent and unencumbered as of \nDecember 31 of the fiscal year in which the report is being made.   \n \nThis bill also clarifies that the Division may be required to distribute a certain percentage of \nmoney in the Fund that is unspent and unencumbered on or before June 30 of all preceding \nfiscal years to the Housing Division of the Department of Business and Industry.  There were \nno amendments. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any questions from the Committee?  [There were none.]  Do I have a motion? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  TITUS  MADE  A  MOTION  TO  DO  PASS \nASSEMBLY BILL 26. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION PASSED.  (ASSEMBLYWOMEN BENITEZ-THOMPSON \nAND KRASNER WERE ABSENT FOR THE VOTE.) \n \nAs this bill has to do with energy, power, and utilities, I will assign the floor statement to \nAssemblyman Hafen. \n \nWe will now move on to our work session on Assembly Bill 35, and I will turn it over to \nPatrick Ashton. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 3, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nAssembly  Bill  35:    Revises  provisions  governing  certain  programs  to  assist  senior \ncitizens  and  persons  with  disabilities  with  costs  relating  to  health  care. \n(BDR 40-288) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \n[Patrick Ashton reviewed the work session document, Exhibit E].  Next is Assembly Bill 35, \nwhich we heard on February 22, 2021.   \n \nThis bill consolidates two financial assistance programs for senior citizens and persons with \ndisabilities, financed by the Fund for a Healthy Nevada, into a single program.  This bill also \nrevises eligibility requirements for the consolidated program and removes language stating \nthat certain senior citizens and persons with disabilities are entitled to assistance under the \nprogram.  Under the consolidated program, a person is eligible to receive assistance with \nprescription drug costs, pharmaceutical services, and certain other services if he or she is \na state resident; meets certain requirements prescribed by regulation of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services; and is 60 years of age or older or has a physical or intellectual \ndisability or a related condition.  There were no amendments. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any questions? \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI need some clarification on A.B. 35, please.  In section 6, it lists people \"60 years of age or \nolder.\"  Then, in section 13, it lists people \"62 years of age or older.\"  Are there going to be \ndifferent services depending on age?  Was that intentional? \n \nKarly O'Krent, Committee Counsel: \nSection 13 of the bill is the definition that is applicable to Chapter 612 of the Nevada Revised \nStatutes (NRS).  The remaining provisions of the bill deal with Chapter 439 of NRS, so, to \nthe extent that the bill is consolidating the two programs, the definition \"60 years of age or \nolder\" would apply. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nWas that intentional that they only wanted age 62 under section 13? \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nDuring the hearing I asked for clarification on that and it was purposeful, in part, because \nthey were changing only the specific program and not the 62-years-and-up provision.  That \nensured that that program did not get changed in addition to the specific ones that the bill \naddresses. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI am sorry I did not pick up on that.  Also, I need clarification for the record.  During the \nhearing I asked whether this would increase costs because there was no fiscal note, but the \nbill did have a notation that it might affect the State.  At that time, we were told that there \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 3, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nwas a list of folks and that there should not be any additional cost because of that waiting list.  \nI just want to confirm that this bill does not have a fiscal note. \n \nRique  Robb,  Deputy  Administrator,  Aging  and  Disability  Services  Division, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services: \nThere is not a fiscal note attached to A.B. 35. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nIs that because there is going to be a waiting list and you are not really expanding the number \nof people who might get the services?  If you expand the number of people who are getting \nthe services, there should be an additional cost; however, there are only so many openings.  \nIs that what I am hearing? \n \nRique Robb: \nCorrect.  There are x number of openings for the current budget, and should they exceed that, \nwe would implement a wait list. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank you.  That was mostly for clarification.  \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  TITUS  MADE  A  MOTION  TO  DO  PASS \nASSEMBLY BILL 35. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN GORELOW SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION PASSED.  (ASSEMBLYWOMAN BLACK VOTED NO.  \nASSEMBLYWOMEN  BENITEZ-THOMPSON  AND  KRASNER  WERE \nABSENT FOR THE VOTE.) \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI will assign that floor statement to Assemblywoman Gorelow, and we will move on to the \nwork session on Assembly Bill 62.  Mr. Ashton, I will turn that over to you. \n \nAssembly Bill 62:  Revises provisions relating to the Nevada ABLE Savings Program. \n(BDR 38-397) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \n[Patrick Ashton reviewed the work session document, Exhibit F].  Assembly Bill 62 was \nheard on February 10, 2021.  This bill authorizes the state treasurer to include certain \nprocedures for the administration of the Nevada ABLE Savings Program in any regulations \nadopted by the state treasurer relating to the Program.  The bill also:  (1) authorizes the state \ntreasurer to apply for and accept any gift, grant, donation, bequest, or other source of money \nto carry out the Program; and (2) requires the state treasurer to deposit any money so \nreceived in the Endowment Account established for the Program.  Finally, this bill authorizes \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 3, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nmoney in the Endowment Account to be used for contributions to savings trust accounts.  \nThere are no amendments. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any questions from the Committee?  [There was no response.] \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  PETERS  MADE  A  MOTION  TO  DO  PASS \nASSEMBLY BILL 62. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN TITUS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION PASSED.  (ASSEMBLYWOMEN BENITEZ-THOMPSON \nAND KRASNER WERE ABSENT FOR THE VOTE.) \n \nI will assign the floor statement to Assemblywoman Thomas.  We will now go to our final \nwork session on Assembly Joint Resolution 1.  Mr. Ashton, will you summarize the bill and \nthe amendments, please? \n \nAssembly Joint Resolution 1:  Proposes to amend the Nevada Constitution to revise \nterms relating to persons with certain conditions for whose benefit certain public \ninstitutions are supported by the State. (BDR C-477) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \n[Patrick  Ashton  reviewed  the  work  session  document,  Exhibit  G].    Assembly  Joint \nResolution 1 was heard on February 10, 2021.  This resolution proposes to amend Section 1 \nof Article 13 of the Nevada Constitution by replacing the description of persons who benefit \nfrom institutions fostered and supported by the state from:  (1) \"insane\" to \"persons with a \nsignificant mental illness\"; (2) \"blind\" to \"persons who are blind or visually impaired\"; and \n(3) \"deaf and dumb\" to \"persons who are deaf or hard of hearing.\" \n \nThis resolution has two amendments.  The first is proposed by Jennifer Richards, Chief Elder \nand  Disability  Rights  Attorney,  Aging  and  Disability  Services  Division,  Department  of \nHealth and Human Services.  You may also see the attached document [page 2, Exhibit G].  \nThis amendment would change the wording on page 1, line 7, by inserting \"or persons who \nhave an intellectual or developmental disability\" before the word \"and.\"  This addition is \nintended to ensure that all persons with disabilities are included under Section 1 of Article 13 \nof the Nevada Constitution, including persons with intellectual or developmental disabilities. \n \nThe second amendment is from Assemblywoman Titus who proposes to add the following \nsponsors to the measure:  Primary joint sponsors are Senators Joseph (Joe) P. Hardy, M.D., \nDallas Harris, and Heidi Seevers Gansert.  Assembly members are Teresa Benitez-Thompson \nand Lisa Krasner.  Nonprimary joint sponsors are Senators Ben Kieckhefer and Julia Ratti \nand Assembly members Michelle Gorelow, Gregory T. Hafen II, Alexis Hansen, Melissa \nHardy, Andy Matthews, Rochelle T. Nguyen, David Orentlicher, Sarah Peters, Shondra \nSummers-Armstrong, and Clara (Claire) Thomas. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 3, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre  there  any  questions  from  Committee  members  about  A.J.R.  1  and  the  proposed \namendments?   \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nHas Assemblywoman Titus given any consideration to my suggestion?   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAssemblywoman Titus, have you given any consideration to her amendment? \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI thought I had responded to your suggestion.  I felt that was pretty well covered by the state's \nrecommended amendment which adds \"intellectual or developmental\" disabilities.  We want \nto get this right because it is a constitutional change, so if you still have concerns that we \nneed additional clarification language, or if that did not resolve your question, you can reach \nout when this bill goes over to the Senate.  We can do the same amendment process if you \nneed further clarification. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nThank you, I appreciate that. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any other questions from Committee members?  [There was no reply.]  Seeing \nnone, I will entertain a motion to amend and do pass A.J.R. 1. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS MADE A MOTION TO AMEND AND DO \nPASS ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION 1. \n \nASSEMBLYMAN HAFEN SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION PASSED.  (ASSEMBLYWOMEN BENITEZ-THOMPSON \nAND KRASNER WERE ABSENT FOR THE VOTE.)  \n \nI will assign that floor statement to Assemblywoman Titus. \n \n[Exhibit H was submitted but not discussed and will become part of the record.] \n \nThat closes out our work session for today.  Committee members, we do have three bill draft \nrequests  (BDRs)  from  the  Legislative  Committee  on  Health  Care.    It  was  an  interim \ncommittee  that  voted  out  several  recommendations.    They  do  require  a  Committee \nintroduction, and I would like to introduce them today.  Please note that by voting in favor of \nintroducing the BDR, it does not imply a commitment to vote or even support the measure \nlater.  The action just allows the BDR to become a bill, be introduced on the floor, and be \nreferred to the Committee for possible hearing. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 3, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nWe will begin with BDR 38-449.  It requires the State Plan for Medicaid to include coverage \nfor services of a community health worker in certain circumstances.  Do I have a motion to \nintroduce BDR 38-449? \n \nBDR 38-449—Requires the State Plan for Medicaid to include coverage for the services of \na community  health  worker  under  certain  circumstances.    (Later  introduced  as \nAssembly Bill 191.) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN GORELOW MADE A MOTION TO INTRODUCE \nBDR 38-449. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN TITUS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIs there any discussion?  [There was no response.] \n \nTHE MOTION PASSED.  (ASSEMBLYWOMEN BENITEZ-THOMPSON \nAND KRASNER WERE ABSENT FOR THE VOTE.) \n \nThe next bill draft request we would like to introduce today is BDR 38-452.  It expands \nMedicaid coverage of postpartum and other services for pregnant women.  Do I have a \nmotion to introduce BDR 38-452? \n \nBDR 38-452—Expands Medicaid coverage of postpartum and other services for pregnant \nwomen.  (Later introduced as Assembly Bill 193.) \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN GORELOW MADE A MOTION TO INTRODUCE \nBDR 38-452. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  SUMMERS-ARMSTRONG  SECONDED  THE \nMOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION PASSED.

The Chair reminded Committee members, witnesses, and members of the \naudience of Committee rules, protocol, and procedures for virtual meetings.] \n \nI will now open the hearing on Assembly Bill 181. \n \nAssembly Bill 181:  Revises provisions relating to mental health. (BDR 40-522) \n \nAssemblywoman Sarah Peters, Assembly District No. 24: \nThank you for hearing Assembly Bill 181, which is related to mental health today.  There are \ntwo parts to the bill.  The first piece of the bill relates to the collection of mental and \nbehavioral health data from hospital providers.  The second piece of the bill is related to \nmental health parity data collected from insurance providers.  The focus of this bill is on the \npeople—the patients—who are in need of services provided by both sides of the equation.  \nOverwhelmingly, data presented to date regarding mental- and behavioral-related deaths by \nsuicide and overdose have increased at alarming rates during the COVID-19 pandemic.  I do \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 8, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nnot think there is a single person in this room who can say that suicide is not a concern in the \nstate of Nevada.  We have consistently been identified as having some of the highest rates of \nsuicide  among  most  demographics  published,  including  vulnerable  populations  such  as \nveterans, LGBTQIA teens, and others. \n \nThe  data  gap  identified  by  the  Division  of  Public  and  Behavioral  Health  (DPBH), \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, exists at the moment a patient cries for help and \nservices are initially provided.  This means the moment a patient exhibits suicide ideation, \nself-harm, or other suicide risk indicators.  That is where we need this data.  Data on \ncompleted suicides or attempted suicides show that we are already too late with providing \nintervention services.  This bill proposes collection of data prior to suicide attempts and \nidentifies those patients, those family, and friends who need help today.  I have with me \nDr. Stephanie Woodard, Senior Advisor on Behavioral Health with DPBH who will briefly \ndiscuss this portion of the bill. \n \nStephanie Woodard, Psy.D., Senior Advisor on Behavioral Health, Division of Public \nand Behavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services: \nI am here to present to you on sections 1 through 6 of A.B. 181, which establishes statutory \nauthority for the Division of Public and Behavioral Health to require health facilities to report \nsuicide attempts to the Division.   \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nWe have submitted a draft amendment [Exhibit C] regarding this piece of the bill, and \nI would like to direct Committee members to the Nevada Electronic Legislative Information \nSystem (NELIS) to see that amendment. \n \nStephanie Woodard: \nNationally, an individual dies by suicide every 11 minutes.  More than ten Nevadans die by \nsuicide every week, which is more than one person every day.  According to the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, Nevada has ranked in the top ten states for deaths by \nsuicide, and while progress has been made, there is still a need to do more.   \n \nFor several years, the primary data source we have used to develop our suicide prevention \nefforts has been fatality data as well as hospital billing and claims data.  While these two data \npoints are necessary in helping us understand suicide in Nevada, we know that they are not \nsufficient.  Over the past two years, we have been working with hospitals and health systems \nto implement \"Zero Suicide.\"  The Zero Suicide initiative is grounded in the idea that suicide \ncan be prevented and that detecting, assessing, and treating suicidality is effective.  All of this \nis driven by data.  The data we seek to collect through this reporting will help us all \nunderstand what is occurring—at a hospital level, a community level, as well as a statewide \nlevel—with a timely and accurate focus.  The importance of this data, in addition to other \nindicators we collect on suicide, will help us to design and deploy responsive interventions to \nprevent suicide. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 8, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nIn 2017, similar legislation was passed as the opioid crisis was surging, and we recognized \nwe needed to gather more timely data to detect changes in nonfatal overdoses happening \nacross the state and in our communities.  Using this data, we have been able to develop \ninterventions, including mobile recovery outreach teams, to support individuals following \nnonfatal overdoses.  We have seen the value of this kind of data informing action.  We \nrecognize  the  need  to  have  a  balanced  approach  for  requiring  data  reporting.    We  are \ncommitted to taking steps to reduce as much of the burden of reporting as we can while \nensuring the necessary data can be collected in a timely way.  As Assemblywoman Peters \nmentioned, we have developed an amendment to the proposed legislation.  The amendment \nplaces the statutory authority within Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 441A.  It is modeled \non the overdose reporting that was established in 2017.  Assembly Bill 181 would allow the \nDivision  to  develop  regulations  that  would  further  delineate  the  details  of  reporting \nrequirements.  The process of developing these regulations involved input from stakeholders \nand includes public workshops and hearings to ensure ample opportunity where input is \nconsidered. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nI will now go to the second part of this bill which gets at another issue we see:  mental health \ncoverage.    This  is  related  to  insurance  coverage.    Some  of  the  most  overwhelming \nconversations I have had with people are not about their heart medication, access to vaccines, \nor ability to schedule surgery; it is about access to mental and behavioral health services that \npatients need today.  The federal government requires compliance with the Paul Wellstone \nand Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008.  This act is \ncurrently mentioned in our statutes; however, there is a lack of clarity in the health and \ninsurance industry as to what parity methods are—what makes up parity.  Consistently I hear \nfrom constituents and patients that their coverage misses the mark.   \n \nWe are not proposing a prescription to remedy this parity ambiguity today.  We are, however, \nrequesting that the Division of Insurance, Department of Business and Industry, have the \nauthority to proactively review parity metrics from insurance providers in the state, including \nPEBP [Public Employees' Benefits Program] and Medicaid, to determine what the baseline \nof parity is in Nevada.  I have heard from the insurance industry that parity reporting is \nrequired by the federal government; however, the federal government is not the folks on the \nground hearing the complaints from constituents and trying to assess and determine parity \nviolations.  That burden already falls to the state and even then, it is not proactive.  The state \nprocess for addressing parity starts on the backs of our vulnerable populations who have felt \nthat their right to parities of service have been violated.  These individuals have to submit a \ncomplaint with supporting evidence to the Consumer Services Section of the Division of \nInsurance for review of their cases.  This is usually done when the patients learn that the \nservices they are looking for are not being covered and not accessible for their immediate \nneeds.  This bill requests that this activity be completed proactively rather than on the backs \nof the patients already in need of support.  \n \nAn amendment to this bill will request that the Patient Protection Commission within in the \nOffice of the Governor takes these two data streams and use them to assess and determine \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 8, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nadequacy of coverage from both the services and insurance sides for patients in Nevada.  \nAlthough this bill requests data directly from the industry, this is a patient-centric bill, \nfocusing on the two sides of the sword representing the burden of mental health care in our \nstate. \n \nI want to be clear that we are looking at an amendment for the second section [Exhibit D], \nbut I do not think it was accessible on NELIS when we started this hearing.  I will be sure it \nis  sent  to  Committee  members  so  you  can  see  the  conceptual  amendment  I have  been \nworking on with the Division of Insurance to create a less prescriptive statute around this \nissue and also to include the Patient Protection Commission directive to get this data from \nthese two data streams.   \n \nI am not going to go through the sections of this bill, but there has been recent federal \nlegislation related to the reporting requirements of insurance companies, and I have been \nworking with the Division of Insurance to ensure that the language in this bill allows the \nDivision  of  Insurance  to  incorporate  those  federal  requirements  while  also  meeting  the \ndesired parity outcomes proposed through adoption of this bill.  The amendment will modify \nsections 7 through 9 to remove that prescriptive language. \n \nAt this time, I will pass the discussion on to Lea Case who will talk more about mental health \nparity coverage and what it means to the state of Nevada. \n \nLea Case, representing Nevada Psychiatric Association: \n[Lea Case submitted a letter of support Exhibit E].  This bill requires a more proactive \napproach to compliance with the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act.  From 2018 \nto 2020, 13 other states have passed legislation that is largely identical to A.B. 181 requiring \ninsurers  to  submit  the  analyses  to  state  regulators  showing  their  compliance  with  the \nprovisions of the federal parity act.  There have been cases in The New York Times and in \nnational news of big insurance companies that are not compliant with federal parity laws, but \nwe do not always hear of that happening in our home state.   \n \nIn July 2019, a Nevada Psychiatric Association member physician noticed that the behavioral \nhealth summary of services for a  managed care company included processes that were \napplied more stringently than processes for medical/surgical benefits.  Further, there were \npolicies and processes in place for mental health and substance use services that did not have \nany  comparable  processes  for  medical/surgical  services.    The  American  Psychiatric \nAssociation and Nevada Psychiatric Association submitted a letter to Nevada Medicaid on \nAugust  8,  2019.    We  want  to  applaud  Nevada  Medicaid's  quick  action  in  opening  an \ninvestigation and resolving the parity issue with the insurer on January 6, 2020.   \n \nThis demonstrates a need for a proactive approach to parity compliance; if this psychiatrist \nhad not taken personal time to investigate their patient's insurance policy to determine why \nthey were being denied care, this complaint would not have been submitted and the insurer \nwould continue to be noncompliant.  Parity compliance should be determined by the experts \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 8, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nin parity and insurance regulation at the Division of Insurance before insurance products \nreach a consumer. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you for that presentation.  Are there questions from the Committee? \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank you for bringing this forward.  We can all agree that suicide is an incredibly important \nissue we need to deal with, and we have seen even more of it during this pandemic.  You \nspeak about timely data collection, and that is one of my concerns about this bill.  When we \nhave a potential suicide come through our emergency room (ER), et cetera, we do not make \nthat determination right away.  There could be toxicology issues,  or sometimes it is a \ncoroner's case because if they die within so many hours of coming into the ER, it becomes a \ncoroner's case.  So there is a delay in getting some information.  What is a reasonable \nexpectation about \"timely notification\"?      \n \nStephanie Woodard: \nIt  is  a  great  question  and  something  we  would  like  to  discuss  during  the  regulatory \ndevelopment process.  Currently, the billing and claims data that we have would, potentially, \nprovide this information to us, but because of the lag, we are getting that data 90 to 120 days \nout.  Certainly, anything sooner than that would be major progress.  We also recognize that \nthere  is  a  need  for  syndromic  surveillance  data.    Recently,  we  have  been  able  to  pull \nsyndromic surveillance data related to suicide attempts and ideation from our emergency \nrooms.  It is an incomplete data set because we are only getting about 80 percent of the \nreporting through syndromic surveillance, but we intend to use the syndromic surveillance \nreally for that timely reporting so that we can have a finger on the pulse of what is happening \nstatewide.  When we use syndromic surveillance, we know we are sacrificing accuracy for \ntimeliness because of the way that data is pulled from the EHRs [electronic health records].  \nWe are really looking for this other dataset to be able to balance against the syndromic \nsurveillance dataset, so we recognize that we may be sacrificing some of that timeliness but \nwe will then be able to get the accuracy. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nDo all hospitals have access to that surveillance set and data information?  One of the \nproblems I see here is the amount of reporting hospitals are required to do.  You are not \nasking the provider to do this; you are asking the medical facility to do this.  Who are the \nother folks who have to report this kind of data?  Providers are already mandatory reporters \nfor different levels of things, and this is another level of reporting that hospitals would have \nto do.  The hospitals already have to do extensive reporting.  Will they be using the same \ncomputer system?  You mentioned electronic medical records (EMRs), and we know that \nmany EMRs do not communicate with each other, so what is that going to look like?  Once \nyou have determined the time frame, will there be a fine if they do not follow through?  \nI think the information is critical, but I am still worried about the process. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 8, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nStephanie Woodard: \nFor  overdose  reporting,  hospitals  currently  have  three  different  pathways.    The  first  is \nprobably  the  easiest  because  it  allows  for  a  data  extraction  to  occur  directly  from  the \nelectronic health record.  This data extraction is then placed in a file which is sent to the \nDivision of Public and Behavioral Health.  Another way is through a fax.  We recognize that \nnot all electronic health records have the capabilities nor maybe the sophistication to be able \nto develop and extract the data file, so the fax is an option several hospitals continue to use \nfor overdose reporting.  We have also worked with Bitfocus's Clarity, a vendor used by other \nhospitals to report into the Homeless Management Information System.  We worked with \nthem to develop a data platform for overdose reporting, and we are working with them \ncurrently to augment that report so hospitals using that for overdose reporting would be able \nto use it to satisfy the requirements of this bill. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI have looked at the bill and the proposed amendment involving sections 7 through 9 to \nremove the prescriptive language related to data collection.  I have a question regarding that \nprocess of reporting.  Conceptually, I think it is a good idea.  As a provider, when I see a \npatient and I determine that the patient needs x, y, or z, it is very frustrating when we try to \nget prior authorization and the insurer says it is not covered or no, instead you have to do a, \nb, and c first.  I think I understand what you are trying to achieve here, but I am wondering \nwhether there are other mandatory descriptions in statute for when insurance companies deny \na service?  Is that listed anywhere, or would this be a unique thing to mental health parity?  \nAre we asking the insurance companies to do something they already do and then add that to \nthe list of reporting when they deny something, or are we looking at having them report if \nthey have denied a mental health service?  Do they have to disclose if that was not part of \ntheir original insurance contract?  I am trying to clarify what they would have to report. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nThe language in the original bill was much more prescriptive than intended.  At this time, the \nintention is to get a general baseline for what those parity metrics are in existing insurance \ncoverage.  One difficulty is that the interpretation of parity is inconsistent.  In Nevada, we \nwant to see what parity metrics are being met by these individual insurance companies in \norder to see the picture that patients are in.  As you said, are they being denied service \nbecause of insurance coverage and whether that is equitable or not or inconsistent with \nindustry parity.  The revisions to this section would allow the Division of Insurance to \npromulgate regulations requiring that data collection piece, but not necessarily create the \nenforcement mechanisms you are describing that would be a blessing to this industry.  That is \none of the biggest complaints I hear:  \"I need the service but I cannot get it.  My insurance \nwill not cover it.  It is too expensive on my own, or my child has special needs and I need \nthem to be in this facility rather than in this other facility, but I cannot get there because I am \nforced to go here.\"  Those kinds of issues will come at a later time once we have a better idea \nwhat those parity metrics will look like. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 8, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nMy  question  concerns  the  amendment  and  legislative  intent.    This  would  change  from \nNevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 449 to NRS Chapter 441A.  As I read this, the intent \nis reporting on suicide attempts and suicide completions specific to opioids because that \nchapter is concerned with infectious disease and reporting on opioids.  I imagine you are not \njust looking for that, but having it in the communicable disease chapter feels as though it is \nbeing narrowed.  I imagine you would still want to know about a person presenting in the ER \nwith a single gunshot wound to the head and those kinds of suicides.  For the record, spell out \nwhy NRS Chapter 441A is the best place to house this language. \n \nStephanie Woodard: \nNevada Revised Statutes Chapter 441A includes all communicable diseases to be reported as \nwell as overdoses from Assembly Bill 474 of the 79th Session.  This would also allow us to \ncollect and analyze that data as it relates to suicide.  When it comes to behavioral health, we \ndo not have the statutory authority to establish these kinds of reporting regulations, so we \nhave to look to established authority within the public health side.  Nevada Revised Statutes \nChapter 441A has been the area of existing statute that seems to fit best when we are looking \nat collecting population health data like this. \n \nKyra  Morgan,  Chief  Biostatistician,  Division  of  Public  and  Behavioral  Health, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services: \nNevada Revised Statutes Chapter 441A is also where we have all our real-time reportable \nconditions that require individual follow-up.  By placing the overdose regulations there, the \nidea was that those were cases that potentially would require that really quick follow-up by a \ndisease investigator.  We wanted to mirror the regulation for suicide reporting to be similar to \noverdose reporting so that if we wanted to have that real-time communication with disease \ninvestigation, it would fall in line with how we do that for communicable diseases.  \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nRight now, you are able to extrapolate the data, but you have to do it in an indirect way, so \nthe goal is to make sure you are getting the data much more quickly.  Could you talk about \nthe difference between the status quo and the information you get—which is taking six \nmonths to a year—versus your goal for this legislation which would be to get it in days, \nweeks, or months?  Would you clarify that? \n \nStephanie Woodard: \nWe currently have billing and claims data, so there is a dataset that pulls all the emergency \nroom and hospital billing claims.  That dataset typically has a 90- to 120-day lag.  As Kyra \nMorgan mentioned, this allows us to do some of that follow-up.  We hope we will be able to \nget this data in a much more timely way than looking at three to four months out.  Exactly \nwhat that time period is would need to be determined during the regulatory development \nprocess.  That is where we will be engaging with stakeholders to figure out what a reasonable \ntime frame would be for us to expect to get this data. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 8, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nFor the record, right now, you are looking for when a provider has a known interaction with a \nperson and knows that person attempted or completed suicide.  You mean this to be different \nfrom what CMS [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services] and The Joint Commission \nhave right now around sentinel events and those kinds of suicides, right? \n \nStephanie Woodard: \nYes, we are not seeking to find information related to sentinel events.  We are looking to \nidentify individuals who are presenting for care in an emergency room related to a suicide \nattempt. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThere was an amendment by Mr. Tom Clark that is considered unfriendly at this time.  Do \nyou have an update on that? \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nI had an opportunity to talk to Mr. Clark and let him know that we were working with the \nDivision of Insurance on an amendment to address their concerns.  We will continue to work \nwith them as stakeholders on that process to ensure that we are preparing something that is \nbeneficial to Nevada.  Hopefully, we can get to a neutral place with them. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIt looks as though all the conceptual amendments Assemblywoman Peters referenced are \nnow uploaded to NELIS under \"Exhibits.\"  Are there further questions? \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI think it is important to talk about section 7 and going forward into the bill, but it makes the \nmost sense to see what those amendments will look like and how the bill will read.   \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nYes, we are essentially gutting those sections, so asking questions about the language as it is \nwritten today would not be helpful.  I have the Division of Insurance's proposed amendment \nlanguage.  It just showed in my email box, so I will have a chance to review it.  I will send it \naround to the Committee when it is ready.  I apologize for the delay, but we want to make \nsure that we are getting it right, especially in light of recent federal legislation.  We want to \nmake sure we are not duplicating any efforts. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI appreciate that and look forward to seeing what the conversation will be. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there further questions? \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 8, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nThere has been discussion about various modes to share this data.  Has there been any \ndiscussion about a singular software or singular data entry area where the data can be input, \neveryone can use it, and then it could be more easily extrapolated?  Is that part of this \ndiscussion?  Is there a possibility for there to be a private industry software or portal that \ncould be shared across the different providers that would help facilitate this more quickly? \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nThis bill does not address that issue.  However, I know the Department of Health and Human \nServices (DHHS) has been working with stakeholders, including the hospitals, on how to \nmake that line of data be as streamlined as possible so we are not creating an overburden on \none side or the other.  One of the advantages to creating a kind of raw database is that you \ncan assimilate that data in a variety of ways.  I believe that is being discussed in other areas \nand was presented through the Patient Protection Commission or the Interim Legislative \nCommittee on Health Care; however, that is not a piece of what we are talking about today. \n \nStephanie Woodard: \nThere are three different ways hospitals can currently report, and we do not have a preference \neither way.  We want to make it as least burdensome as possible.  For those organizations \nthat would prefer to use a manual-input database, we do have an overdose reporting database \nthat is being reengineered to be able to collect all the data related to A.B. 181.  Providers can \nalso fax a report or they can do a data extract.  The data extract seems to be the least \nburdensome because it will allow that data to be pulled directly from their electronic health \nrecord and then be batched in a data file that can then be analyzed by DHHS.  We are open to \nother solutions, but as you mentioned, most other solutions would require some additional \nfunding in order for us to be able to create a singular data repository. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nI assume whether someone is reporting with a faxed document, or using the data extract, or \nthe third option, data input, the questions, the answers, the data, is all consistent no matter \nwhat.  When that data goes in, it is the same at the end, and you can then extrapolate that data \nto get the most accurate answers.  Am I correct? \n \nStephanie Woodard: \nYes, regardless of the way the data is provided to DHHS, that data is reviewed and cleaned \nand then put into a file where the data can then be analyzed. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nI appreciate the information.  All of us are really concerned about mental health right now.  \nI am seeing more discussions about mental health crises, whether they are connected with \nsubstance abuse or just in general in the African-American community, than I have ever seen \nbefore.  In primetime television, we are seeing examples of folks seeking help, and they are \nmaking it normal and okay for folks in our community.  There has been such a stigma about \nmental health issues.  Anything we can do to help people find a way to get help is really \nimportant.  I do not know how you speed up the process; I am sure you are working on that, \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 8, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nand I hope this legislation will help you do that.  I am looking forward to reading all the \namendments, and I appreciate you, Assemblywoman Peters, for bringing this forward. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nThank you.  This is a really important issue, and something that touches all of us, whether \ndirectly or through friends and family who have looked for services or who have been in the \nweb of mental health care in Nevada.  The Department of Health and Human Services has \nbeen putting a huge amount of work into the idea of destigmatizing mental health services \nand those needs.  It is a work in progress because it is not just patient-based; that stigma even \nincludes the providers—even identifying and acknowledging that someone may or may not \nneed those services has created stigmas in reporting.  Trying to break down those barriers is a \npiece of this puzzle.  The more we talk about it openly, the more we see it actively, and the \nmore we hold folks accountable who may be the bottlenecks in this area, the better off our \ncommunities will be.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe will start taking testimony in support, opposition, and neutral.  Please remember to \nclearly state and spell your name and limit your testimony to two minutes.  We will begin \nwith support testimony. \n \nLisa  Durette,  Assistant  Professor  and  Fellowship  Director,  Child  and  Adolescent \nPsychiatry and Behavioral Health, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, School of \nMedicine: \nI am a child and adolescent psychiatrist and run the training program at the University of \nNevada, Las Vegas's School of Medicine.  This whole bill has a lot of positives, but I want to \nspeak about the importance of parity, especially as it pertains to the kids who are really \nstruggling in our state.  A recent report from the Milliman Institute shows that a child's \nmental health office visit is 10.1 or 1,000 percent times more likely to be out-of-network than \na primary care office visit, which is twice as much as a mental health office visit for an adult.  \nFurthermore, children's utilization of inpatient and outpatient facilities are 500 percent more \nlikely to face out-of-network charges for behavioral health care than medical or surgical care.  \nAdditionally, spending for mental health care has not shifted and makes up only 2.4 percent \nof the overall health care expense.  This is why it is so crucial that we have parity so children \nhave equal access to mental health care as they do for physical health care access.   \n \nOur  state  currently  ranks  fifty-first  in  the  nation  for  children's  mental  health  services, \naccording to Mental Health America (MHA).  The fact that we lack parity through many of \nour insurers in this state is a crucial reason for which kids are not able to access timely care \nthat they need which is critical at this time of the COVID-19 crisis—where we have seen our \nsuicide rates in children as young as eight spiking in our cities and where we see high school \nfailure and dropout at a higher rate than ever.  We are in an enormous crisis and by having \nparity we will be able to get access to mental health care just like for cancer care, surgical \ncare, and every other element of health care.   \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 8, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nRobin Reedy, Executive Director, National Alliance on Mental Illness Nevada: \nOn behalf of NAMI Nevada, the state chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, \nI would like to offer our support on the provision in A.B. 181 that addresses an issue of \nextraordinary  significance  to  Nevadans—parity  of  health  insurance  coverage  for  mental \nhealth and substance use conditions.  Because of current parity challenges, the disparities are \nglaring.  In 2015, individuals in Nevada received outpatient behavioral health care out of \nnetwork at a rate 3.21 times higher than primary care services, and 3.81 times higher than \nspecialists for other health conditions.  For individuals receiving inpatient behavioral health \ncare out of network, the rate is 6.05 times higher than for other inpatient services.  This \nmeans that Nevadans with mental illness cannot access or afford the care they deserve.  \nWhen people with a mental health condition cannot access affordable mental health care, \nthere is a steep personal cost that delays individuals being able to get well.  There are also \nsignificant costs for the state.  When Nevadans cannot get appropriate care, the state faces \nincreased health care and other costs, from higher numbers of individuals ending up in jail, \nemergency departments, and on the streets, rather than getting the help they need.  NAMI \nNevada  strongly  supports  the  parity  provision  in  A.B.  181,  which would  ensure  health \ninsurance compliance with state and federal parity laws.  State and federal law mandates that \nmental health insurance coverage cannot be treated any differently than medical coverage, \nand A.B. 181 would help to make parity a reality for the many individuals and families in the \nstate who need access to affordable mental health treatment.  The people of Nevada deserve \nthe opportunity to experience health and productivity.  In support of this goal, NAMI Nevada \nurges public policy that ensures that all people have access to the right treatments at the right \ntime.  For this reason, we urge the Committee to support parity coverage for mental health \nand substance use conditions. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI would like to remind callers on the line to please limit your testimony to two minutes.  You \nalways have the opportunity to submit written comments including any you might have read \nduring your testimony.  May we go to the next caller in support, please. \n \nDan Musgrove, Chair, Clark County Children's Mental Health Consortium: \n[Dan  Musgrove  submitted  a  copy  of  a  letter  to  Barbara  Richardson,  Commissioner  of \nInsurance, Department of Business and Industry Exhibit F].   I want to echo the comments of \nDr. Lisa Durette, a former member of our consortium, as they relate to parity, especially for \nchildren's mental health.  She referenced the Mental Health America report that puts Nevada \nfifty-first for youth mental health.  One of the seven measures MHA used is children with \nprivate health insurance that does not cover mental or emotional problems.  For this measure, \nNevada ranks forty-fifth, with an average of 12.6 percent—or 13,000 children—not having \nmental or emotional health care coverage.  That is shocking and tragic.  On NELIS is a copy \nof a letter our consortium wrote to Barbara Richardson, Commissioner of Insurance, on \nFebruary 17, about a week or so before this bill was introduced.  We applaud the sponsor of \nthe bill and her attempts to get information about what is covered by insurance plans.  We \nknow  there  are  a  lot  of  plans  that  do  not  cover  those  mental  and  emotional  problems \nDr. Durette talked about.  These are not items parents can afford, so we applaud the intent of \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 8, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nthis bill.  We will want to see how the amendments come out, but anything that can be done \nto understand what those essential benefits for children's health care is absolutely necessary. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWith no more callers in support, we will go to callers in opposition to A.B. 181. \n \nTom Clark, representing Nevada Association of Health Plans: \nAs was mentioned earlier, we have put forward an amendment, but based on the conceptual \namendment Assemblywoman Peters has brought forward and the dialogue that is taking \nplace with the Insurance Commissioner, our amendment may be moot.  We look forward to \nworking with the bill's sponsors, with the Commissioner, and all the other stakeholders to \nfigure out primarily the areas around section 9. \n \nTray Abney, representing America's Health Insurance Plans: \nWe categorize our opposition to the bill as written as friendly.  I would like to say ditto to \nTom Clark's comments.  Our main concern relates to a new federal law that was passed in \nJanuary which already requires all the reporting foreseen in this bill.  We were worried about \nduplication of efforts, but we had a very positive conversation with Assemblywoman Peters \nthis morning.  We are dedicated to working with her and the Division of Insurance to craft a \nsolution that everyone is satisfied with.  We look forward to seeing the bill with amendments.  \nAgain, I want to thank the bill's sponsor for working with us. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any other callers in opposition?  [There were none.]  I will close opposition \ntestimony.  Do we have any callers in neutral?  [There were none.]  With that, I will close \ntestimony and ask Assemblywoman Peters for any remarks she would like to make. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nI want to acknowledge how many heads it has taken to get this piece of legislation to where it \nis today.  It is a patient-centric piece of legislation related to mental health care and access.  \nI would especially like to thank Dr. Stephanie Woodard and the Division of Public and \nBehavioral Health  for bringing their  part  of  this  piece  of  legislation  and  working  with \nstakeholders  on  the  amendment.    Additionally,  thank  you  to  the  Nevada  Psychiatric \nAssociation for bringing the other piece of this legislation.  I want to also thank the Division \nof Insurance and Commissioner Richardson for working with me and other stakeholders on \nthe pending amendment, and thank you, Committee, for hearing this important piece of \nlegislation.  I hope I can earn your support as we work on these final amendments. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI know we have been trying to work on this type of legislation for the better part of at least \nfive years that I am aware of.  With that, I will close the hearing on A.B. 181 and open the \nhearing on Assembly Bill 191.   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 8, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nAssembly Bill 191:  Requires the State Plan for Medicaid to include coverage for the \nservices  of  a  community  health  worker  under  certain  circumstances. \n(BDR 38-449) \n \nAssemblyman David Orentlicher, Assembly District No. 20: \nAssembly  Bill  191  is  sponsored  by  the  Legislative  Committee  on  Health  Care,  which \nconsidered a variety of public health issues during the 2019-2020 Interim.  I was not a \nmember of that Committee; however, Assemblywoman Cohen invited me to carry this bill \nthis session, and I am honored to present it before you.  This is a simple bill based on a very \nimportant principle:  an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  If we invest a small \namount in public health efforts, we will not need to spend nearly as much on the treatment of \ndisease.  People will be much healthier and more productive.  This bill will make sure our \nMedicaid program funds some of the very important services that community health workers \n(CHWs)  deliver  to  promote  the  well-being  of  Nevadans.    We  are  joined  today  by \nrepresentatives of community health workers who will provide more information about why \nthis bill is so valuable.  In addition, DuAne Young from the Department of Health and \nHuman Services will provide the agency's perspective. \n \nSteve Messinger, Policy Director, Nevada Primary Care Association: \nI would like to hand this over to Jay Kolbet-Clausell for his presentation. \n \nJay  Kolbet-Clausell,  Program  Manager,  Nevada  Community  Health  Worker \nAssociation:     \nI am proud to see our state supporting community health workers.  [Jay Kolbet-Clausell \npresented a PowerPoint Exhibit G as well as supplemental information Exhibit H].  Building \na healthy community is like constructing a sound home [page 2, Exhibit G].  State leadership \noversees skilled professionals who design systems, assemble resources, and assess needs.  \nWe will liberate costly resources when we equip providers to hire the CHW workforce.  \nLike architects, doctors and nurses should not be tied up in follow-through when trained \ncraftspeople  can  cut  the  tile  or  ensure  that  patients  make  progress  on  their  health.  \nCommunity health workers are community members who bridge the gaps in Nevada's health \ncare system [page 3].  They come from rural and urban communities, so they represent the \ndiversity of our state.  Nevada ranks fiftieth in primary care providers according to the \nAmerica's  Health  Rankings  in  2020  [page  4].    Nevada  began  to  address  our  health \nprofessional shortage by creating CHW training and certification.  Using community health \nworkers started 20 years ago in Texas and it has grown to include all but three states.  \nIn Nevada,  this  work  has  been  going  on  since  2014  when  the  Division  of  Public  and \nBehavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services, piloted the program.  Nearly \n700 students completed CHW training through our association, and we work closely with the \nother two training schools in Reno and Las Vegas. \n \nCommunity health workers have shared training [page 5] and they also specialize to meet the \nspecific needs of each community.  While one sets tile, another frames the structure.  You \ncan expect to see community health workers go by many names and serve in many different \nroles to meet the needs of each clinic.   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 8, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nMinority and rural communities are underrepresented in health care workforce education.  \nThe  CHW  model  creates  leaders  in  those  communities  and  provides  opportunities  for \nprofessional advancement.  Community health workers become social workers, nurses, and \ndoctors who are more likely to return to the communities where they grew up [page 6].  The \nDivision of Public and Behavioral Health found a $2 savings for every $1 spent [page 7].  \nEmergency room visits decreased by 14 percent, urgent care by 6 percent, acute admits by \n18 percent, and repeat hospital visits reduced 20 percent.   \n \nSteve Messinger: \nSection 1 of this bill requires the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services \nto include in the State Plan for Medicaid \"the services of a community health worker who \nprovides  services  under  the supervision  of  a physician,  physician  assistant  or  advanced \npractice registered nurse.\"  Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that \nthe provisions of section 1 will be administered in the same manner as the provisions of \nexisting law governing the State Plan for Medicaid. \n \nThis bill relies on the definition of a community health worker established by Senate Bill 498 \nof the 78th Session.  This definition in Nevada Revised Statutes 449.0027 is a natural person \nwho:  \n \n1.  Lives in or otherwise has a connection to the community in which he \nor she provides services.  \n2.  Is trained by a provider of health care to provide certain services \nwhich do not require the community health worker to be licensed. \n3.  Provides  services  at  the  direction  of  a  facility  for  the  dependent, \nmedical facility or provider of health care which may include, without \nlimitation, outreach and the coordination of health care. \n \nKelly Bumgarner, Director of Health Policy, Children's Advocacy Alliance: \nOur organization is proud to participate in the Strong Start Nevada initiative, working to \ncreate a statewide plan to connect pregnant moms, families, and children to service providers \nthat support and enhance quality child care, education, and obstetric and pediatric care.  \nCommunity health workers are an essential part of the Strong Start plan [page 9, Exhibit G].  \nThe Strong Start initiative is championed by a coalition of over 25 stakeholder groups \nincluding  clinicians,  local  and  state  governmental  institutions,  nonprofits,  and  parents.  \nTogether, we have developed a plan that relies upon CHWs to connect some of our most \nvulnerable and underserved residents to vital services and care.  Our collaborative agrees that \nCHWs are the key to strengthening supports, and ultimately, families, in Nevada [page 10]. \n \nCommunity health workers meet with families in culturally competent and convenient ways \nin places like their child care centers, schools, or own homes to provide education on services \nand resources.  For example, over 60,000 Nevada children are currently uninsured; however, \nwe estimate that over half of those children qualify for Medicaid or CHIP [Children's Health \nInsurance Program].  Community health workers inform families of available programs and \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 8, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nhow to access them in a way that makes them feel both comfortable and empowered.  Our \ncollaborative believes that CHWs are critical to bridging program coverage gaps [page 11]. \n \nSteve Messinger: \nMy association, the Nevada Primary Care Association, represents the Federally Qualified \nHealth Centers (FQHCs) in the state.  We have used CHWs in various ways over the past \nyears, mostly because these are not reimbursed services through grant programs [page 12].  \nOne program was funded through the Division of Public and Behavioral Health and it went \nto ensure that colorectal-cancer-screening rates were improved in FQHCs.  That grant went \nto fund a position for a person to call these folks to remind them and encourage them to take \nthese cancer screens.  If this bill were to pass, those services would now be Medicaid-\nreimbursable.  We like to think all the money we have spent on grant-funded CHWs over the \nyears, how much further those grant dollars could have gone with the program this bill \nenvisions.    In  addition  to  colorectal-cancer-screening  CHWs,  we  also  have  diabetes \neducators, asthma risk evaluation—going into the home and evaluating what might trigger \nasthma and educating those patients about how to clean that up.  We have cultural and \nlinguistic interpretations, so sometimes CHWs are visiting a provider with their clients in \norder to make sure care is delivered in a language the person speaks but also in a way that \ncan be understood.   \n \nThis past year, with the rapid expansion of telehealth, we have found that a lot of our patients \ndo not have the ability to access technology, or they have the technology but not the skills to \naccess it.  Sending CHWs is a very efficient way to get them connected to their provider \nremotely, where that is appropriate.  Our association also has a lot of family planning—we \nhave two grants, teen pregnancy prevention and a Title X family planning grant.  Community \nhealth workers are very effective for engaging those populations—teenagers for the teen \npregnancy and women of childbearing age for the Title X.  The point here is that these are \nservices currently being provided in Nevada.  They would go much further if we made a \nsmall investment now. \n \nDuAne Young, Deputy Administrator, Division of Health Care Financing and Policy, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services: \nWe are grateful to Assemblyman Orentlicher for providing us with the opportunity to speak \ntoday on behalf of the Division, as this bill directly impacts Medicaid.  This is a medical-\nmodel program.  My colleagues have done an excellent job explaining how that works in a \nchronic disease model.  This is definitely a needed service within the state.  This year, the \nDivision  was  able  to  take  some  of  those  return-on-investment  studies  as  well  as  other \nacademic articles and apply them to a conservative estimate of savings so there is not a fiscal \nnote.  In fact, there is a projected savings that we would see.  It goes without saying during \nthe COVID-19 pandemic that having these types of services with those CHWs and agencies \nand FQHCs that had grants to use them have found them to be invaluable to the efforts of \nhelping to protect Nevadans. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo you have any final comments, Assemblyman Orentlicher? \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 8, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nI  want  to  thank  my  copresenters  for  doing  a  very  nice  job  laying  out  the  issues,  and \nI appreciate your time. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you for stepping in and presenting this bill even though you did not do the work \nduring the interim.  We appreciate you stepping up and making your first bill presentation. \nI have asked our policy analyst to send some links to Committee members.  As you heard, \nthis was a policy recommendation from the interim committee work, so if you want to review \nany of the policy conversations that took place during the interim, you would be able to do \nso. \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nCould someone explain the differences between a community health worker versus a medical \nassistant and what responsibilities and duties those two professions would perform versus \nother members of a medical team? \n \nDuAne Young: \nFrom a Medicaid billing perspective model, medical assistants are not enrolled separately.  \nThey  facilitate  the  appointment  through  assisting  the  doctor  with  medical  issues.    The \ncommunity health worker's job is promotion of education, training, outreach, and linkage.  It \nis also very different from what we would have through targeted case management.  That is a \ndifferent service as well as peer-to-peer counseling.  This is more of a direct educational role \nwith the patients as opposed to actually assisting the doctor. \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nThank you for the clarification.  They are very distinctive roles and used for very different \nresponsibilities and they are both very important, so I appreciate you clarifying that on the \nrecord. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nAssemblyman Orentlicher, that was one of the best presentations I have seen on a bill, \nespecially since you did not own this bill to start with.  My question is in regard to the billing \nprocess.  Section 1, subsection 1, lists the people you have identified who can order a \ncommunity health worker to see a patient.  I appreciate that you have included the physician \nassistants (PAs) and advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs).  When I have introduced \nbills, I made certain that the language was all inclusive as concerns the providers.  My \nquestion revolves around the billing process.  Is it a national standard that community health \nworkers are assigned national provider identifier (NPI) numbers?  We all have to have an \nNPI number in order to bill, or would the billing be under the PA, APRN, or the physician's \nNPI?  Are you looking at all CHWs getting NPI numbers? \n \nDuAne Young: \nSince we have matured in our philosophy and approach to this, we are looking to have them \nenroll separately and this would be a new provider type under their own NPI.  Part of the \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 8, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nreason for that is because they will be utilized in some of our cost-based providers such as \nrural health clinics and FQHCs.  This would allow us to track the data better and know what \nservices are being provided under those different models by these providers. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI am happy to hear that because I think that is what needs to happen. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIs there anyone else who has questions?  [There was no reply.]  I will now go to testimony in \nsupport of A.B. 191.   \n \nKatie Ryan, System Director, Nevada Government Relations, Dignity Health-St. Rose \nDominican: \n[Katie Ryan also provided a letter in support Exhibit I].  I want to say how grateful we are to \nthe interim Legislative Committee on Health Care that they took up this issue.  During \nnormal  circumstances,  Dignity  Health-St.  Rose  Dominican  has  CHWs  out  in  the \ncommunities where they are needed most, giving classes in both English and Spanish on a \nnumber of important public health topics and diseases.  Going directly to these populations \nand helping them where they are is such an important part of health equity.  During the \npandemic, we have been doing a lot of this virtually, but we are really looking forward to \ngetting back to our full schedule once we are closer to herd immunity. \n \nHiley Dobbs, Private Citizen, Reno, Nevada: \n[Hiley Dobbs submitted a document in support Exhibit J].  I am a graduate student studying \npublic health and a member of the Rural Nevada Health Network.  As both a student and a \nfuture health care professional, I support this bill expanding access to community health \nworkers through Medicaid reimbursement.  Community health workers are trusted, culturally \ncompetent,  cost-effective,  trained,  and  certified  professionals  who  work  in  a  variety  of \nsettings under different titles—in schools as resource coordinators, in health centers as care \ncoordinators, or in treatment centers, food banks, and tribal health centers.  The services \nprovided do not replace those of licensed health care providers but rather potentially prevent \ncostly services and allow higher-level services such as ambulances and emergency rooms to \noperate at the top of their scopes. \n \nNot only does passage of this bill improve the health of rural Nevadans, and all Nevadans, \nand minimize costs incurred, but it can also support job growth as medical centers that are \nalready billing Medicaid would be able to hire community health workers.  While change is \ndifficult, it is critical to improve outcomes and reduce costs. \n \nErik Schoen, Executive Director, Community Chest, Inc.: \n[Erik Schoen submitted a letter in support Exhibit K].  As the executive director of a \nnonprofit agency that has provided complementary health and human services across many \nrural Nevada counties for the past 30 years, I have seen firsthand the immense benefit that \ncan come from utilizing community health workers who are from the communities that they \nare  serving.    Not  only  are  they  able  to  leverage  their  specific  cultural  expertise  and \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 8, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nrelationships for the benefit of others, they are also often able to do so at a much more \naffordable cost than other alternatives. \n \nOur Resilient 8 Coalition, a demonstration project that has been federally funded for more \nthan two years, has utilized community health workers as a primary services delivery strategy \nacross eight rural Nevada counties.  They have been able to work with inmates in at least two \ncounties to develop robust release plans and linkages to needed services, provided dozens of \ntrainings on the uses of naloxone, taken the lead in developing strategic plans for each of the \ncounties to develop needed health and human service capacity, and more. \n \nAs well, I am also a licensed clinical professional counselor and as such, would like to plant \na possible seed for enhancing A.B. 191.  Because doctors, nurses, and social workers are in \nshort supply everywhere, especially rural Nevada, and because the responsibility frequently \nfalls on these three professions, consider expanding the pool of acceptable supervisors for \nCHWs to include other professions that already make it a practice to provide continuous \nsupervision, including psychologists, school psychologists, clinical professional counselors, \nmarriage and family therapists, and licensed clinical drug and alcohol counselors.  This will \nhelp to support CHWs being able to work in a variety of nontraditional settings such as \nschools, nonprofit health and human services providers, and more. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nYou made recommendations that you wanted changes to A.B. 191.  If that is the case, \nI would have to recategorize you as opposition testimony, but do you support the bill as it is \nwritten? \n \nErik Schoen: \nI do support the bill as it is written. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nCould we go to the next caller, please? \n \nNoel Chounet, Private Citizen, Silver Springs, Nevada: \nI am a community health worker in Silver Springs, and I have seen firsthand the positive \neffects that community health workers can have on our community members helping with the \ntelehealth appointments, bridging that gap between providers and patients, and improving the \nhealth of clients and helping them to reach their goals.  I do support this bill.  After this \nfoundation is built, it would be wonderful if we could expand it in the future to include other \nhealth care professionals as oversight for the CHWs to make this an even more flexible \nprogram, as we do work in a lot of nontraditional environments, but it is a wonderful start \nand I am looking forward to seeing where this takes us as we work to improve the health of \nour community and expand access. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI want to be clear.  I know people want to go further and continue the conversation, but just \nfor clarification, you are in support of the bill as written?  \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 8, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nNoel Chounet: \nCorrect.  I am in support of the bill as written. \n \nAlex Bybee, Director of Strategic Partnerships, Communities In Schools of Nevada: \nWe are in support of A.B. 191.  Communities In Schools of Nevada is the fifth-largest state \noffice of the nation's leading evidence-based dropout prevention organization and we operate \nin the Clark, Elko, Humboldt, and Washoe County school districts.  We have submitted a \nletter for the Committee, but I would like to highlight three reasons why the organization is \nsupporting A.B. 191.  Assembly Bill 191 will expand reimbursement of services provided by \ncommunity health workers and that will enable a larger workforce of support for students and \nfamilies in need.  Second, it increases access to and knowledge about health care which is \nessential to increasing the overall well-being for Nevada's families, particularly for those \nliving in poverty and experiencing other adverse circumstances.  Finally, health care and \nsocial and emotional support have a direct nexus to academic achievement and are critical \nparts of a child's holistic development, and more community health workers being able to \nprovide services and a bridge to care for these families will have an impact on school \nimprovement and academic success.  We have submitted a letter of support for the record \nthat further elaborates why our organization does support A.B. 191 [Exhibit L]. \n \nTrey Delap, Director, Group Six Partners: \nWe are in support of A.B. 191.  I had the privilege of instructing the first community health \nworker course at the College of Southern Nevada in the workforce development division.  \nNevada is catching up with valuing nonclinical supports with this bill.  When we work with \ncommunity health workers, the first competency of a CHW is individual connection with the \ncommunities they serve.  This requires that they are sourced from the community they are \ngoing to serve and are acutely aware of the resources that are available and accessible in \nthose communities.  Most often, CHWs are addressing issues of justice in health care, access, \nand equity.  They also are critical to improving and addressing social determinants of health \nand are perfect adjuncts to a clinical team for a holistic method of care.  Dr. Andrew Taylor \nStill, the founder of osteopathy, said that to find health should be the object of the doctor.  \nAnyone can find disease.  It is this competency in connection to the community that gives \nCHWs a boost in their ability to help patients become advocates for their own health and \nultimately realize good outcomes.  This is a great step forward for the state of Nevada and \nI urge your support of A.B. 191. \n \nAlisa Howard, Principal, Minority Health Consultants, Las Vegas, Nevada: \nI am currently a community health worker instructor for the College of Southern Nevada, but \nI am speaking on behalf of my own company where I do hire CHWs.  Community health \nworkers are the bridge to social determinants of health—to bridging those gaps in our \ncommunities.  Governor Sisolak has declared racism as a public health issue.  How we can \nutilize CHWs with this issue is by helping, by hiring, supporting, and by paying CHWs—\npeople who have come from the actual community who are experiencing these disparities, \npeople who have the cultural competence of these disparities, people who have the cultural \ncompetence of their culture, of their race, of their people—people who can speak directly to \nhealth issues and health disparities in our state.   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 8, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nI have been teaching community health work for the past three years and I am very excited \nabout this bill.  I would appreciate it if everyone could get on board with supporting CHWs.  \nI also sit on the policy board of NACHW, the National Association of Community Health \nWorkers and we are discussing, nationwide, how to get policies implemented for community \nhealth work.  There are lots of people on these calls in other states, people who have been \ndoing this work for a lot more time than we have—20 or 30 years.  They have given advice \non how we can use CHWs and how we can get them paid through Medicaid reimbursement, \nso I am available to anyone who may need that information after this call. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you, and I am sure the sponsor and the Committee appreciate everyone's willingness \nto have these conversations.  May we have the next caller in support?  [There was no one.]  \nWith that, I will close testimony in support.  We will now go to testimony in opposition to \nA.B. 191.  [There was none.]  Is there anyone in neutral?  [There was no one.] \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher, do you have any closing remarks? \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nI want to thank the interim Legislative Committee on Health Care for their hard work in \nproducing this excellent bill and to my copresenters for providing their testimony.  We often \nthink that to improve health quality we have to spend more.  Sometimes, we can get better \nquality at lower cost, and this is one of the important examples of that.  I appreciate your \nconsideration and I hope we can move this bill forward. \n \n[Exhibit M was submitted but not discussed and will become part of the record.] \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 191.   \n \nCommittee  members,  we  have  two  bill  draft  requests  (BDRs)  that  require  Committee \nintroduction.  We can introduce them both at once and take one vote, so I will do that at this \ntime.    Please  note  that  voting  in  favor  of  introducing  the  BDRs  from  these  interim \ncommittees does not imply a commitment to support the measure later.  This action allows \nthe BDR to become a bill and then it will be referred to the Committee for possible hearing \nafter introduction on the floor. \n \nThe two BDRs for introduction today are BDR 38-385 which requires Medicaid to cover \ncertain services for persons with cognitive impairment.  Additionally, we have BDR 40-454 \nwhich requires training for unlicensed caregivers at certain facilities.   \n \nBDR 38-385—Requires Medicaid to cover certain services for persons with a cognitive \nimpairment.  (Later introduced as Assembly Bill 216.) \n \nBDR  40-454—Requires  training  for  unlicensed  caregivers  at  certain  facilities.    (Later \nintroduced as Assembly Bill 217.) \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 8, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nDo I have a motion to introduce both BDR 38-385 and BDR 40-454? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  TITUS  MADE  A  MOTION  TO  INTRODUCE \nBDR 38-385 AND BDR 40-454. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN GORELOW SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nIs there any discussion?  [There was none.] \n \nTHE MOTION PASSED.  (ASSEMBLYWOMAN BENITEZ-THOMPSON \nWAS ABSENT FOR THE VOTE.) \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAt this time, we will begin public comment.

The Chair reminded Committee members, witnesses, and members of the \naudience of Committee rules, protocol, and procedures for virtual meetings.]  I will now open \nup the hearing on Assembly Bill 189.  We introduced a committee bill that came out of the \n2019-2020 Interim Legislative Committee on Health Care and we have decided that bill \n[Assembly Bill 193] and A.B. 189 are very similar, so you will see amendments already \nsubmitted by Assemblywoman Gorelow on the Nevada Electronic Legislative Information \nSystem.  Rather than hear the same bill twice, we are probably going to incorporate that \nlanguage and work that took place during the interim into A.B. 189. \n \nAssembly Bill 189:  Establishes presumptive Medicaid eligibility for certain pregnant \nwomen. (BDR 38-130) \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 10, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nAssemblywoman Michelle Gorelow, Assembly District No. 35: \nI am a member of the Nevada Statewide Maternal and Child Health Coalition steering \ncommittee and I am the immediate past chair of the Southern Nevada Maternal and Child \nHealth Coalition and immediate past cochair of the Statewide Maternal and Child Health \nCoalition.  I served as a member of the National Governors Association Learning Network \non Improving Birth Outcomes under Governor Sandoval, and I was part of the Nevada \ndelegation to attend the Collaborative Improvement and Innovation Network to Reduce Fetal \nMortality. \n \nAssembly Bill 189 is about improving access to health care for pregnant women because we \nknow that healthier moms mean healthier babies and lower costs for everyone.  As Chair \nNguyen mentioned, we will be including an amendment that is going to include all of \nAssembly Bill 193 [Exhibit C].  \n \nWe have heard in this Committee that maternal mortality and morbidity are significant \nproblems in the United States and in Nevada.  The U.S. has one of the highest maternal \nmortality rates among developed countries, and Nevada is no exception, with 129 pregnancy-\nassociated deaths between 2015 and 2019. \n \nAnother significant issue is preterm birth.  A \"preterm birth\" is defined as any birth before \n37 completed weeks of gestation.  The reason we use 37 weeks even though 40 weeks is \nconsidered to be full-term is because we can be off on a due date for a pregnant mom by \nabout 2 weeks.  Thirty-seven weeks of gestation could actually be a 39-week gestation. \n \nA preterm birth is divided into three categories based on gestational age: \n \n•  Extremely preterm babies that are born earlier than 28 weeks. \n•  Very preterm babies that are born between 28 and 32 weeks. \n•  Moderate or late preterm babies that are born between 32 and 37 weeks. \n \nEach year in Nevada we have around 3,800 preterm births.  The highest I remember seeing \nover the last 15 years was 5,400 births, so we have done a really good job reducing those \npreterm births.  However, our preterm birth rate is still 10.7 percent, so the March of Dimes \ngives us a D+ on its annual report card.   \n \nThe vast majority of preterm births, or about 85 percent, are moderate or late preterm—that \nis, born between 32 and 37 weeks of gestation, followed by about 9 percent being very \npreterm and about 6 percent being extremely preterm births. \n \nWhen looking at the preterm birth rate and breaking it down to race and ethnicity, African-\nAmerican women have the highest at 13.7 percent, Native-American women are second at \n12.1 percent, Asian women are at 11 percent, and Hispanic and Caucasian women are about \n9.6 percent and 9.8 percent, respectively. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 10, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nPreterm birth and low birth weight are associated with significant economic, medical, and \nsocial costs as well.  Preterm birth is not only the leading cause of neonatal mortality; it is \nalso associated with short- and long-term disabilities and morbidities. \n \nA 2007 review by the Institute of Medicine estimated the economic burden of preterm birth \nin the United States to be at least $26.2 billion in 2005 dollars.  That averages about $51,600 \nper preterm birth.  There have been some updated calculations that average preterm births to \nbe between $65,000 and $76,000.  However, the longer the baby is in a neonatal intensive \ncare unit (NICU), the more that can be.  A baby born at about 32 weeks averages about \n$280,000 a year.  I read about triplets being born at 28 weeks.  They all spent about two \nmonths in a NICU at a cost of $4 million.   \n \nWhile cost estimates vary, studies consistently show that they are the highest for extremely \npreterm infants, and increasing gestational age by just weeks can result in significant cost \nsavings.  This is intuitive, as early preterm babies generally require the most time in the \nhospital.  In Nevada, the average length of stay for extremely preterm babies was anywhere \nfrom 54 to 78 days in recent years.  The length of stay for very preterm babies was slightly \nlower—between 49 and 53 days.  In contrast, the average length of stay for moderate or late \npreterm babies was only nine or ten days.  For a full-term infant who may only stay one or \ntwo days in the hospital, that cost is roughly $2,500 to $2,900—a huge difference.  My son, \nwho was born in 2006, spent five days in the NICU and it cost $15,000.  He was not a super \nsick baby; he had some feeding issues and some temperature control issues. \n \nWhat do we do to increase the gestational age of babies born in Nevada?  We improve \nprenatal care for moms.  Nevada Medicaid is the single largest payor of births in the state, \ncovering more than half the births statewide.  As such, it is uniquely positioned to improve \nboth maternal and child health outcomes.  Assembly Bill 189 will improve access to prenatal \ncare and other health services by extending Medicaid eligibility for pregnant women in \nNevada.  As introduced, A.B. 189 requires Medicaid to expedite enrollment for pregnant \nwomen through a policy of \"presumptive eligibility\" which allows health care providers to \nhelp women enroll in Medicaid without submitting a full application and receive early \nprenatal care.   \n \nSpecifically, the bill requires the director of the Department of Health and Human Services \n(DHHS) to include authorization in the State Plan for Medicaid for a pregnant woman to \nenroll in Medicaid if she is determined to be presumptively eligible by a qualified provider.  \nA qualified provider is an eligible entity for payment under the state's approved plan and is \ndetermined by the state to be capable of making determinations. \n \nThe period of Medicaid enrollment continues until the last day of the month after the month \nof enrollment during which a pregnant woman must submit a full Medicaid application for \ncoverage to continue.  I want to make sure this is on the record.  The idea is that the woman \ndoes not wait until the end of that second month.  We want that application to be in the \nprocess of going through while she is getting care so there is no lapse in care.  We do not \nwant her to wait until the end, and then it takes another 30 or 45 days for her to be approved.  \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 10, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nWe want that to be done while she is getting care so she can be approved and continue \nreceiving that care. \n \nThis policy was also proposed by the 2019-2020 Interim Legislative Committee on Health \nCare.  In fact, that committee voted unanimously to pursue a bill [Assembly Bill 193] that not \nonly mirrors this requirement but also expands Medicaid coverage for pregnant women in \nthree additional ways.  Because the goals of the committee's bill, A.B. 193, were very \nsimilar,  we  decided  to  combine  the  two  bills.    That  was  with  the  approval  of \nAssemblywoman Cohen, chair of the interim committee.  This means adding provisions to \nA.B. 189 to require the director of DHHS, to the extent authorized by federal law, to expand \nMedicaid coverage for pregnant women in Nevada by allowing them to enroll in Medicaid if \ntheir household income is at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL)—\n$25,760 for an individual or $53,000 for a family of four, up to the current threshold, which \nis now 165 percent.  It would also prohibit DHHS from requiring a pregnant woman who is \noverwise eligible for Medicaid to live in the United States for a certain amount of time before \nenrolling in Medicaid.  Currently, residing pregnant women who are lawful residents must \nwait five years before becoming eligible for Medicaid.  We are looking to waive that. \n \nWe are also requiring DHHS to apply for a waiver from the federal government to allow a \npregnant woman and her child to keep Medicaid coverage until 12 months after the child is \nborn so she can be taken care of during the postpartum period.  Currently, Medicaid coverage \nextends only 60 days postpartum, but the data show that 50 percent of maternal deaths occur \nafter delivery and nearly 12 percent occur six weeks postpartum, meaning that maintaining \naccess to care is critical in the year after childbirth.  The federal government is looking at \nincluding this in the federal American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.   \n \nNevada is not alone in considering or implementing any of these policies.  According to the \nKaiser Family Foundation, 42 states have higher income limits for pregnant women than \nNevada, ranging from 171 percent of the FPL in Kansas to 380 percent of FPL in Iowa.   \nThirty  states  expedite  Medicaid  enrollment  for  pregnant  women  through  presumptive \neligibility.  Twenty-five states allow lawfully residing pregnant immigrant women who are \notherwise eligible to enroll, even if they have not lived in the United States for five years, \nand states are increasingly exploring the possibility of extending Medicaid coverage for up to \n12 months postpartum. \n \nEarly prenatal care is defined as care during the first trimester, so 12 or 13 weeks of care.  \nThe U.S. average is 77.6 percent.  As of 2019, Nevada was at 75.4 percent and ranked thirty-\nseventh.  As early as 2016 we were forty-third, so we are doing better, but I know we can do \neven better than that.   \n \nLate to no prenatal care in the U.S. is 6.4 percent; Nevada is at 9.4 percent.  The Healthy \nPeople objective would like to see that under 5 percent.  When compared to other states, we \nrank 48 out of 52—we added Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico.  I know we can do much \nbetter than that. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 10, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nAmong the reasons we would like women to have early prenatal care is getting a due date.  \nIs she pregnant with a single baby or with multiple babies?  We can get a baseline for vitals:  \nwhat is her blood pressure normally, what is her weight because we do not want her to gain \ntoo  much  weight.    If  blood  pressure  starts spiking  during  her  pregnancy,  it  can  be  an \nindication of preeclampsia.  We really do not know why some women develop it, but those \nwho get it just have it during pregnancy and the only cure for it is to deliver the baby.  She \nneeds to be monitored because she can have a stroke.  Those are things we want to check out.   \n \nWe also want to test for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).  Nevada is one of the highest \nstates for congenital syphilis, so we want to make sure we can test and treat women for \nSTDs.  We want to do interventions for women who may be using alcohol, tobacco products, \nor drugs—both prescription and nonprescription.  We want to check for any chronic illnesses \nshe may have.  If she already has diabetes, we definitely want to monitor that, and some \nwomen will develop diabetes during pregnancy.  We want to get her in as early as possible.  \nAt this time, I will turn this over to Dr. Nathan Slotnick. \n \nNathan Slotnick, M.D., Private Citizen, Reno, Nevada: \nI am a high-risk obstetrician and medical geneticist.  I have been in practice for many years, \nand I want to emphasize what Assemblywoman Gorelow stated—the singular thing we can \ndo to identify, treat, and anticipate preterm labor is early prenatal care.  Early prenatal care, \nabsent  prenatal  care,  or  compromised  prenatal  care  is  a  four-lane  highway  to  preterm \ndelivery.  If we are trying to provide the best possible care for the pregnant women of the \nstate of Nevada, early prenatal care is the best approach we can have. \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nThank you, I appreciate your presenting on A.B. 189.  I was going to have Dr. Brian Iriye, \na perinatologist from Las Vegas, speak, but he had to take care of other patients and was \nunavailable.  I do have Kristine Hafner who will tell us her story. \n \nKristine Hafner, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \nOur adoptive daughter was born at approximately 33 weeks gestation with a condition called \ngastroschisis.  This is when some, or in her case, all of her intestines were on the outside of \nher body at the time of birth.  Her lower half was placed in a protective sterile sheet bag \ncalled a \"silo\" to keep her safe from infection for the first 48 hours until the first surgery \ncould take place.  Unfortunately, her intestines began to die off and continued to do so for the \nfirst two years of her life.  As they died off, she had to return to surgery to have them \nremoved.  Skyler now only has half the intestines she should have.  Skyler spent the first 13 \nmonths of her life in the hospital.  She went from the NICU to the pediatric intensive care \nunit to try and discharge her.  She, however, was considered too unstable to go home and was \nsent  to  a  long-term  nursing  facility.    Until  Skyler  was  three-and-a-half  years  old  and \ndischarged to us, she lived between the hospital and the nursing facility.  Though some \nchildren with this condition can tolerate food fed directly into their stomachs with tubes, \nSkyler has not been so fortunate.  She is now dependent on a permanent IV that lives in her \nchest to meet her caloric needs.  Even now with her home, she has her IV nutrition 14 hours \na day, two pumps to infuse that, emergency medications with us at all times and continuous \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 10, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nfeeding tubes 24 hours a day.  This condition can happen naturally, but in Skyler's case it is \nbelieved to be caused by biological mom's drug involvement.  Members of this Committee, \nthis is why A.B. 189 is so important to pass and hopes to prevent or minimize this condition \nand life circumstances like Skyler's.  Skyler's life could have been very different if help was \navailable for bio-mom. \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nDid you mention to the Committee how much her medication is? \n \nKristine Hafner: \nShe is on Medicaid.  We have been given estimates of anywhere from $650 a day to $2,500 \na week.  She is still considered to be rather unstable and it changes weekly, so what the \nmedication costs changes weekly. \n \nKelly Bumgarner, Director of Health Policy, Children's Advocacy Alliance: \nThis is my daughter Miriam, and she is here today because I had complications that sent me \nto the emergency room early in my second trimester.  I was able to visit the high-risk \npregnancy center the next day and begin a course of treatment that kept us both alive and \nhealthy.  I am so grateful for the treatment I received, but I know if it had not been for my \nprivilege, the color of my skin, my health insurance, or even the vehicle I used to get to all \nthose appointments, the outcome might have been vastly different. \n \nAccording  to  the  Georgetown  Center  for  Children  and  Families,  Black  and  American \nIndian/Alaska Native women die from problems in pregnancy two to three times more than \nwhite women.  Only one in three pregnant women living in Laughlin receives early prenatal \ncare.  In Washoe, one in five receives early care, which experts attribute to a disproportionate \nlack of care in its rural areas.  No one experiencing the fear I felt that day should also have to \nworry about whether they can afford to see a doctor, find a doctor, or find a doctor who will \nproperly address their concerns and save their baby's life. \n \nThe Children's Advocacy Alliance is thrilled to stand with Assemblywoman Gorelow and the \nstatewide Strong Start Prenatal-to-Three collaborative in support of presumptive eligibility.  \nThe collaborative is alarmed by our state's maternal mortality and morbidity rates.  We know \nthat access to care increases utilization during early pregnancy.  Centers for Disease Control \nand  Prevention  (CDC)  data  indicate  significant  increases  in  preconception  health \nconversations  with  providers,  folic acid  consumption,  and  postpartum  contraception  use \nwhen women have access to Medicaid.  We have established a multiyear statewide plan to \nincrease Medicaid enrollment and utilization to improve health outcomes for low-income \npregnant  persons  and  babies.    Our  goals  include  presumptive  eligibility,  extending \npostpartum coverage, increasing the percentage of FPL at which pregnancy is Medicaid-\neligible, and ensuring lawfully residing pregnant persons can access Medicaid. \n \nData show these actions increase the likelihood pregnant women will seek early care and \nhave positive pregnancy and birth outcomes.  Pre- and postnatal care are unique instances in \nwhich  expanding  coverages  decreases  not  only  adverse  health  outcomes,  but  also  costs \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 10, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nto Medicaid  and  taxpayers.    In  2007,  the  Institute  of  Medicine  calculated  a  preterm \nbirth typically resulted in a $33,000 bill while a full-term birth cost about $3,000.  That is \na difference of $30,000 per birth.  Thank you for your consideration of these important \nefforts to protect moms and babies. \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nThere are about 50,000 women who live in obstetric deserts in Nevada.  Again, presumptive \neligibility can help a lot of those women who have to travel long distances to get to a doctor.  \nIf we can presume them eligible and they can work on their application at the same time, we \ncan get them the care they need. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any questions?  I also would encourage everyone to look at the interim committee \nwork done on this topic.  Our policy analyst, Patrick Ashton, will send information on this \nbill and the next bill we will be hearing today to Committee members so you can review \nsome of the interim work done in preparation for these bill presentations. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank you for allowing me to be a cosponsor on this bill.  I have been asking questions for \na long time regarding presumptive eligibility and lowering Medicaid costs.  I appreciate the \ntestimony regarding the cost of premature delivery and the cost of taking care of these \nchildren.  When these babies are born they are ours, so we take care of them.  I have been \narguing for a long time for them to be taken care of while they are still intrauterine and we \ncan make them healthier babies when they are born.  Eventually, they will be ours, and \nI would rather they be healthy Nevadans than being born with issues we continue to pay for. \n \nFor the record, I am going to argue this bill as being fiscally responsible because I believe the \nreturn-on-investment argument can be made here.  What does it cost to have these women \nreceive prenatal care?  We heard about the cost of taking care of the babies after they are \nborn if there is a problem, but what will this cost Medicaid?  Did we get a fiscal note on this?  \nWhat is the estimated cost per enrollee?   \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nI got a fiscal note today.  I totaled it up, and it is about $6.8 million.  I would have to figure \nout what that would be per woman.  When I was doing the math, at an average of $76,000, \nthat is 90 babies whom we need to get to full-term and we will break even.  With our preterm \nbirth rate at about 3,800, I think that is doable.  That is reducing our preterm births by \n2 percent.  With the Healthy People objective of having us at around 9.4 percent overall, that \nis more than 90 births.  With 36,000 births, at 9 percent we would be looking at about 3,500.  \nIf we got those 90 births, we would be on our way toward that goal.  If we meet our goal, we \nwill surpass those 90 babies, and this is definitely cost effective. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThat is the point I wanted to make on the record:  It does not take many babies or many \nwomen to lower the overall costs.  With a fiscal note of that size, I think we need to keep it in \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 10, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nperspective.  The first response is going to be that it is too expensive, but I would say—not \nonly  emotionally  but  also  physically  for  those  who  testified  about  the  health  of  their \nchildren—that we cannot put a cost on that.  However, in real dollars for the state, I think we \nneed to document that. \n \nThe second thing to note is that we will only do this as allowed by the federal government.  \nWe will not be doing this at the risk of losing our Medicaid dollars, so we have to make sure \nwe are in conjunction with federal government regulations.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there more questions? \n \nAssemblywoman Black: \nWhat qualified provider will decide if a patient is eligible?  How does that process look?  \nWhen a mom comes in and is visiting with her provider, is her provider going to ask those \nqualifying questions? \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nYes, the provider will have to ask qualifying questions to make sure the woman would \nqualify for Medicaid.  Not anybody can just say, Oh, I am going to be presumed eligible and \nget the care.  If they do not meet the federal guidelines, then they cannot be presumed \neligible.  So there will be questions for the provider to ask the pregnant mom so we can make \nsure she would qualify as her application is being processed.  In other states, the provider has \nto have a high acceptance rate for Medicaid—90 or 95 percent—and they are not just \naccepting anyone or presuming anyone eligible. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe have DuAne Young from Medicaid here who might be able to answer your question with \nmore specificity. \n \nDuAne Young, Deputy Administrator, Division of Health Care Financing and Policy, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services: \nThese women would receive outpatient ambulatory services.  In the period in which they \nwere eligible, they would have 60 days to submit their full Medicaid application.  Once being \nmade fully Medicaid eligible, we would go back 90 days and cover all those other services \nthat are outside the ambulatory outpatient services related to the pregnancy. \n \nLisa Swearingen, Chief, Eligibility and Payments, Division of Welfare and Supportive \nServices, Department of Health and Human Services: \nWe currently have a presumptive eligibility program in the hospitals.   That is a process we \nhave in place where they apply, they are certified, they are trained, and they have to meet \ncertain criteria.  We would do that with this other group.  They would have to go through \ntraining, be certified, and then we have a quality control group that monitors to make sure \nthey are meeting all the federal requirements.  These individuals are eligible for two months, \nbut it is actually the last day of the month following the month of enrollment.  It could be \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 10, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \n30 days because if someone applied on the 30th of a month, that person would only get to the \nend of the following month, so it is important that the providers work with these individuals \nto make sure they submit their Medicaid applications so we can get them enrolled sooner and \nmake sure there is not a break in service. \n \nAssemblywoman Black: \nThat may be where I am misunderstanding the sentence in section 1, subsection 1 where it \nstates \". . . the last day of the month immediately following the month of enrollment without \nsubmitting an application for enrollment in Medicaid which includes additional proof of \neligibility.\"  Is that where you are getting the 60 days and the 90 days?  That sentence just \nconfuses me because how can you enroll for a month without submitting an application? \n \nLisa Swearingen: \nPresumptive eligibility is for what we call \"two months.\"  If a person were to apply the first \nof March, that person would be eligible through presumptive eligibility through March and \nthe end of April.  Within the time period, the person has to submit a full Medicaid application \nand the verifications to be determined eligible for Medicaid.  If the person applied at the end \nof March, it says it is the last day of the month following enrollment so that means the person \nwould only get from March 31 through the end of April.  That is a shortened window, but we \nare stressing that they get their applications submitted as soon as possible so we can get them \nfull Medicaid.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any other follow-up questions?  [There were none.]  At this time, we will take \ncallers in support.  Please remember to clearly state and spell your name.  Testimony is \nlimited  to  two  minutes,  and  I  would  encourage  you  to  provide  any  additional  written \ntestimony within 48 hours of the close of this hearing on A.B. 189. \n \nKatie Ryan, System Director, Nevada Government Relations, Dignity Health-St. Rose \nDominican: \nWe want to go on the record today as being in support of A.B. 189.  I, too, had access to \ngreat prenatal care, including many of the high-risk pregnancy centers, and without that \naccess, things could have been very different for my now three-and-a-half-year-old son Jack.  \nLet us give that access to everyone. \n \nKatie Robbins, representing Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada: \nWe are here to voice our support for A.B. 189.  Presumptive eligibility serves the important \nrole of providing immediate access to much-needed health care for pregnant women, while \nalso putting them on a path to continued coverage.  The importance of quality prenatal and \npostpartum care is well known.  We are in support of making it easier for pregnant women to \naccess these services.  We strongly support A.B. 189 and urge the Committee to, as well. \n \nConnor Cain, representing HCA Healthcare, and Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center: \nI am testifying today in support of A.B. 189.  I would like to first thank all the sponsors of \nthis legislation, especially Assemblywoman Gorelow for all the work on this issue.  I know \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 10, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nhow important it is to her.  I would be remiss if I did not thank Director Bierman and \nDirector Whitley for always having an open door, especially as it relates to Medicaid.  I also \nwant to recognize Skyler's bravery and toughness.  I am sure she is an inspiration to everyone \nlistening or watching today. \n \nAs many of you are aware, Sunrise Hospital is the largest provider of Medicaid services in \nthe state.  It is something we are extremely proud of, but given that our state ranks forty-ninth \nin Medicaid expenditure per capita, it is also challenging.  Roughly 4,500 babies are born \nevery year at Sunrise Hospital, and about 80 percent of them are covered by Medicaid.  The \nmost vulnerable of these babies end up at the hospital's 72-bed NICU, which is the largest \nand most comprehensive in the region.  It has nearly 1,000 patients annually and, by itself, \nresults in significant losses every year due to low reimbursement rates.  One of the most \nsignificant problems the hospital sees every day is the lack of prenatal care that many moms \nreceive.  We support A.B. 189 because we believe it can help lead to better outcomes for \nmoms and babies.  We also encourage you to continue to support [unintelligible] Medicaid \nfunding.   \n \nTess Opferman, representing Nevada Women's Lobby: \nWe want to thank Assemblywoman Gorelow for bringing this legislation forward which will \nallow pregnant women access to critical care during pregnancy, through the birth process, \nand through recovery.  Nevada is in the top 12 states when it comes to the percentage of \nwomen who are uninsured during pregnancy.  Please help ensure mothers and babies are \nhealthy by giving access to necessary insurance through pregnancy by passing this key \nlegislation. \n \nLea Case, representing Nevada Psychiatric Association: \nThe Nevada Psychiatric Association would like to express our support for A.B. 189 as \namended, expanding postpartum Medicaid coverage from 60 days to 12 months following \nchildbirth.  According to the CDC's ERASEMM [Enhancing Reviews and Surveillance to \nEliminate Maternal Mortality] update for the Western District, mental health conditions are \nthe leading cause of preventable pregnancy-related deaths.  I have submitted this information \nto the Committee secretary.  These deaths, including suicides and overdoses, are more likely \nto occur between 43 days and one year after giving birth.  Extending postpartum Medicaid \ncoverage for a full year will give mothers continuity of care and access to appropriate \ntreatment for any number of postpartum health issues, including postpartum depression and \npostpartum psychosis.  Babies continue on Medicaid for one year after birth; continuing this \ncoverage for the mother as well will ensure these babies have a healthy parent too. \n \nMelissa Clement, representing Nevada Right to Life: \nNevada Right to Life wholeheartedly supports A.B. 189, and we thank the sponsor and all \nwho worked on this very important legislation.  \n \nSequila Angkratok, representing Human Services Network: \nWe are calling to voice our support of amended A.B. 189 on behalf of our many human \nservices member organizations.  As a new mother of two months, I cannot imagine having to \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 10, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nworry  about  health  coverage  during  my  pregnancy.    Even  with  medical  coverage,  the \nphysical and emotional stress of pregnancy can create a hostile environment for the infant \nand medical complications for the expectant mother.  Lack of adequate and easily accessible \nmedical coverage is an immense stressor no mother should have to endure. \n \nI would like to highlight today that pregnant women in Nevada suffering low-income status, \noften persons of underserved Black and Brown communities, are already a tremendously \nvulnerable population.  According to the CDC, Black mothers are two to three, to as much as \nfive times more likely, dependent on age, to die in childbirth than a white woman.  The Black \ninfant mortality rate is well above double that of white infants.  These women are already \nliving under tremendous weight of significant disparities within our society, suffering from \nstruggles with nutrition, income, trauma, et cetera.  These women should never have to \nwonder how they will be able to survive childbirth or bear healthy babies.  They deserve the \nbasic  human  right  of  access  to  quality  medical  coverage  both  during  pregnancy  and \npostpartum.    \n \nLashonda Marve-Austin, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \nI am here today in support of A.B. 189 as it is amended.  I went through postpartum \ndepression with my daughter.  I was not able to properly care for or nurse her.  Having to put \nher on formula was something I did not want to do.  Had I had the opportunity to have \nextended coverage through Medicaid, I think I probably would have been able to get support \nin order to care for my daughter the way I would have liked.  I want to thank everyone who \nworked on the bill. \n \nQuentin Savwoir, Deputy Director, Make It Work Nevada: \nWe work alongside Black women and Black families in the areas of economic justice, racial \njustice, and reproductive justice.  We are thrilled that Assemblywoman Gorelow has brought \nthis bill to the Committee and that you are hearing this measure, as we have long worked to \nbuild power to bring greater awareness to issues around maternal mortality in our country.  \nThe United States has become the most dangerous place in the developed world for a person \nto give birth.  Assembly Bill 189 is a racial and reproductive justice issue that is the first step \nto shake the scourge of this unsettling statistic.  By now I know you have all heard the \nresearch and data about how disparate the realities are for Black women, Brown women, and \nother melanated parents during childbirth.  Their access to resources is limited.  They are \nreporting subpar treatment by medical professionals, and, in some cases, they are dying.   \n \nThe problem is so pervasive that we can safely assume this is happening in numerous \ncommunities throughout our country.  The reality is sad in and of itself, but I cannot help but \nthink about the children.  I cannot help but think about how their lives would be more \nenhanced  and  enriched  if  we  were  proactive  in  providing  mothers  and  parents  with \npostpartum  medical  visits,  supports,  and  additional  care  that  is  currently  unavailable \nto Medicaid enrollees in our state.  Current Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) provides for \n60 days of postpartum Medicaid coverage; however, this is not reflective of the needs of the \nmothers and birth parents that we organize and work alongside.  Our community members \nfrequently reference challenges related to fatigue, breastfeeding, and added stress when a \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 10, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nnew baby comes home.  This measure will expand the safety net for our community members \nwho need a little extra support.  At its core, A.B. 189 is about our children and how we \nintend to raise our children in this state.  It meets the moment we find ourselves in as we try \nto bring greater equity to communities that have been historically overlooked or lacked \naccess to care because of restrictive public policy.  You all can help us continue making \nstrides in the right direction by supporting A.B. 189.  Make It Work Nevada supports this \nmeasure and urges bipartisan support. \n \nSarah Walton, Private Citizen, Reno, Nevada: \nI am voicing support for A.B. 189.  I am a birth and postpartum doula, a childbirth educator, \nand a midwife assistant.  I am the owner of Bright Heart Birth Services, which is a small \nbirth support and education agency, and a co-owner of Biggest Little Baby, which is a baby \nstore and family resource center.  I am the current sitting director at the nonprofit Reno \nDoula Project and the Truckee Meadows Birth Network.  I have always been incredibly \ninvested in my community.  I am Nevada born, a single parent to a now-six-year-old.  He \nwas born while I was covered under Medicaid.  I was lucky enough to have him in Portland \nwhere I had far more access to support and resources as a low-income pregnant person.  I am \nnow back in the Reno area.  I moved back when I was six months postpartum and I did not \nhave the same access when I got back here.  I had the intention of creating and building more \nbridges for community support in the childbearing years in our area because I knew it was \nneeded.   \n \nI have interacted with thousands of people in the community through my organizations and \nleadership through mentoring, free support groups, and sliding-scale doula support.  A large \npercentage  of  the  people  I  am  supporting  are  either  supporting  Medicaid  recipients  or \nMedicaid recipients themselves.  We are often supporting these folks before and after they \nare seen by medical professionals, so we are sometimes expected to shoulder the burden of \nthings within the medical scope and not the role of doulas.  Expanding Medicaid would really \nbe great to include either earlier and later, and both.  It would improve outcomes for the \nparents and the babies and the entire families and get them off to better starts and more \nsecure beginnings as Nevadans. \n \nBreana Lipscomb, representing Center for Reproductive Rights, New York, N.Y.: \nI am the senior manager of the U.S. Maternal Health and Rights Initiative for the Center for \nReproductive Rights.  I am here to express support for the amended A.B. 189.  I would like \nto  focus  on  two  provisions:    presumptive  eligibility  and  the  extension  of  postpartum \nMedicaid coverage to 12 months. \n \nPresumptive eligibility makes access to prenatal care simpler and less burdensome.  One \nstudy found that presumptive eligibility policies increase the likelihood that pregnant women \nwill obtain prenatal care in the first trimester by 30 percent.  Inadequate prenatal care has \nbeen  linked  to  preterm  labor  and  low  birth  weight  and  many  other  adverse  effects  as \nindicated by Assemblywoman Gorelow.  By removing a barrier to earlier prenatal care, \npresumptive eligibility encourages access to treatment and services that help improve the \nhealth of both moms and babies and may reduce future medical costs.  The majority of states \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 10, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nare already implementing presumptive Medicaid eligibility for pregnant women, and this \nincludes many states in our geographic region. \n \nRegarding extending Medicaid coverage to 12 months after delivery, this is critical to making \nsure that birthing people have access to the critical health care services they need.  We know \nthat the majority of maternal deaths are preventable, and data show that 60 percent of the \nbirths in this state are covered by Medicaid, yet women are losing coverage only 60 days \nafter delivery.  Ensuring the full 12 months of postpartum coverage is an opportunity to have \na major impact on the majority of pregnant and postpartum people in this state, so I urge you \nto pass A.B. 189 out of Committee.  It creates an opportunity for women to achieve their \noptimal standard of maternal health and is one step closer to closing the maternal health \nracial disparity gap in Nevada. \n \nAshley Dodson, representing Make It Work Nevada: \nI am a social worker and representative of Make It Work Nevada in support of A.B. 189 as it \nis amended.  As a Black mother of five and previous recipient of Medicaid, I know the \ndisparity firsthand of not having insurance coverage after the birth of a child.  My maternal \nhealth was at risk for several factors including the trauma of being considered a high-risk \npregnancy.  Often after birth, due to my circumstances, it was a struggle to properly care \nafter my children as the birth was daunting and traumatic.  Not having access to continued \ncare postpartum also prohibited me from giving my children the proper care they needed in \ntheir first weeks after birth and the necessary well-checks as well as my own health.  I also \nran into issues with securing quality affordable child care while working or reentering the \nwork force.  All these obstacles caused me to be under increased levels of stress and pressure \nwhich led to postpartum depression and anxiety.  I then had to receive therapeutic services \nwhich I could not have covered due to lack of insurance and ability to pay cash due to lack of \nincome.  This caused me much headache and heartache because I did not have access to the \nresources I needed for myself or my children.  My experiences did not go as planned because \nof the lack of insurance and proper care.   \n \nWith  Medicaid  being  expanded  into  a  woman's  fourth  trimester,  it  will  decrease  other \ninjustices Black women face such as pay inequity, affordable housing, and quality affordable \nchild care.  Racism, classism, and sexism have been tied directly to the health and wellness \nof Black mothers in this country.  Black women are three to four times more likely to have \npregnancy-related  deaths  than  their  white  women  counterparts.    These  numbers  are \nstaggering and traumatic.  Imagine being a woman who, throughout your entire pregnancy \nand birth experience, is constantly thinking and knowing the high possibility you may not get \nto see your child.  No woman should experience this as a result of lack of care and insurance.  \nThis narrative has to change.  Again, I urge the Committee to support and pass A.B. 189 as \namended. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 10, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIs there anyone else in support?  [There was no one.]  Are there any callers in opposition to \nA.B. 189?  [There were none.]  We will move to testimony in neutral. \n \nLisa Swearingen: \nWe want to thank Assemblywoman Gorelow and the Interim Legislative Committee on \nHealth Care for bringing this bill forward.  The Division of Welfare and Supportive Services \nwould like to request amending the effective date of the bill to possibly July 2022, which \nwould allow our agency time to develop and implement these changes.  We do have a fiscal \nnote attached to the bill for these system enhancements, but we look forward to working with \nAssemblywoman Gorelow and addressing any questions or comments that come up. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo you have any closing remarks, Assemblywoman Gorelow? \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nAs we have heard in the testimony, expanding Medicaid to pregnant women in Nevada \nis good for moms, it is good for babies, and it will help reduce the costs of preterm birth, \nnot only in immediate NICU costs, but long-term costs as well.  I would like to thank \nDr. Slotnick for filling in at the last second to give us more information on prenatal care.  \nI would also like to thank Kristine Hafner, Kelly Bumgarner, and everyone who called in \ntoday in support. \n \n[Exhibit D and Exhibit E were submitted but not discussed and will become part of the \nrecord.] \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 189 and open the hearing on Assembly Bill 192.  Our Policy \nAnalyst, Patrick Ashton, will send everyone a link so you may see some of the interim work \nthat was done in consideration of this bill.  This is another bill that came out of the work done \nby the Interim Legislative Committee on Health Care.  Assemblywoman Cohen was on that \ncommittee and will present the bill. \n \nAssembly Bill 192:  Revises provisions governing the testing of pregnant women for \ncertain sexually transmitted infections. (BDR 40-453) \n \nAssemblywoman Lesley E. Cohen, Assembly District No. 29: \nI am here today to present Assembly Bill 192 for your consideration.  It is really important \nfor the health of pregnant women and their babies.  During the 2019-2020 Interim, I chaired \nthe Legislative Committee on Health Care.  Two of our priorities were public health and \nmaternal and child health.  This bill addresses both.  I would like to note that there is \na conceptual amendment that should be on the Nevada Electronic Legislative Information \nSystem [Exhibit F].   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 10, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sexually transmitted \ndiseases (STDs) can cause pregnancy complications and result in serious consequences for \nboth mothers and developing babies.  In 2019, the CDC identified newborn deaths from \nsyphilis as \"the most alarming threat\" and emphasized the need to test all pregnant women \nfor syphilis in line with CDC recommendations. \n \nThis is especially important in Nevada because in 2018, we had the highest rate of primary \nand secondary syphilis in the nation.  The problem is especially acute in the Las Vegas-\nHenderson-Paradise region, which had the highest rates of primary and secondary syphilis of \nall metropolitan areas that report to the CDC.  We also had the second-highest rate of \ncongenital syphilis, which is when a mother with syphilis passes the infection on to her baby \nduring pregnancy, and trends have not been moving in the right direction.  According to the \nCDC, Nevada saw a 289 percent increase in congenital syphilis between 2015 and 2018. \n \nCongenital  syphilis  can  significantly  affect  a  baby's  health.    It  can  cause  miscarriage, \nstillbirth, prematurity, low birth weight, or even death.  Up to 40 percent of babies born to \nwomen with untreated syphilis may be stillborn or die from the infection as a newborn.  \nCongenital syphilis can also result in deformed bones, enlarged liver and spleen, brain and \nnerve problems, and a host of other health issues. \n \nThe good news is that both syphilis and congenital syphilis are preventable.  Syphilis can be \ntreated and cured with antibiotics, and congenital syphilis can be treated, though babies who \nhave it need to be treated as soon as possible to reduce the risk of serious health conditions.  \nHowever, the key to treatment and prevention is ensuring moms are tested for syphilis and \nreceive prenatal care. \n \nThe bill aims to align Nevada's STD testing requirements with CDC recommendations.  \nSection 1 requires physicians and other providers who are permitted by law to attend to \npregnant women to ensure they are tested for chlamydia trachomatis, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, \nand hepatitis C, as recommended by the CDC.  The physician or other person must ensure \nthat samples are taken from the woman and submitted to a laboratory.  However, subsection \n3 provides that pregnant women may opt out of required testing. \n \nSection 2 of the bill revises existing requirements related to syphilis testing for pregnant \nwomen.  It revises who must conduct syphilis testing or ensure it is done, and when.  The \nstate has found an association between lack of prenatal care and congenital syphilis, and the \ngoal of the bill is to reach pregnant women where they seek health care, regardless of \nwhether they seek pregnancy-related services.  For this reason, section 2, subsection 1, \nparagraph (c) requires hospital emergency departments and certain other medical facilities to \ntest pregnant women for syphilis if they indicate they have not had recommended prenatal \nscreenings and tests. \n \nSection 2, subsection 2, paragraph (c) clarifies when syphilis testing must be done, including \nat delivery for pregnant women who: \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 10, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \n•  Should be routinely tested for syphilis, as recommended by the CDC. \n•  Live in areas designated by the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services as having high syphilis rates. \n•  Did not receive prenatal care. \n•  Deliver a stillborn infant after 20 weeks of gestation.    \n \nSection 3 revises existing criminal penalties for failing to do required syphilis testing and \ninstead assesses a civil penalty of not more than $500. \n \nWhen the Legislative Committee on Health Care held its work session in September last \nyear, we had not quite worked out all the details for this bill.  However, over the past week, \nI met with the Nevada Hospital Association and the Division of Public and Behavioral Health \nto iron out a few amendments which should help achieve our goals in a way that the hospital \nemergency departments can implement. \n \nI will go through the amendment with you.  We replaced a reference to \"laboratory approved \nby State Board of Health\" in sections 1 and 2 of the bill with \"a laboratory licensed pursuant \nto Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 652.\"  Next, we deleted section 1, subsection 2, \nsuch that testing required by the section and done by the State Health Laboratory is not \nrequired to be done without charge.  We clarified that hospital and emergency departments \nand medical facilities must ask women of childbearing age whether they are pregnant.  That \nwas defined by the CDC's definition of childbearing age.  If the results of the blood test \nrequired in section 2 show that the pregnant woman is infected with syphilis, and if the result \nis received while the woman is in the emergency department or medical facility, they must \ncommence  treatment  for  syphilis.    When  they  notify  the  local  health  authority  of  the \nconfirmed case of syphilis as is required by existing law, they are also required to indicate \nthe case involves a pregnant woman. \n \nThe next amendment revises subsection 5 of NRS 442.010.  It provides that if a pregnant \nwoman objects to the taking of a sample of blood or the serological test for any reason, the \nsample must not be taken and the test must not be performed.  Existing law currently allows \nan objection only on a religious basis.  Next, this requires health insurers and providers \nregulated by the state of Nevada to pay for the testing mandated by sections 1 and 2 of this \nbill.  Our next change revises the list of medical facilities to which the requirements of the \nbill apply.  We did not change \"medical facility\" in the NRS; we cut down which medical \nfacilities need to comply with this.  That list is on the amendment. \n \nFinally, we clarified that section 2, subsection 1, paragraph (c) relates to \"an emergency \ndepartment in a hospital that evaluates or provides treatment to pregnant women.\"  This \nintent is to have hospitals test pregnant women who are evaluated or treated in the emergency \ndepartment,  not  just  those  who  are  admitted  as  inpatients.    Sometimes  you  can  be  in \na hospital for quite a long time, even days, and technically not be admitted to the hospital but \nstill be in the emergency room having treatment. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 10, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nMelissa Peek-Bullock, State Epidemiologist, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services: \nWe are available for any questions. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDoes this match the CDC guidelines or are we requesting that all women be tested in the first \nand third trimester, or is it just the women who match these risk factors? \n \nAssemblywoman Cohen: \nWe already have first and third trimester in our statutes. \n \nElizabeth Kessler, Program Manager, Sexually Transmitted Diseases, Division of Public \nand Behavior Health, Department of Health and Human Services: \nThis bill aligns with CDC guidance and we worded it in a way that for endemic areas, we can \nexpand that testing when necessary.  With our state being number one in our primary and \nsecondary syphilis rates, and our congenital syphilis rates being second in the nation, we are \nidentified by the CDC as one of the hot spots that should not just be looking at risk factors \nand should be screening all pregnant women. \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nAre we testing for HPV [human papilloma virus] and is it included in this bill?   That seems \nto be an STD that a lot of women have who do not know it.  I know it can cause some \nproblems with babies.  \n \nElizabeth Kessler: \nOur office can check on that, but it was not included in this recommendation. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nJust  to  be  clear,  there  is  already  existing  language  that  requires  testing  during  various \ntrimesters for syphilis.  It is extremely troubling that Nevada ranks number one in congenital \nsyphilis.  We are looking for solutions for this, and testing is one.  It may not decrease the \nnumber of cases of syphilis, but if we can fix the number of cases of congenital syphilis, it is \nwise to do so.  I have questions regarding the bill specifically.  I have a question regarding \nthe terminology in section 1 on line 1, \"Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, \na physician or other person permitted by law . . . .\"  Who are those \"other persons\" currently \nin Nevada \"permitted by law\" to attend a delivery?   \n \nElizabeth Kessler: \nThose \"other persons\" would encompass people like APRNs [advance practice registered \nnurses], midwives, and other health care personnel who may not necessarily be medical \ndoctors or physicians. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nWhy  use  the  terminology  \"other  persons  permitted  by  law\"  as  opposed  to  leaving  out \nphysicians and just saying, \"a health care provider\"?  That is what we have been going to.  \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 10, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nOver the last several sessions, I have had bills trying to clean up the language regarding \nproviders of health care.  We have been using the term \"health care provider.\"  Is there any \nplace in our statutes that uses that terminology—a person, a physician, or other persons \npermitted by law? \n \nAssemblywoman Cohen: \nWe were trying to clarify.  Certainly, there are other health care providers who attend upon \npregnant women.  We wanted to be sure we captured everyone; however, I can work with the \nLegal Division to be sure we have the phrasing right to encompass what we are trying to \ncover.  When we first got the bill, we did discuss who it meant—who is covered.  It does not \nmean a doula.  We can continue to talk about that and make sure it is as concise as possible. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nGood, because we continue to fix these bills after they go through.  We have worked on the \ndefinition of \"provider\" for several sessions now, and it includes physician assistant and \nnurse midwife.  The terminology was different, and I wanted clarification. \n \nWhen we have heard these bills before, we are always concerned about the costs of doing \nthese tests and who will be responsible for paying for these tests.  Has Medicaid said that \nthey will cover these tests if they are drawn in the emergency rooms?   \n \nAssemblywoman Cohen: \nThe hospital association had concerns about the costs and what the hospitals would be \nresponsible for.  It is my understanding that it will be covered by Medicaid, so the hospitals \nwill be reimbursed, and obviously, they would also be reimbursed by regular insurance.  That \nwas something we addressed in the amendment to make sure that we were not leaving \nhospitals financially in the lurch with this.   \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI have not seen the amendment.  This question is in regard to section 3 and the changing of \nthe wording for consequences if a provider does not obtain these tests.  It is already in statute \nthat we as providers are mandated to do certain testing.  It is already in statute that during this \nperiod of time there would be a consequence.   You are taking that wording out and adding \n\"a physician  or  other  person\"  attending  a  woman  who  fails  to  perform  this,  including \na hospital or medical facility.  You are removing that as a misdemeanor but now putting in \nfines.  How did you arrive at that?  I am concerned about section 3, subsection 3, the \nenforcement through our Attorney General or district attorneys.  I am concerned about the \nliability for the providers.  I know we want to have a stick; I know we want to make sure they \ndo this, but fines to the providers is a big pushback for me.  Where did the $500 fine come \nfrom?  Is that a standard penalty?  Is that written somewhere else that if we, as providers, do \nnot do our jobs there are other penalties, or is this unique to this bill? \n \nAssemblywoman Cohen: \nThe most important part is that we took out the misdemeanor, which is in existing law.  As \nyou said, we need some way to enforce it.  Five hundred dollars is an amount that is used \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 10, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nquite often in the NRS for civil penalties.  We want to make sure we have an enforcement \nmechanism. \n \nErin Lynch, Chief, Medical Programs Unit, Division of Health Care Financing and \nPolicy, Department of Health and Human Services: \nAssemblywoman  Cohen  answered  the  question  about  whether  Medicaid  covers  syphilis \ntesting, and we do.  We already cover it in the emergency room setting, in the clinic setting, \nand even in the inpatient delivery setting.  That would already be included in the per diem \nrate for the hospital stay.  Overall, Medicaid does cover syphilis. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nYou said it is covered in the Medicaid per diem rate.  If you pay a flat rate to see a pregnant \nwoman, they are not being reimbursed for the syphilis test. \n \nErin Lynch: \nRight.  For all inpatient services, whether very few services are performed or a lot of services \nare being performed, no matter what, a hospital is reimbursed a daily per diem rate. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nSo in actuality, whether that test is performed or not, they are going to get a flat rate.  If they \ndo that test, because they have to pay for that test, it may indeed cost them some money, \ncorrect? \n \nErin Lynch: \nWe are speaking about the inpatient side. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nCorrect. \n \nErin Lynch: \nFor the emergency room side, it would get reimbursed separately for that. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nBut not for the in-house. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any other questions at this time from Committee members?  [There were none.]  \nI will go now to testimony in support, opposition, and neutral on A.B. 192.  [The Chair \nreminded  callers  of  the  protocol  and  procedures  for  virtual  meetings.]    We  will  go  to \ntestimony in support of A.B. 192. \n \nTess Opferman, representing Nevada Women's Lobby: \nOne of the main goals of the Nevada Women's Lobby is to promote the health and well-being \nof women and families.  It is a top priority of ours to help promote access to affordable health \ncare.  We are in full support of this legislation which will help give access to testing for \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 10, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nsyphilis, benefiting both mom and baby.  Thank you to Assemblywoman Cohen for bringing \nforward this legislation, and thank you to the Committee for your time. \n \nBradley Mayer, representing Southern Nevada Health District: \nI am testifying in support.  Nevada has been number one or number two in syphilis and \ncongenital syphilis in recent years.  Since 2014, cases have increased 1,333 percent.  The \nproblem  is  particularly  acute  among  women  who  do  not  have  prenatal  care,  so  any \nopportunity we can get to find cases adds to the current efforts public health is taking to \nmitigate the spread of this disease.  Earlier intervention is necessary to prevent babies being \nborn with syphilis, so we urge your support. \n \nBill Welch, President/CEO, Nevada Hospital Association: \nI would like to thank Assemblywoman Cohen for reaching out to the Nevada Hospital \nAssociation to inquire about our perspective on A.B. 192.  I am speaking today in support of \nthe amendment being presented by her on A.B. 192, and we look forward to working with \nher and others on the passage of A.B. 192.  We think this is a good piece of legislation. \n \nJoelle Gutman-Dodson, Government Affairs Liaison, Washoe County Health District: \nWe are here today in support of A.B. 192.  We would like to thank the bill's sponsor, \nAssemblywoman Cohen, for bringing this bill forward.  The Washoe County Health District \nsupports  expanding  testing  for  sexually  transmitted  infections  for  pregnant  women  as \noutlined  in  this  bill.    As  previously  stated,  Nevada  ranks  number  two  in  the  U.S.  for \ncongenital syphilis cases and in the top 15 states for chlamydia and gonorrhea, indicating the \nneed for more screening to identify infections.  We urge your support of this bill. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nCan we go to our next caller in support?  [There was no one.]  Is there any testimony in \nopposition to A.B. 192?  [There was none.]  I know we have several people registered to \ntestify in neutral. \n \nErin Lynch: \nAt the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy, otherwise known as Nevada Medicaid, \nwe already cover STD testing, which includes syphilis, for pregnant women.  We cover it in \nthe  emergency  department  setting,  in the  hospital  setting,  or in the  clinic  setting.    We \nestimate that we would have a zero-dollar fiscal impact on this.  The reason behind it is that \nwe believe that the benefits of testing pregnant women for syphilis and preventing negative \nhealth outcomes to mom and baby far outweigh the costs of testing.  We are neutral on this \nbill. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIs there anyone else who would like to present testimony in neutral?  [There was no one.]  \nI will turn this back over to Assemblywoman Cohen for any closing remarks. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 10, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nAssemblywoman Cohen: \nThe Legislative Committee on Health Care chose to pursue this policy change because of its \npotential to improve the health of mothers and babies in Nevada and because congenital \nsyphilis is preventable and both syphilis and congenital syphilis are treatable.  We need to do \nbetter.  By aligning STD testing with CDC guidelines and expanding testing requirements to \nhospital emergency departments and other medical facilities, we hope to be able to reach \na broader population of pregnant women and reverse these unfortunate trends.  I am open for \nmore questions after the hearing if anyone has any.  To Assemblywoman Titus's question \nabout who is a provider, I believe we got that language out of NRS 442.008.  I will talk to the \nLegal Division and get more clarification.    \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 192 and open the hearing on Assembly Bill 198.  \n   \nAssembly Bill 198:  Requires Medicaid to cover certain genetic testing. (BDR 38-13) \n \nAssemblywoman Lisa Krasner, Assembly District No. 26: \nBefore I begin, I would like to note that I submitted a conceptual amendment which should \nbe available on the Nevada Electronic Legislative Information System (NELIS) [Exhibit G].   \n \nPrenatal screenings are routine procedures during pregnancy that detect whether a fetus likely \nhas  certain  health  conditions  or  chromosomal  abnormalities.    Screening  tests  are  not \ndiagnostic;  they  only  provide  a  probability  that  a  particular  condition  exists.    Nevada \nMedicaid is the single largest payor of births in our state.  In recent years, it covered \napproximately 60 percent of all births statewide.  Currently, Medicaid provides coverage for \nprenatal screenings, including blood panels, ultrasound exam, amniocentesis, and chorionic \nvillus sampling.   \n \nAssembly Bill 198 requires the director of the Department of Health and Human Services to \ninclude in the State Plan for Medicaid coverage for noninvasive prenatal screening to detect \nbirth defects in the fetus of a pregnant woman who is 40 years of age or older, if requested.  \nThe intent of this bill is to add noninvasive prenatal screening to the list of screenings that are \nalready available and women can receive on Nevada Medicaid.  This is also called Cell-Free \nDNA screening and is considered noninvasive because it screens for certain chromosomal \nabnormalities in a simple blood-drawn sample from a pregnant woman, in contrast with some \nother invasive methods such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling.  It carries no risk \nof miscarriage.  Noninvasive prenatal screening can be conducted as early as during the first \ntrimester.   \n \nThe conceptual amendment on NELIS clarifies that the requirements of the bill only relate to \nnoninvasive prenatal screening.  It also clarifies that nothing in this bill shall be construed to \ngrant, secure, or deny any right related to abortion or the funding thereof.  I will now turn my \ntime over to Dr. Nathan Slotnick.  He will discuss the scientific and clinical importance of \nnoninvasive prenatal screening and its utility in pregnancy. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 10, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nNathan Slotnick, M.D., Private Citizen, Reno, Nevada: \n[Nathan Slotnick presented a PowerPoint Exhibit H.]  I would like to thank Assemblywoman \nKrasner for her foresight and energy which have allowed us to address what I consider \na singularly important component of health care for pregnant families and pregnant women, \none that is frequently overlooked by underwriters and by Medicaid in the state of Nevada.  \nI fully understand budgetary restrictions and COVID-19 issues having to do with the state \ncoffers, so I will not address the issues of cost. \n \nI am a perinatal geneticist in private practice in the state of Nevada since 2003 providing \nhealth care, perinatal services, and genetics to the population of the state.  The goal of our \ndiscussion today will be to address a particular area in technology that has relatively recently \ncome to fruition and has tremendous importance in terms of our health care.  I have had \na longstanding career in academics, research, and teaching.  I have been involved in between \n70,000  and  100,000  Nevada  pregnancies  providing  care—ultrasound  prenatal  diagnosis.  \nI have  also  provided  medical  genetics  and  genomic  services  through  Renown  and  am \ncurrently medical director and clinical lead for reproductive health for Invitae Genomics \nCorporation [page 2]. \n \nMy  career  is  congruent  with  the  development  of  screening  for  [unintelligible]  and \nchromosomal abnormalities in pregnancy.  My first publication was in this area many years \nago and the issues having to do with this particular noninvasive testing protocol are ones I am \nintimately  familiar  with  and  have  done  much  research  on.    \"Screening  means  the \nidentification among apparently healthy individuals of those who are sufficiently at risk of \na specific disorder to justify a subsequent diagnostic test or procedure\" [page 3].  This \ndefinition applies to medicine quite well, but screening is part of human nature.  Every time \nwe walk into a room and are faced with meeting new people, we are in a mode of screening \nwhen we evaluate them.  Identifying a patient, identifying a person, evaluating that person, \njudging that person is part of what we do as human beings.  In medicine, the issues of \nscreening  become  even  more  profound  and  meaningful.    In  pregnancy,  screening  is \na component of the initial and continuing evaluation.  When I ask a patient her age when she \nis pregnant, I know that is a screening tool allowing me to get more information about what \nher potential risks for chromosomal abnormalities are.  We have known for years that as \na woman gets older, the risk of a chromosomal abnormality in pregnancy goes up.  When \nI ask a woman her ethnic background, I know that is important as well as being a screening \ntool.  We know that certain ethnic groups have certain genetic conditions more frequently \nfound.  When I ask a woman her religious background, I know there are genetic issues \nimplicit in that question as well.  I am Jewish.  I know that as a Jew, my risk of having \na child with Tay-Sachs disease is much elevated.  All of these are components of screening \nand part and parcel of how we provide care to our pregnant women and pregnant families. \n \nWe are now on the fourth slide [page 4] labeled \"Screening Tests vs. Diagnostic Tests.\"  Let \nus discuss what a diagnostic test is.  A diagnostic test is a high-sensitivity test with a very \nlow rate of false positives and a very low rate of false negatives.  A diagnostic test implies \na diagnosis will be obtained.  By definition, there is very little overlap between the affected \nand unaffected populations. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 10, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \nThe next slide [page 5] tells what a screening is defined to be within the context of medical \ntesting and what the applications are.  Screening tests have a much different application in \npopulations.  There is a much broader population application for screening tests, and by \ndefinition, the sensitivity and specificity of screening tests are arbitrarily defined.  The \narbitrariness of screening tests relates to the definition either by a community or another \ndefining agency that false positive and false negative rates can be determined and adjusted \nempirically.  There can be significant overlap between affected and unaffected populations. \n \nOn the next slide [page 6] is a graphic demonstration.  On the left you can see the properties \nof a test used for diagnosis.  The unaffected population on the left and the affected population \non the right have very little overlap, so the number of false positives and false negatives are \nvery, very small for a diagnostic test.  A screening test on the other hand can have a great \ndeal of overlap between unaffected and affected populations.  The area to the left of the \ndotted line on the right side of the slide will define what the false positive and false negative \nrates will be.  You can move that discriminator and adjust it arbitrarily and can, if you \nchoose, eliminate your false positive or false negative rates. \n \nWhen these definitions were first applied to pregnancy, it allowed us to identify patients at \nrisk for chromosome issues in pregnancy.  The first definition of this was work we did when \nwe defined the California Alpha Feto-Protein Screening Program [page 7].  This was defined \nby the Department of Public Health in the State of California—the genetics disease branch.  \nAt that time, it became obvious that patients who were carrying a pregnancy affected with \nspina bifida could be identified by measuring in the mother's serum a protein called alpha \nfeto-protein.  When those babies were identified, it became clear that their health could be \nimproved by delivering them in a center where they could be addressed immediately and \nsurgically corrected.  What was not anticipated was that the alpha feto-protein test, back in \nthe 1980s, also allowed us to identify patients at risk for a baby with Down syndrome.  Since \nthat time, in the last 30 years we have become much better at identifying these patients using \ndifferent screening tools.  The ability to provide this to patients has become routine and \ncustomary.  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the Society \nfor Maternal-Fetal Medicine, and the National Society of Genetic Counselors have suggested \nthat all patients be provided with the ability to identify what their risks are in pregnancy for \na chromosome number abnormality.  \n \nThe ability to do that is further expanded by our current development of DNA sequencing \ntechnologies [page 8].  This ability has become routine and customary and has allowed us to \nidentify—with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity—pregnancies that are potentially \nat risk for chromosomal abnormality.  We do that by taking advantage of the biology of the \npregnancy.  The interface between the placenta and the maternal uterine wall is dynamic \n[page 9].  The placenta is fetal in origin and because of the dynamism of this interface, some \ncells that are placental in origin will grow, divide, and some will die.  If that placental cell \ndies and releases its contents, some of the fetal DNA indicated in white here, can cross into \nmaternal circulation and we can identify, separate, and sequence the DNA of the fetus from \na maternal blood sample.  Remember, a maternal blood sample is not an at-risk procedure \nand does not put the pregnancy at risk at all.  In this setting, we know fetal DNA has a much \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 10, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \nshorter length than maternal DNA in circulation, and our ability to sequence that DNA has \nbecome available routinely and is offered to all pregnant women for this reason.  \n \nUsing this cell-free DNA-based noninvasive prenatal screening tool, we are able to provide \nfamilies and pregnant women with options [page 10, Exhibit H].  The first takeaway from \nthis is that cell-free DNA-based noninvasive prenatal screening is increasingly utilized across \nall pregnancy risk groups.  For the last ten years it has offered improved detection of fetal \nchromosomal abnormalities.  Second, cell-free DNA-based noninvasive prenatal screening \nhas been extensively studied in the general population with tens of thousands of patients and \nhas  shown  to  have  very  high  positive  predictive  value  compared  to  other  status  quo \ntraditional screening tools.  Third, there is a better detection of the chromosome number \nabnormalities that we can identify than in other screening tools.  That leads to fewer invasive \nfollow-up  procedures,  fewer  amniocenteses,  fewer  chorionic  villus  samplings  and  by \ndefinition, fewer pregnancy-related losses.  It is a safer test for both the mother and the fetus.   \n \nAll major professional societies endorse or recognize this particular tool as a clinically valid \nscreening option for all pregnancies [page 11].  As we know, there is a clear disparity in \ncoverage and care for women based on factors such as age, location, and insurance coverage.  \nWe are striving for a single standard of care.  It can provide better detection, fewer false \npositives, fewer invasive procedures, and fewer procedure-related miscarriages.  In the next \nslide [page 12] we can see that the test is a remarkably powerful one.  Not only is there \na high positive predictive value, which is on the right side of the slide, but looking at the right \nbottom corner, there were essentially zero false negative results.  Of 15,794 patients tested in \nthis study, none of them were falsely identified as negative.  It is therefore a perfect screening \ntool.   \n \nThere are obvious health economic benefits, fewer invasive procedures, improved perinatal \noutcomes, and reductions in specialist referrals [page 13].  My experience with cell-free \nDNA testing in Nevada is that it is very well accepted by patients, by providers, and other \nclinicians [page 14].  It is very easily utilized both in private offices and clinics.  One need \nnot drive all the way to a center to have the test done; it can be provided in an office in Ely \njust as easily as it can be provided in Las Vegas.  There is a very high comprehension of the \ntest's  strengths  and  weaknesses  that  clinicians,  patients,  and  underwriters  have.    We \nrecognize  that  there  is  unequal  access  to  this  particular  test  in  Nevada  geographically, \ndemographically, and financially.  It is such a great screening tool, because, as I said, the \nchance that it is wrong is very, very low [page 15].  We also know there are risks associated \nwith diagnostic testing, and the cell-free test has a very low risk and leads to far fewer \ndiagnostic procedures.  It is, by definition, a safer choice, and the goal here is to provide \nbetter access and more equity in access to our patients and pregnant women in the state of \nNevada. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAssemblywoman Krasner, do you have any additional parts to your presentation? \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 10, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \nAssemblywoman Krasner: \nNo, I do not.  We are available for questions. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any questions? \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nThank you, Assemblywoman Krasner, for bringing this bill forward.  It is very important for \nall the reasons Dr. Slotnick talked about.  I see the access will start at age 40.  My sense is \nthat obstetricians typically offer this earlier than age 40.  How did you pick the age 40 \nthreshold? \n \nAssemblywoman Krasner: \nAccording to Dr. Slotnick, the appropriate age is 35 and older.  As Nevada has a budget \ndeficit, and hoping to keep the fiscal note as low as possible, I asked for the age to be 40 and \nover, fully knowing and promising Dr. Slotnick that I would come back two years from now \nand change the age down to 35. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there other questions from Committee members? \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nThank you so much for bringing this wonderful bill and Dr. Slotnick for a really interesting \npresentation.  Has anyone done any research to see if we stick with the age of 40, how many \nbirths would we miss if we had not left it at age 35?  Do we have any data that would show \nwhat the difference is?  Assemblyman Orentlicher's question is valid.  I had a late-in-life \npregnancy my third time, had to go through all of this and have invasive tests.  We are \ntalking about discrepancies in delivery in communities of color, and we are talking about the \nnumber of births that are paid for by Medicaid.  How many are we going to miss by leaving \nthis at 40 instead of bringing it down to 35? \n \nAssemblywoman Krasner: \nIt is not going to stay at 40.  It is only going to be at 40 for two years until the next session.  \nThen it is going to go back down to age 35.  I asked DuAne Young from Medicaid to give \nme the statistics on age 40 and age 35, knowing we are in a budget deficit.  For age 40, for \ntwo years, it is a little under $100,000.  For age 35, for two years, it is $600,000.  I am hoping \nto get this passed this session just for two years.  I fully intend to come back two years from \nnow and see if I can move the age down to 35. \n \nNathan Slotnick: \nThere is a distinction between what is considered to be high-risk and non-high-risk.  There \nhas  been  a  cutoff  established  regarding  patients  at  high  risk  for  chromosomal  number \nabnormality that has been established for many years, and that is age 35.  The high-risk \ndefinition is one that has been accepted through a number of different societies including \nACOG and the Society of Maternal-Fetal Medicine.  The ability to provide services for this \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 10, 2021 \nPage 27 \n \nnoninvasive test, though, lags in Nevada.  The access for a woman in Elko is different from a \nwoman who lives in Reno or in Las Vegas.  We are trying to initiate the conversation, the \nappreciation, and the definition and understand the science and clinical medicine behind it so \nthat this can be an ongoing and dynamic approach to improving the health care for families \nand pregnant women in the state.  It will not stop here; it will continue, and we will continue \nto discuss it as time moves on. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong, does that answer your question? \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nIt does.  I understand Assemblywoman Krasner's thought process, and I am grateful that this \nis going to be a continuing conversation.  When we are talking about maternal health and \nwhat we are delivering to our communities, sometimes we get caught up on the raw numbers \nand do not consider what it means if we do not institute things.  Are we crunching the \nnumbers to see how much it costs if we do not address some of these issues in vitro through \nprenatal and then end up with problems after birth?  That is something to consider as we are \ncrunching the numbers, but I appreciate this, Assemblywoman Krasner, and thank you very \nmuch. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there other questions from Committee members?  [There was no reply.]  Seeing none, \nwe will begin testimony in support, opposition, and neutral.  [The Chair reminded callers of \nthe protocol and procedures for virtual meetings.]     \n \nConnor Cain, representing HCA Healthcare, and Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center: \nWe are in support of A.B. 198.  I would like to thank Assemblywoman Krasner for her \nleadership and hard work on this incredibly important issue.  Rather than repeat my prior \ntestimony in support of A.B. 189, I will just say that covering genetic testing for birth defects \nis something that could lead to improved outcomes for many of the thousands of babies born \nevery year in Sunrise Hospital who are covered by Medicaid.  On a personal level, after \na positive diagnostic test a little more than a year ago, my wife was able to get additional care \nfrom a high-risk pregnancy center, and today I can report that we have a happy and healthy \neight-month-old baby girl.  \n \nMelissa Clement, representing Nevada Right to Life: \nWe support the amendment to A.B. 198 and we thank the sponsor for adding it.  While we \nsupport testing so that a parent can prepare for a potentially adverse diagnosis, we are \nconcerned that such a diagnosis could be used to screen out babies who are potentially less \nthan perfect.  That is certainly not the point of the bill, and we thank the sponsor again for her \nhelp. \n \nHannah Baer, representing Coalition for Access to Prenatal Screening: \n[Hannah Baer submitted a letter in support Exhibit I].  The Coalition for Access to Prenatal \nScreening  is  a  collaborative  alliance  of  seven  leading  genetic  testing  companies  in  the \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 10, 2021 \nPage 28 \n \nUnited States that seeks to improve access to noninvasive prenatal screening for all pregnant \nwomen.  The coalition thanks the Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services for \nthe opportunity to speak in support of A.B. 198, and the coalition thanks the bill sponsors and \ncosponsors for bringing attention to this important issue of access to prenatal screening. \n \nWomen enrolled in Nevada Medicaid currently do have access to maternal serum screening, \nincluding amniocentesis, which provides some information if there is an increased risk of \ngiving birth to a child with a genetic disorder.  Noninvasive prenatal screening (NIPS) \nprovides the same information through a noninvasive simple maternal blood draw and is \na safer and more accurate screening.  A woman with an affected pregnancy may need to \ndeliver her baby in a hospital equipped with resources to manage a high-risk birth and \nspecial-needs  birth.    The  information  NIPS  provides  helps  to  improve  maternal  health \noutcomes.  State Medicaid programs and commercial payors recognize noninvasive prenatal \nscreening as a sensitive and specific prenatal screening tool that should be offered to all \npregnant  women.    Many  of  Nevada's  surrounding  states,  including  Oregon,  Idaho,  and \nCalifornia effective in 2022, cover this screening for all pregnant women.  These are 3 of the \n18 state Medicaid programs that cover NIPS for average risk pregnant women.  Five of these \n18 states' changes fall into the [unintelligible] Practice Bulletin 226 by the American College \nof  Obstetricians  and  Gynecologists  in  August  2020  which  recommends  the  screening \nregardless of age or risk.  Furthermore, 25 state Medicaid programs cover the screening for \nwomen considered high-risk.  In contrast, currently Nevada Medicaid remains one of only \nseven states and Washington, D.C., that deny this coverage to all pregnant women, even \nthose considered high-risk. \n \nOn the commercial payor side, more than 65 plans nationally covering more than 200 million \nlives cover NIPS for average-risk women.  This includes almost all Blue Cross Blue Shield \nplans, Aetna, UnitedHealthcare, Cigna, and Anthem.  The majority of commercially covered \nlives enjoy access to noninvasive prenatal screening, and this creates a disparity of care for \nlower-income women who live in a state in which Medicaid denies coverage.  In Nevada \nthere is a disparity of care even within the Medicaid program, as all three of its managed care \norganizations provide coverage of noninvasive prenatal screening.  Noninvasive prenatal \nscreening provides better detection of common genetic disorders with a lower false positive \nrate resulting in fewer follow-up procedures and procedure-related losses.  Since Nevada \nMedicaid's fee-for-service program does not currently cover the screening for any pregnant \nwoman, it creates an environment that is less safe for the mother and child.  In addition, there \nis a clear disparity in access to prenatal care for women in Nevada's Medicaid program, \ncompared  to  their  counterparts  enrolled  in  commercial  plans.    Coalition  for  Access  to \nPrenatal Screening members support A.B. 198, as this legislation seeks to reduce the gap in \ncoverage and increase access to prenatal screening for Nevada Medicaid enrollees.  This \nconcludes my summary of the coverage landscape and trends regarding NIPS. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 10, 2021 \nPage 29 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nMay we go to our next caller in support?  [There were no more callers.]  Do we have any \ncallers in opposition to A.B. 198?  [There were no callers.]  Do we have any callers in \nneutral?  \n \nErin Lynch, Chief, Medical Programs Unit, Division of Health Care Financing and \nPolicy, Department of Health and Human Services: \nHopefully everyone can see this slide on the normal human karyotype [slide not made \navailable].  Humans have 46 chromosomes and when they are paired up, there are 23 pairs.  \nThings go awry when let us say a pair of chromosomes only has one chromosome, or it has \nthree chromosomes.  For instance, Down syndrome is trisomy 21, which means instead of \nhaving two chromosomes, there are actually three.   \n \nNow I will share another slide [Exhibit J].  This is what Nevada Medicaid covers for prenatal \ntesting.  These are all optional.  We do not force any women to get tested.  Prenatal screening \nand diagnostic testing are optional.  Screening identifies the potential chance that a fetus has \nan abnormal number of chromosomes.  When a screen comes back positive, there is a higher \nchance of there being an abnormality.  When it comes back negative, there is a lower chance.   \nWithin screening there is a first trimester screen, second trimester screen, and then the \nnoninvasive prenatal screening, which is also called cell-free DNA screening.  In the first \ntrimester screen they take a blood panel with an ultrasound, and it screens for trisomy 18 and \nDown syndrome. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nMs. Lynch, there might have been some confusion.  We are taking testimony in neutral now.  \nThis may have been more appropriate during the presentation.  I received the slides you are \nreferencing,  although  I  do  not  know  if  other  Committee  members  did.    Will  you  and \nAssemblywoman Krasner make sure you get those slides to our policy analyst so they can be \ndistributed to the rest of the Committee. \n \nErin Lynch: \nI was left out during the presentation and this was provided as an exhibit and is posted online.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nHow many slides do you have to present? \n \nErin Lynch: \nJust this one slide. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nGo ahead and continue. \n \nErin Lynch: \nThe second trimester screen also screens for the same chromosomal abnormalities and also \nscreens for neuro tube defects.  The first and second trimester screens are covered by Nevada \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 10, 2021 \nPage 30 \n \nMedicaid.  Obviously, the NIPS test is not covered.  It does screen for one more trisomy, \nwhich is trisomy 13.  On the diagnostic side, whenever a person tests positive for one of \nthese prenatal screenings, the physician is probably going to recommend a diagnostic test to \ndetermine whether that fetus has that abnormality.  Nevada Medicaid does cover karyotype \ntesting.  The samples are collected via amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling testing.  \nWe also cover the FISH [fluorescence in situ hybridization] test which is the same type of \nprocess.  We are in the process, and it is coming very soon, of covering the chromosomal \nmicroarray analysis test.  We do not cover individual DNA tests.  For instance, if you wanted \nto test the baby for cystic fibrosis, we do not cover those individual tests.  We do allow for \nitems that we do not cover to be overridden with the EPSDT [Early and Periodic Screening, \nDiagnostic,  and  Treatment]  benefit  as  an  exception  when  it  is  medically  necessary  for \npregnant women under the age of 21.  Also, at birth, Nevada Medicaid does cover newborn \nscreening, which screens for 31 chromosomal DNA metabolic disorders. \n \nAn advantage is that NIPS screens for trisomy 13.  The American Congress of Obstetricians \nand Gynecologists recommends that all women be offered prenatal screening regardless of \nage, but we currently only offer two types.  This bill would offer a third type.  You should \nalso have information about the fiscal impact of this bill. \n \nNathan Slotnick: \nThere are screening tests and then there are screening tests.  The currently available first \ntrimester screening test will miss 20 percent of all Down syndrome pregnancies and does \na terrible  job  with  trisomy  18  and  13.    That  is  why  we  are  discussing  this  particular \nnoninvasive test.  The second trimester screen misses even more.  The whole point of the \nprocess is to provide a better and safer test to the families and pregnant patients.  Screening is \nnot equal across the board.  Newborn screening has nothing to do with chromosome issues.  \nIt is only for metabolic diseases and single gene abnormalities.           \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDoes anyone have questions for Ms. Lynch or Dr. Slotnick regarding those two last slides \nthat were presented?  \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nI wanted to follow up on something you just said, Dr. Slotnick, which was that the tests we \nare not covering are more sensitive or more likely to pick up abnormalities than the tests we \nare using.  Does that mean we can substitute the tests we are not using for the tests we are \nusing and then address some of the fiscal concerns? \n \nNathan Slotnick: \nThat  is  the  national  approach  right  now—that  we  should  use  the  DNA  test  for  all \npregnancies,  for  all  women  as  a  replacement  for  the  currently  available  first  trimester \nscreening and second trimester screening, which is less sensitive and less specific. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 10, 2021 \nPage 31 \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nIf this more sensitive test was used in the second trimester, and we did not use the other less-\neffective test, could we ask DHHS how much money we would save based on the last two \nyears of administering tests.  If that number is equal to the difference between testing at 40 \nyears and testing at 35, what would that look like? \n \nErin Lynch: \nWe will get back to you on that. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI do not see further questions.  Is anyone available to testify in neutral?  [There were no \ncallers.]  I will turn this back over to Assemblywoman Krasner for closing remarks. \n \nAssemblywoman Krasner: \nI hand-delivered this exhibit to each of your offices.  It shows the prenatal screening tests \ncurrently available to Medicaid recipients in Nevada.   I would like to thank Dr. Slotnick for \nhis excellent presentation and I would appreciate your support of A.B. 198. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 198.  Now we will take public comment.  [There was none.]  \nAre there any comments from Committee members before I close the meeting?

The Chair reminded Committee members, witnesses, and members of the \naudience of Committee rules, protocol, and procedures for virtual meetings.]  We have two \nbills today, and I will open the hearing on Assembly Bill 216. \n \nAssembly  Bill  216:    Requires  Medicaid  to  cover  certain  services  for  persons  with \ncognitive impairments. (BDR 38-385) \n \nAssemblywoman Michelle Gorelow, Assembly District No. 35: \nI am joined by officials from the Aging and Disability Services Division and a member of the \nNevada Commission on Aging who will provide technical information on the bill and discuss \na friendly amendment offered by the Division.  \n \nAssembly Bill 216 was recommended to the Legislative Committee on Senior Citizens, \nVeterans and Adults With Special Needs during the 2019-2020 Interim.  The bill mandates \nthat  the  State  Plan  for  Medicaid  include  coverage  for  cognitive  assessments  and  care \nplanning services provided to persons with symptoms of cognitive impairment.  Alzheimer's \ndisease is the single most expensive disease in the United States, outpacing the cost of cancer \nand heart disease.  Analysis by the Alzheimer's Association calculated the direct costs posed \nto caregivers totaled $305 billion in 2020 alone.  They also estimated that Medicare and \nMedicaid covered 67 percent of the total cost.   \n \nThere  are  a  host  of  early  intervention  and  detection  strategies  that  can  stave  off  the \nastronomical  expenses  associated  with  late-stage  dementia  in  Alzheimer's.    In  fact,  the \nMilken  Institute  released  a  report  showing  that  early  diagnosis  in  the  mild  cognitive \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 15, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nimpairment stage could create cost savings of as much as $7.9 trillion in U.S. health and \nlong-term care expenditures by enabling better planning, management, and care.    \n \nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) covers cognitive evaluation and \ncare planning for Medicare recipients.  In 2018, CMS added current procedural terminology \n(CPT) code 99483 to pay physicians an average of $242 to perform early intervention \ntreatment.  Unfortunately, Medicaid does not offer the same coverage.  Assembly Bill 216 \nseeks to provide these lifesaving services to Medicaid recipients.  By funding assessments \nand care planning, we can get ahead of cognitive decline to ensure those suffering and their \ncaregivers can manage the devastating effects of cognitive impairment.  \n \nAs introduced, A.B. 216 would require the State Plan for Medicaid to cover the nonfederal \nshare  for  cognitive  assessment  and  care  planning  services  for  persons  with  cognitive \nimpairment symptoms.  For families whose members have Alzheimer's, this bill will ensure \nsupport  services  are  in  place.    This  type  of  advanced  care  planning  can  prevent  acute \nhospitalizations which can be traumatic for individuals and their families as well as generate \nunnecessary  expenses  to  the  health  care  system.    I  will  now  turn  this  over  to  the \nAdministrator of the Aging and Disability Services Division to discuss the need further and \npresent their amendment. \n \nDena Schmidt, Administrator, Aging and Disability Services Division, Department of \nHealth and Human Services:  \nWe are offering a couple of small amendments to make minor changes [Exhibit C].  In \nsection 1, subsection 1, we are replacing the words \"who exhibits\" with \"experiencing the.\"  \nThe  change  to  this  language  would  not  preclude  anyone  who  was  self-reporting  from \nreceiving this service. \n \nIn section 1, subsection 2, changes in this section are meant to align the definition of \n\"cognitive impairment\" with medical terminology.  We would be removing paragraph (d), \n\"Judgment as it relates to safety awareness.\"  Also in section 1, subsection 2, we would be \nadding the word \"or\" between the areas of deficiency to clarify that someone could have any \none or all of the deficiencies. \n \nMary Liveratti, Member, Nevada Commission on Aging: \nIt is vitally important that people have access to early detection and care planning.  Dementia \nis not just a disease for older people and seniors.  It is normally associated with those over \nage 65, but the Alzheimer's Association estimates that 5 percent of those with dementia have \nthe younger-onset form and that currently there are approximately 200,000 people across the \nUnited States who have the younger-onset form. \n \nAccording to data from the Nevada Division of Health Care Financing and Policy, known as \nNevada Medicaid, between fiscal years 2016 and 2020, 4,374 individuals under 65 had a \ndiagnosis of dementia or Alzheimer's disease who were already in the Medicaid program.  \nThey estimate approximately 730 people per year who are on Medicaid will be diagnosed.  \nHow prevalent is cognitive decline among Nevadans under 65?  According to a 2015 survey \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 15, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nconducted by the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services, 16 percent or one in \nsix Nevadans aged 45 to 64 reported worsening confusion or memory loss.  We call that \n\"subjective cognitive decline\" or SCD.  It is a condition associated with later development of \ndementia, but nearly half of these individuals have not talked with a health care professional \nabout their concerns.  Not all who experience or report SCD go on to develop dementia or \nneed a comprehensive service, but a review of pertinent research conducted by the graduate \nstudents at the Sanford Center for Aging at the University of Nevada, Reno School of \nMedicine, found that between 5 and 8 percent of those who report SCD go on to develop \nmild cognitive decline or dementia. \n \nIt is so important that we have that early and accurate diagnosis for younger-onset dementia \nbecause we know it affects their work, their finances, and their families.  An early, accurate \ndiagnosis is crucial to rule out other potentially treatable conditions and to get the most \nappropriate treatment early in the disease process. \n \nMy  own  personal  experience  involves  my  father  who,  one  night,  believed  there  were \nintruders in his home.  He called the police, the police showed up, but then he did not believe \nthey were the police.  We had a trusted neighbor come over and convince my father that it \nreally was the police.  As it turned out, there was no intruder in the house; however, I called a \nfriend with the Alzheimer's Association.  My friend told me that dementia does not come on \nsuddenly and that it is a gradual process in most cases for Alzheimer's disease, although \nsome dementias may progress more quickly.  She suggested I take my dad to the doctor.  We \ngot my dad to the doctor, the doctor ran some tests, and we found out that my dad had a \nurinary tract infection that was causing his confusion.  As soon as he was put on medicine \nand was hydrated again, the confusion went away.  \n \nIt is so important that we know that because sometimes confusion appears to be dementia but \nit may not be.  Early and accurate diagnosis can also give the patient and the family more \ntime to make important decisions about financial and legal issues.  It allows individuals time \nto  work  with  their  employer  on  work  accommodations,  disability  coverage,  or  early \nretirement options.  In addition, it also allows individuals to apply for disability insurance \nand supplemental security income benefits from the Social Security Administration.  Of vital \nimportance, it allows individuals across the country to access critical potential trials.  We \nknow that research is the only thing that will help us find a cure for this terrible disease. \n \nThis bill would enable physicians to use CPT code 99483, which is an important tool in the \ndiagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.  With this code, clinicians have the \ntime  to  do  thorough  evaluations  of  the  patient's  cognition  and  also  to  provide  a \ncomprehensive set of care planning services for people with cognitive decline and their \ncaregivers.  This billing code was added to Medicare and Tricare programs in 2018.  There \nare 16 other state Medicaid programs currently using this code. \n \nThis could provide future cost savings and prevent high costs in Medicaid and our other \nhealth  care  services.    The  Social  Security  Administration  has  added  younger-onset \nAlzheimer's to the list of conditions under the Compassionate Allowances list, which means \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 15, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nthose with this disease get expedited access to Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) \nbut also to Supplemental Security Income (SSI).  This can lead to significant cost savings for \nNevada Medicaid.  After a two-year waiting period, individuals on SSI can become eligible \nfor Medicare, and this shifts medical costs from Nevada Medicaid to the fully federally \nfunded Medicare program.  We believe that will lead to savings in Nevada in future biennia. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIs there anyone else presenting? \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nI believe we have someone from the Alzheimer's Association. \n \nNiki Rubarth, Northern Nevada Regional Director, Alzheimer's Association: \nOn behalf of the 49,000 Nevadans over the age of 65 who are already living with Alzheimer's \ndisease, we thank you for your consideration of A.B. 216.  The vast majority of Nevadans \nimpacted today are women, and a disproportionate number are people of color.  I would like \nto share some findings from the current Alzheimer's Association's Alzheimer's Disease Facts \nand Figures report and outline the importance of diagnosing younger-onset Alzheimer's \ndisease as well as the value of care planning and the ways this legislation will help bring \nabout cost savings. \n \nWe know there is a modest financial cost associated with this request; however, according to \nthe Genworth Cost of Care Survey of 2019, the average cost for a one-year stay in a memory \ncare setting in Nevada is estimated at $51,000.  The cost for nursing home placement over \nthe same period of time is estimated at $127,000.  If detailed care planning can take place at \nthe  appropriate  time,  we  know  we  can  help  individuals  remain  in  their  homes,  avoid \nunnecessary  trips  to  emergency  rooms,  reduce  hospital  stays,  and  delay  institutional \nplacement, thereby avoiding additional costs to the already heavily burdened health care and \nMedicaid systems.  Nevadans with Alzheimer's made 83,300 visits in 2018, and the hospital \nreadmission rate for people with dementia was 25.8 percent.  One out of four end up right \nback in the hospital. \n \nPrior to discussing care planning, I would like to address the need to diagnose Alzheimer's \nand other dementias in individuals under the age of 65.  As Mary said, nationwide, about \n200,000 people know they are living with younger-onset disease.  Some are in their 40s and \n50s.  They have families, careers, or are even caregivers themselves.  Since physicians do not \neven look for Alzheimer's disease in younger people, getting an accurate diagnosis can be a \nlong and frustrating process.  Ruling out other conditions is important, as is connecting \nindividuals to clinical trials and possible treatment that might help ease symptoms, improve \nquality of life, and save on other health care costs. \n \nThe specific medical billing code indicated in A.B. 216 gives health care professionals \nsufficient time to address care requirements during the patient visit and put plans in place—\nplans that answer the unique needs of patients with younger-onset disease.  Those plans can \ninclude  making  connections  to  services  such  as  those  offered  by  the  Alzheimer's \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 15, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nAssociation—workshops  and  education  classes,  support  groups,  early-stage  engagement \nprograms, and access to respite care.  If care planning can happen early on, we can anticipate \na decrease in costs further along in the disease process.  In 2020, Nevada Medicaid spent \n$203 million on care for people with Alzheimer's, and that number is predicted to grow by \n36.5 percent by 2025.  We cannot afford to wait until 2025 to look for ways to bring those \ncosts down.  This bill starts now. \n    \nWe sometimes hear from people who are living with Alzheimer's or other dementia that they \nare much more than their diagnoses.  We are urged to look beyond the labels to see the vital, \nvibrant human beings they still are.  If we can empower people with younger-onset disease to \nmake decisions about their own future care needs, including their legal and financial plans, \nearly on in the process, then we can also help preserve their autonomy and relieve a great \ndeal of stress all around. \n \nWe do not yet know what causes younger-onset Alzheimer's disease or how we stop, slow, or \nprevent its progression.  The Alzheimer's Association will continue to invest in research to \nfind answers to these questions.  What we do know is that individuals at any age deserve an \naccurate diagnosis at the earliest opportunity and that developing detailed care plans can help \npreserve a quality of life that makes the future look much brighter.  Cost savings are only the \ntip of the iceberg when we think about the many ways this important bill can help our fellow \nNevadans.  Thank you so much for your time and attention to this important issue.  We \nappreciate your support for the passage of A.B. 216. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAssemblywoman Gorelow, do you have any other presenters? \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nWe have one more who is going to relate her personal story. \n \nAmy Moore Peterson, Private Citizen, Boulder City, Nevada: \nI  want  to  introduce  you  to  my  husband,  Drew.    When  he  celebrated  his  forty-seventh \nbirthday, he was living the dream.  He was a 737 pilot for a major airline.  With a degree in \nengineering, he owned, restored, and maintained a collection of vintage airplanes.  He was an \naccomplished woodworker, avid reader; in short, he was brilliant.  One month after his forty-\nseventh birthday, Drew would surrender his pilot's license knowing he could no longer fly \ndue to the cognitive decline he was experiencing.  I continued teaching for another three \nyears, but I never knew what I would come home to.  He could be Dr. Jekyll or Mr. Hyde.  \nThe mood swings were increasing and depression was setting in.  He was very good at \ncompensating and hiding his condition.  I knew that Alzheimer's ran in his family, but I never \nimagined it would present itself in such a young, healthy man. \n \nI knew something was terribly wrong when the man who had flown 737s for a living could \nnot figure out how many linear feet of irrigation pipe he needed.  After numerous doctors; \nMRIs; scans; tests for heavy metals,  STDs [sexually transmitted diseases], and vitamin  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 15, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \ndeficiencies,  a  DNA  blood  test  confirmed  that  there  was  a  genetic  mutation  on \nchromosome 14.  Another procedure confirmed elevated levels of the tau protein in his spinal \nfluid.    It  was  official;  he  had  Alzheimer's  disease.    They  referred  to  it  as  ApoD-4 \n[Apolipoprotein D] which is a rarer form of Alzheimer's that presents itself in younger-age-\nonset and also in familial cases.  He was only 50 years old.  Drew's mother was one of eight \nchildren, five of whom developed dementia in their lifetimes.  Drew's sister died last spring \nat the age of 69 due to complications of Alzheimer's, and his 68-year-old sister is currently in \nthe middle stages of this disease. \n \nAfter the diagnosis of Alzheimer's there was a flurry of getting the family trust in order, \ngetting powers of attorney in place, and making financial considerations for a man who could \nno longer work even at the most menial job.  I was unable to return to the classroom because \nnow I was a full-time caregiver.  Drew was forced to take medical retirement 18 years before \nhis planned retirement at 65.  He was 47 when he retired.  A friend suggested SSI, and it took \na neurologist's diagnosis in writing and numerous psychological tests, but SSI was approved, \nand he became eligible for Medicare.  That was about a four-year process.  Drew eventually \ndeveloped blood clots, both pulmonary and DVT [deep vein thrombosis].  He was becoming \na wanderer and a fall risk.  As the caregiver, I was living with one eye open at all times.  \nI cracked two molar teeth and was experiencing atrial fibrillation, so the last 18 months of \nDrew's life were spent in a very nice, clean, safe group home.  They attended to his every \nneed, they were wonderful, but they did not accept Medicare.  Social Security Insurance \ncovered about 60 percent of Drew's monthly care and the rest was out of pocket.   \n \nIt was a Sunday morning when I held Drew's hand as he took his last breath.  That was two \nweeks after his fifty-eighth birthday.  My husband of 30 years was gone, and I was a widow \nat age 55.  Everything happens for a reason and I have been fortunate to volunteer for the \nAlzheimer's  Association  for  the  past  five  years  doing  educational  presentations  and \nfacilitating caregiver support groups.  My story is not unique.  The caregivers I work with \nrepeatedly share similar stories.  I urge you to consider this bill before you, A.B. 216.  It will \nmake such a difference to the families who are affected by younger-age-onset Alzheimer's \ndisease or any dementia.  It will make such a difference to have a timely diagnosis and be \nable to form a care plan.  Thank you for your time and the opportunity to share my story and \nto share Drew's story.     \n   \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you, Ms. Peterson, for sharing your story.  Are there any questions? \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nThank you for stressing the importance of providing services for people who either suffer \nfrom dementia or who are caregivers.  How many other states have adopted similar coverage \nunder Medicaid and what existing coverage under Medicaid is there?  You mentioned some \nexisting coverage for people who are further along in the illness. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 15, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nI am going to ask the representative from the Aging and Disability Services Division if she \nknows how many other states have this.  If not, we can get you that information. \n \nDena Schmidt: \nAbout 16 other states' Medicaid programs allow the assessment that is allowable under \nMedicare. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre you able to answer the follow-up question about what is currently covered in this area in \nNevada? \n \nDena Schmidt: \nRepresentatives from Medicaid are on the call with us to answer those specific questions \nbecause I am not familiar with current services that are covered.  I know we do not currently \ncover this one.   \n \nDuAne Young, Deputy Administrator, Division of Health Care Financing and Policy, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services: \nAs far as I know, this CPT code is fairly unique.  There are medical assessment codes that \nwould fall under the evaluation and management (E and M) of an office visit, but this CPT \ncode, as I understand it, encapsulates not only the assessment but also the care planning.  It is \nfairly unique, so there would not be anything comparable other than just the assessment \ncodes under the E and M visit for a medical provider. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nHaving had a family member with dementia related to Parkinson's disease, I can understand \nhow important it is to be able to identify these things early on and get the care and help for \nthe family as well as for the patient.  The more we can do earlier, the cost savings are really \nsignificant. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nI am very appreciative for this bill because before my mom passed, she was diagnosed with \ndementia.  I believe a stroke she had brought it on.  She could not remember subjects; she \ncould not remember names.  When the onset of dementia occurred, I started asking questions.  \nShe was one of ten children and seven of her siblings had this terrible disease of memory \nloss.  Do we know if this is something that develops in families? \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nYes, we know that it does run in families; however, I will call my friends at the Alzheimer's \nAssociation and they will be able to give you some additional information about the cause of \nAlzheimer's. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 15, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nNiki Rubarth: \nYes,  there  is  a  significant  proportion  of  people  with  Alzheimer's  disease  who  have  a \nhereditary genetic predisposition to develop the disease.  They are ApoD-4, which you have \nheard mentioned here today.  It is one of those genes that might predispose people to develop \nthe disease; however, much of the research now is around identifying risk factors that might \nbe modifiable that might reduce the risk of developing dementia.  All of those that we \nknow—a healthy heart leading to a healthy brain, such as good cardiovascular health, a \nhealthy  diet,  good  sleep,  and  plenty  of  exercise—those  are  all  factors  that  might  be \nmodifiable and might reduce someone's risk of developing the disease.   \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nAssemblywoman Gorelow, thank you for bringing this bill forward.  You are doing a great \njob for the health of Nevadans, and I appreciate your sponsoring this bill.  In section 1, \nI understand the amendment and the changes; however, I have a question about the definition \nof \"short-term\" or \"long-term\" memory loss and also about \"orientation as to person, place \nand time.\"  I have done thousands of mental health assessments of folks, especially in the \nemergency room.  Some folks are impaired; they may be impaired because they have alcohol \non board or perhaps a drug on board.  Perhaps there is post-concussion syndrome because \nthey hit their head and need to be evaluated for that.  I will ask them some questions, and \nthey do not pass.  So, is there a time limit on this?  Because that impairment can resolve; \nmaybe it can resolve in a month, a day, or in 48 hours.  To participate in sports, they have to \nbe tested again after a concussion.  Somebody who sobers up may know exactly who they \nare.  They may not initially know where they are [unintelligible] but maybe not the time or \nplace where they are.  I need some clarification because I do not see it here.  I do not know if \nit is defined in statute.  I understand where you are trying to get to, but there are other cases \nwhere a patient would fall under that.  Is there some clarification? \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nYou are right.  There are a lot of other conditions that can also show some memory lapse.  \nI would need to talk to our legal counsel and get clarification on that.  Maybe we need to \ninclude that in an amendment. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nUnfortunately, we do not have our legal counsel available as she is working to draft our \nremaining bill draft requests; however, I would encourage you to reach out to legal.  I am \nsure our policy analyst is also taking notes.  \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank you for that, because I think it needs to be clarified to make sure we are reaching out \nto the folks who we need to be reaching out to.  I am very supportive of this.  As everyone \nknows,  I  am  a  fiscal  conservative  and  I  like  the  fact  that  early  diagnosis  and  early \nintervention will limit and perhaps delay time of admission.  Once they are in the hospital, as \nwas quoted earlier, the cost to care for these folks doubles, not to mention quality of life.   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 15, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nDo you know the number of folks on Medicaid who are currently in extended facilities with \nthe diagnosis of mental or cognitive impairment?  Certainly, I have taken care of folks when \nI was director of a long-term care facility; they were in that facility because they qualified for \nMedicaid and they had significant mental impairment.  That may not have been the cognitive \nimpairment definition, because that is why we are changing the CPT code, but they had other \nmental impairment such as Alzheimer's.   \n \nDuAne Young: \nI do not currently have that information.  Data provided to us stated that approximately \n8 percent of Nevadans are roughly in this cognitive decline; however, we looked at an age \nrange of 55- to 64-year-olds.  They will be paid for solely by Medicare after age 65, as you \nare aware.  We looked at those adults who were actively seeking doctor's visits and having \nprimary care visits, and then took a percentage of those who might use this test.  We can look \nat the numbers of those who are in our facilities.  If you would like, we can look at what that \nwould do in terms of the relation of the fiscal note for those individuals if they were caught \nearlier or the length of time they have spent in our facilities. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank you for that.  I know this is a policy committee, and I really like the policy, but I feel \nwe need to clarify who we would be covering.  Of course, when it gets to the money \ncommittee, we will need those numbers, so that would be very helpful. \n \nAgain, thank you, Assemblywoman Gorelow, for bringing this bill forward.  I want to also \nacknowledge all those who have reached out to me with their personal stories and the ones \nwho testified today. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there further questions?  [There were none.]  Seeing none, we will take testimony in \nsupport of Assembly Bill 216.  [The Chair reminded callers of the protocol and procedures \nfor virtual meetings.]  \n \nBarry Gold, Director of Government Relations, AARP Nevada: \nPublic policy at AARP says that we support interventions aimed at preventing or reducing \ncognitive decline.  You heard from the other speakers about the cost, the numbers, the \npeople, the planning, the services, all those items in the assessments, and that is all great.  \nWhat I want to talk about is the humanity of this—the human impact.  Many years ago, I was \na facilitator for one of the first groups for adult children of Alzheimer's disease in the state of \nArizona.  A lot of the time they would talk about \"good times\" or \"good days.\"  I am \nmentioning this because I want to expand on what Mrs. Peterson said.  We all know someone \nwho has had Alzheimer's.  We all have known people who have had other diseases that took \nthem too early, and the question is—not only for the person involved, but for the family \nmembers and the caregiver—What would you give to have one more good day, one more \ngood time with your family member?  Think about that.  With this bill, let us talk about what \nit does.  It would help prevent or reduce cognitive decline.  What if you could get three \nmonths more of good days?  What if you could get six months or a year or two years more \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 15, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \ngood days or good times with your loved one?  What is that worth and what would you do \nfor that?  On behalf of our 345,000 members across the state, AARP strongly supports this \nbill which will help people get intervention, preventing or reducing cognitive decline, to give \nnot only the person but their family members more good days. \n \nMarlene Lockard, representing Retired Public Employees of Nevada: \nWe support A.B. 216 with testimony given by the bill's sponsor and the other presenters.  \nWe think this is a very important piece of legislation and urge your favorable consideration.        \n \nGillian Block, representing Nevada Coalition of Legal Services Providers: \nOur attorneys provide the right to counsel for all proposed protected persons in guardianship \ncases.  We see how A.B. 216 would be helpful in the context of guardianship.  It is possible \nto avoid guardianship, and the assessment and care planning play a role in that.  Cognitive \nassessments are often required to assess whether a client no longer needs a guardian, but \noften doctors will not perform these assessments because Medicaid does not pay for them.   \n \nI will share a quick example from an attorney at the Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada.  \nThis attorney had a client who had been under guardianship since 2008.  Eventually, this \nclient wanted to challenge that guardianship.  Using his own funds, he obtained a new \nphysician's certificate from the same primary care doctor who had originally diagnosed him, \nindicating there was now no longer a need for the guardianship.  Despite that physician's \ncertificate being enough evidence to place the client in guardianship in the first place, it was \nnot enough to have that guardianship terminated, and the court required a new cognitive \nevaluation.  This client was required to pay for a new evaluation out of his already-dwindling \nfunds.  Typically, these assessments range from $2,000 to $4,800.  Assembly Bill 216 would \nhelp guardianship clients like this one who are required to use their already-limited funds to \nobtain cognitive evaluations when it comes to terminating a guardianship.  \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any more callers in support?  [There were none.]  Do we have any callers in \nopposition to A.B. 216?  [There were none.]  Do we have any callers in neutral?   \n \nDuAne Young: \nThis  is  adding  one  CPT  code—assessment  and  care  planning.    It  would  be  added  to \nphysicians, advanced practice registered nurses, and physician assistants.  Anytime we add a \nCPT code or service, there is a fiscal note.  As Assemblywoman Titus pointed out, there are \nsome long-term savings from catching this early, so we will go back and take that into \nconsideration.  This fiscal note is around $900,000 over the biennium, but we are happy to \ncontinue working with the sponsor to get you that information. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIs there anyone else to testify in neutral?  [There was no one.]  I will turn this back over to \nAssemblywoman Gorelow. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 15, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nI want to thank everyone who presented today and shared their stories.  We all have family \nand friends who have had dementia or Alzheimer's.  As a member of the interim Legislative \nCommittee on Senior Citizens, Veterans and Adults With Special Needs, I am glad to see this \nmeasure is being heard.  It is critical that persons with cognitive impairment symptoms and \ntheir families access health services as soon as possible.  Assembly Bill 216 delivers much-\nneeded support to Medicaid recipients with a lifechanging disease.  For the last four years I \nhave walked the Alzheimer's Walk, and it will be in October again this year for those who \nwould like to join me or start their own team.  I urge everyone to support A.B. 216. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you.  I will close the hearing on A.B. 216 and open the hearing on Assembly Bill 217.  \n  \nAssembly Bill 217:  Requires training for unlicensed caregivers at certain facilities. \n(BDR 40-454) \n \nAssemblywoman Lesley E. Cohen, Assembly District No. 29: \nI am here today to present A.B. 217 for your consideration.  This bill is sponsored by the \nLegislative Committee on Health Care which I chaired during the 2019-2020 Interim.  It is \nthe result of a study required by Assembly Bill 131 of the 2019 Session.  The bill required \nthe committee to examine issues related to training for nonmedical caregivers who provide \ncare  at  certain  facilities,  compare  training  standards,  and  determine  whether  certain \nunlicensed employees and contractors should be required to complete a minimum amount of \ntraining. \n \nOur studies specifically addressed training for unlicensed staff who provide care to clients \nand patients in nonmedical facilities such as assisted living facilities and community-based \nliving arrangements as well as unlicensed individuals who work in medical facilities.  These \nindividuals provide  a  range  of  services  from  helping  with  medication  administration to \nassisting with activities of daily living such as helping with bathing, lifting people, helping \npeople eat, and beyond.  The key is that they are unlicensed, so we are not talking about \nnurses or certified nursing assistants, dieticians, registered physical therapists, or other people \nwho are licensed. \n \nThe  A.B.  131  of  the  2019  Session  study  built  off  a  2017-2018  Interim  study  by  the \nLegislative Committee on Senior Citizens, Veterans and Adults With Special Needs which \nconsidered many of the same issues.  It found that some of the biggest issues could be \nresolved with training related to sterilization procedures, sanitation, infection control, and \nappropriate care and treatment.  The A.B. 131 of the 2019 Session study was also influenced \nby Nevada's experience during the COVID-19 pandemic.  According to the Department of \nHealth and Human Services (DHHS), the top three causes of COVID-19 outbreaks in skilled \nnursing facilities in Nevada were:  (1) inappropriate use of personal protective equipment; \n(2) breaches in isolation of infections of COVID-19; and (3) hand hygiene and hand washing.  \nBoth the 2017-2018 study and the COVID-19 pandemic emphasized the need for additional \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 15, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nand reinforced training on standard infection prevention and control and the proper use of \npersonal protective equipment, among other issues. \n \nBased on this and other supporting information, the committee's final recommendation was \ndeveloped with input from officials from the Division of Public and Behavioral Health \n(DPBH) which is responsible for regulating these facilities.  We ultimately decided that the \nbest way to ensure unlicensed caregivers receive appropriate training is to have the State \nBoard of Health adopt regulations prescribing these requirements.  This will allow training \nrequirements to be more flexible and nimble than if they were established in legislation.  \nIt will also allow the State Board of Health to revise requirements as new issues emerge.   \n \nAssembly  Bill  217  requires  the  State  Board  of  Health  to  adopt  regulations  prescribing \nmandatory training for unlicensed caregivers who provide care at certain medical facilities, \nfacilities for the dependent, and facilities licensed under Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) \n449.030.  This essentially includes facilities, homes, agencies, and providers licensed under \nNRS Chapter 449.  It does not include care provided in individuals' homes or in other places \nthat are not licensed by DPBH.  The regulations must designate the type of facilities to which \ntraining requirements apply and establish the required topics of training which must include \nat a minimum control of infectious diseases. \n \nThe State Board of Health must also review the required topics of training at least annually \nand revise them as necessary to address new issues that affect the health and safety of \nindividuals at the designated facilities.   \n \nSection  1,  subsection  2,  requires  DPBH  to  post  a  list  of  free,  nationally  recognized \norganizations that provide evidence-based training for caregivers that may be used to satisfy \nthe training requirements developed by the State Board of Health. \n \nSection 1, subsection 3, requires the person in charge of a facility to which the training \nregulations apply  to  ensure  that  each  unlicensed  caregiver  at  the  facility  completes  the \nrequired training and documents the completion in the person's personnel file, ensure the best \npractices taught in the training are implemented at the facility, develop a plan for the control \nof infectious diseases at the facility and update it annually, and provide a written copy of the \nplan to every resident, employee, independent contractor, or other person who regularly \nprovides services at the facility. \n \nSections 2 through 18 of the bill make conforming changes, and section 19 provides that, \nwhile the bill is effective upon passage and approval for the purposes of adopting regulations \nand performing other administrative tasks, the requirements with which the facilities must \ncomply are not effective until January 1, 2022. \n \nWith us is Margot Chappel, the Deputy Administrator of Regulatory and Planning Services \nin DPBH.  Before we take questions, I would like Ms. Chappel to provide her testimony to \nthe Committee. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 15, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nMargot Chappel, Deputy Administrator, Regulatory and Planning Services, Division of \nPublic and Behavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services: \nThe goal of A.B. 217 is to prescribe mandatory trainings through regulations for unlicensed \ncaregivers in designated medical facilities, facilities for the dependent, and facilities licensed \npursuant to NRS 449.030 that are available for free or at minimal cost from a nationally \nrecognized organization that provides evidence-based training.  While reviewing statements \nof deficiency during the pandemic, we saw ancillary staff such as kitchen staff and those \ncleaning who did not appear to understand the importance of wearing a mask or keeping \ncontaminated  cleaning  cloths  separated  from  clean  ones.    Although  there  are  required \ntrainings in statutes and regulations for unlicensed caregivers depending on the types of \nservices  they  are  providing,  the  COVID-19  pandemic  revealed  a  lack  of  knowledge  in \ninfection control and prevention by unlicensed caregivers.  Therefore, infection control and \nprevention training would be the focus in the development of the initial regulations.  That is \nwhat the bill is trying to accomplish. \n \nThe topics will be reviewed annually and revised as necessary to address new issues that \nimpact the health and safety at designated facilities.  Requiring evidence-based training will \nhelp ensure that the information provided in the trainings will be effective.  For example, \nevidence-based infection control and prevention measures have been shown to prevent and \ncontrol the spread of the disease.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has \ndeveloped some really good ones during the pandemic.  In addition, the bill proposes to carry \nthis out in an efficient and cost-effective manner by utilizing trainings that are free of charge \nor have very minimal cost for nationally recognized organizations.   \n \nOne of the concerns expressed by the industry when requiring trainings is the associated cost.  \nSo, we will work to alleviate that concern, and we believe the way the bill is written does \nthat.  In addition, utilizing trainings from nationally recognized organizations that provide \nevidence-based  practices  such  as  the  CDC  allows  individuals  to  access  training  online, \nmaking it much more easily accessible. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any additional presenters?   \n \nAssemblywoman Cohen: \nNo, we are ready for questions. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank you for the bill.  This is something that came to light with our pandemic.  I am glad \nyou are making sure it will be available at no additional cost.  I need clarification about the \npenalties and fines for not doing this.  Under section 3, subsection 4, those penalties are \nalready in existence, so this is not a new penalty or fee.  These are already penalties for not \nfollowing through on workplace safety.  I want that clarification on the record. \n \nMargot Chappel: \nYes, I confirm you are accurate in your assessment.   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 15, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThat is my only question, and thank you for bringing this bill forward.  I also sat on that \ncommittee, and that was a notable void we had.  I like the wording that it is open enough so \nas things change in the infectious disease/health care world, we can change with them and it \ndoes not always require new statutes, so thank you for that. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nI do not work in health care, but where I do work, there is required Occupational Safety and \nHealth Administration (OSHA) training that talks about cleanliness, disease control, how to \ndeal with separating clean and dirty articles—for instance, when someone is cleaning a \nbathroom  or  public  facility.    How  is  this  different  from  OSHA  training  and  why  is  it \ndifferent? \n \nMargot Chappel: \nThey would take the same training if it was from the same source.  However, OSHA does not \nnecessarily go into our facilities.  We regulate them 100 percent; however, if we have a \nspecific issue related to something OSHA manages or oversees, we send them a complaint.  \nAs the regulating agency, we are responsible for all of that in those health care facilities. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nYou mentioned free or very inexpensive training is available.  My concern is whether the \ncost of any of this training would be on the employees or contractors.  I include contractors \nbecause some facilities may employ small independent contractors or even individuals.  How \ndo you control that?  My second question is why is this not expanded to include those who go \ninto people's homes as home health care workers, and my question about cost being the \nresponsibility of the employee would also be the same.  How do you control and ensure that \nthese employees who generally are not making that much money do not have to absorb the \ncost? \n \nMargot Chappel: \nThere are separate regulations that govern training requirements for personal care agency \nstaff and home health care staff.  We have cited a couple of personal care agencies for not \nproviding the training at no cost to their staff.  That is already addressed in regulation.  When \nwe develop regulations, we can add something like that. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nThe first part of my question regarded those who might be subcontractors at these care \nfacilities.  Is there any way to make sure they are not having to absorb that cost? \n \nMargot Chappel: \nWe can add that into the regulations when we start drafting them. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIt is my understanding reading this that the facilities that would be subject to this are licensed \nby the state division.   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 15, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nMargot Chappel: \nThat is accurate. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDoes anyone else have any questions?   \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI want to clarify that last piece.  When I look at the bill, NRS 442.029 through 442.2428 are \nthe facilities we are talking about.  There is a distinction between the facilities licensed by the \nstate.    I  saw  supportive  living  arrangements  and  hospices  listed  there  as  well  as  the \nindependent center hospitals, homes for individual residential care, and halfway houses.  Am \nI correct when I look at that list of defined medical facilities as the ones being included? \n \nMargot Chappel: \nYes, to my knowledge, correct. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson, I can have our legal counsel follow up to confirm those \nare the facilities if you need me to. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI just want to make sure.  Sometimes, when we talk about defined medical facilities, they can \nbe different from what we might be thinking about.  I think there are only two carve-outs in \nthe medical facilities.  For instance, we might not necessarily think of halfway houses or \ntransitional living as being licensed medical facilities.  I want to make sure the statute covers \nall of those and that was the intent. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any other questions?  [There were none.]  We will now take callers from our public \nline in support, opposition, and neutral on A.B. 217.  [The Chair reminded witnesses and \nmembers of the audience of Committee rules, protocol, and procedures for virtual meetings.]  \nWe will now begin testimony in support of A.B. 217. \n \nBarry Gold, Director of Government Relations, AARP Nevada: \nI am familiar with this bill and its history.  I can remember sitting in Assemblywoman \nCohen's  office  in  2017  talking about  this.    There  was  a  lengthy  discussion  among  the \nstakeholders about which facility, which staff, what specific training, who was going to track \nit, and who was actually going to do the training.  Some of the early discussions mentioned \nthat all this training was going to be done by a registered nurse.  That is problematic because \nwe do not have enough nurses to take care of people in facilities let alone do all this training.  \nThere have been several studies talking about the who, what, where, when, how, and why.  \nLooking at this bill, it allows the Department to look at which facilities we are talking about.  \nWe are not talking about the skilled staff in nursing homes or in hospitals.  We are talking \nabout these other places where there is staff who do provide some of level of care but about \nwhom we are unsure what, if any, training they are receiving.  That is really important. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 15, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nIn 2017 I stated that Nevada is very good in some of these types of facilities as we fingerprint \npeople,  we  do  background  checks  on  people,  and  we  do  tuberculosis  tests  on  people.  \nHowever, sometimes we do not do much more than that.  We need to make sure that these \npeople, if your mom or your dad or your grandmother were to go into one of these facilities, \nwe would be comfortable knowing that the people who were going to help take care of them \nhad some basic level of training on some basic care qualities.  This bill is fabulous in terms \nof allowing those decisions, and there was a lot of talk with stakeholders about the best way \nto do this, to allow that to be done through regulations that would pinpoint who needs to get \nthe training and what the specific topics are.  For those reasons, AARP, on behalf of our \n345,000 members across Nevada, supports this bill and urges the Committee to pass it. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nMay we go to our next caller in support.  [There were none.]  May we go to callers in \nopposition to A.B. 217. \n \nBrett  Salmon,  President,  Nevada  Health  Care  Association  and  Nevada  Center  for \nAssisted Living: \nWe appreciate the opportunity to share our concerns with A.B. 217.  Some have been \naddressed already, but I wanted to get them on the record and hope to have the opportunity to \ntalk about them offline.   \n \nWe are very supportive of improving the quality of care in assisted living and my nursing \nfacility membership.  We have been fighting COVID-19 as everyone else has in the last year.  \nWe have had lots of tough times but have also had lots of successes with infection control.  \nWe have one of the lowest COVID-19 death rates in the country in our long-term care \nfacilities.  My members have done a really good job with regard to infection control, and we \nappreciate all their efforts.   \n \nAs to A.B. 217, we would like to have more clarity as to who those unlicensed employees are \nand how that would apply with the term \"provide care.\"  It reads, \"unlicensed caregivers who \nprovide care,\" but maybe that should be sussed out as to what \"provide care\" means.   \n \nThe next point that we were hoping for clarification on is the definition of the \"designated \nfacility.\"  \"Designated facilities\" is very broad to us, and we would like some clarity as to the \nfacilities that are included.  If it is all of them, that is good to know.  The way it is written \nnow, the \"designated facilities\" language is confusing to us.   \n \nRegarding the training aspect of the bill, obviously cost is a factor.  If there is free training, \nthat is wonderful, and we hope that will be the case with this legislation.  However, when you \ntrain employees, there is always a cost involved because of the time factor, so we would like \nto know more about the length of the training being hoped for in this legislation.  Is the \nannual training just related to general cleanliness and sanitation—such as restaurant-style \ntraining—or is it a CDC training for unlicensed caregivers in a nonmedical facility?  That \ncauses us concern as well as in the standard of care.  We would like to understand more \nabout the intentions of this. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 15, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nMr. Salmon, you are at two minutes, so would you please wrap it up.  I would encourage you \nto reach out to the bill sponsor as well as to other Committee members to follow up with \nsome of your concerns.  Hopefully, we can address those. \n \nBrett Salmon: \nGreat.  Thank you for your time. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nLet us go to the next caller in opposition.  [There were none.]  Do we have any callers in \nneutral? \n \nJim Wadhams, representing Nevada Hospital Association: \nWe followed the work of the interim committee in this regard and believe we understand the \nintent of this legislation.  We are neutral to it.  As the Committee may know, hospitals are \nalready covered under a similar law which is found in NRS 449A.300 through 449A.330, \nwhich was adopted in 2015, dealing with caregivers.  We would be happy to work with any \nof the other stakeholders as this bill progresses and would appreciate being kept on any list \nfor that opportunity.  \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any other callers in neutral? \n \nMarlene Lockard, representing Service Employees International Union #1107: \nThe Service Employees International Union (SEIU) #1107 represents 13,000 personal care \naids (PCAs) who care for elderly and disabled Nevadans.  We are in support of this bill, but \nunder the rules we are offering an amendment, so we are testifying in neutral. \n \nWe have become aware of an industry-wide problem where personal care agencies are \nrequiring PCAs to pay for their own annual training.  This practice is atypical in the home \ncare industry nationally and not supported by Nevada statutes and regulations.  Personal care \nagency licensing regulations, specifically Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) 449.3975 and \nNAC 449.3977, describe the eight hours of annual training that PCAs are required to receive.  \nNevada Administrative Code 449.3973, section 2, paragraph (a) states that the administrator \nof  an  agency  is  responsible  for  \"employing  qualified  personnel  and  arranging  for  their \ntraining.\"  Furthermore, Nevada Revised Statutes 449.093, sections 5 and 7 specify that \nemployees of personal care agencies \"must receive training to recognize and prevent the \nabuse of older persons before the employee provides care to a person in the facility, agency, \nor . . .  and annually thereafter,\" and that the agency \"is responsible for the cost related to the \ntraining required by this section.\" \n \nWe recently conducted a survey of PCAs and found that almost 70 percent of PCAs reported \nthat they have to pay for their own training.  An equal portion of PCAs reported difficulty \naffording to pay for the training.   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 15, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nMs. Lockard, you are at two minutes now.  Can I ask you to wrap this up?  I know you have \nan amendment and it is posted on the Nevada Electronic Legislative Information System \n[Exhibit D]. \n \nMarlene Lockard: \nThis is an industry that receives a median wage of $11.07 an hour at a time when the Boyd \nCenter is estimating we are going to need an additional 5,300 personal care aides.  So, I urge \nyour support of SEIU's amendment. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nMs. Lockard, we were taking testimony in neutral, so based on our Committee rules and the \ntestimony you presented, you are supporting an amendment not currently on the table, so \nI am going to recategorize your testimony as opposition testimony.  I encourage you to reach \nout to the bill's sponsor as we move forward through processing this piece of legislation. \n \nAre there any other callers in neutral? \n \nConnie McMullen, representing Personal Care Association of Nevada: \n[Connie  McMullen  submitted  a  letter  of  explanation,  Exhibit  E].    The  Personal  Care \nAssociation  of  Nevada  (PCAN)  is  not  opposed  to  caregivers  receiving  more  training, \nespecially in the areas of infection control.  Currently, state law requires caregivers have \ntraining before they can even set foot in one's home.  This area does involve infection control \nand many other areas of importance.  Having said that, this is an area where the scope of \ntraining and skills taught should not be a hardship to do so.  Last session, a much-needed \ncultural competency training was put into regulation; this year health facilities are trying to \nmeet that mandate, but the only course being offered that meets the criteria is nine hours and \n$100 a person. \n \nIn the bill, the hours of such training were never addressed.  We have similar concerns with \nthe language of this bill.  The PCAN is not opposed to more training, but the scope of the \ninformation must be reasonable in application in these difficult times.  On behalf of the 30 \ncompanies I represent, I do not have any information as to what Ms. Lockard was talking \nabout, but I would be happy to address it. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nTo clarify, was your testimony in neutral of the bill or are you in opposition of the bill as it \ncurrently stands? \n \nConnie McMullen: \nI am neutral.  I need more clarification as to the way the bill was written.  I do not think it is \nspecific enough. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 15, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI encourage you to reach out to the bill's sponsor regarding any questions.  It appears you \nhave concerns with the language as it is currently presented, so I will probably recategorize \nyour testimony as opposition under our Committee rules.  Is there anyone else testifying in \nneutral on A.B. 217?  [There was no one.]  I do not see anyone else in neutral, so I will turn \nthis over to Assemblywoman Cohen. \n \nAssemblywoman Cohen: \nDoes Deputy Administrator Chappel have any final comments? \n \nMargot Chappel: \nA lot of the issues that were brought up related to this bill can be addressed during the \nregulatory process and generally are.  For example, I did get clarification on my end that we \nare  considering  in  section  1(a)  making  it  applicable  to  all  facilities  designated  in  the \nregulations  including  medical  dependent  care  and  others  without  statutory  definitions \npursuant to NRS 499.0303, which is every facility we license.  However, the regulations will \ndesignate the types of facilities to which the training requirements apply and the other details \nthat were brought up during testimony. \n \nAssemblywoman Cohen: \nWe have addressed these same issues each session.  We have talked about cost, we have \ntalked about who is included, and when we started—because I was not thinking about \ninfectious diseases so much—we talked about how people's lives are affected when they live \nin these facilities.  If you are a senior and you have someone who is untrained taking you in \nand out of the bath, you can be injured.  Obviously, that is still part of the issue, that is still \npart of the bill, but in the meantime, we had the pandemic.  We have seen that infectious \ndisease is a big issue for all of us and in all aspects of our lives, especially in trying to protect \nNevada's most vulnerable citizens. \n \nAgain, we have been working on this for several sessions and we hear these same concerns \nthat we are going to be able to address now in the regulations.  It will have more flexibility \nthan what is in statute.  Again, I will remind you that we are talking about individuals who \nare responsible for caring for some of Nevada's most vulnerable citizens and they often \nreceive little to no training.  Cost can be addressed, as can everything else, in regulations, but \nI think we have to pull the trigger.  We have to get this moving and get these issues addressed \nand not keep punting them.   \n \nI am open to discussing this with anyone who is interested; however, I will remind the \nCommittee that this is an interim committee bill, so if there are amendments, it is not my \nplace to accept or reject them.  However, I will talk to anyone who wants to discuss it and \nleave it to this Committee to decide if you would like to accept any of the amendments. \n \n[Exhibit F was submitted but not discussed and will become part of the record.] \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 15, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWith that, I will close the hearing and testimony on A.B. 217.  Our policy analyst has sent \nout a link regarding interim issues that were worked on, and this bill came out of that \ncommittee's work.  Please review that if you have further questions about the intent and what \nkind of work went into the drafting of this bill. \n \nNow, we will move to public comment.  I will remind everyone to speak clearly, spell your \nname, and limit your comments to two minutes.  Public comment can always be submitted in \nwriting within 48 hours of the hearing.  Is there anyone on the line wishing to speak in public \ncomment?  [There was no one.] \n \nAre there any comments from Committee members before we adjourn?  [There were none.]  \nOur next meeting is on Wednesday, March 17.  We have three bills, one of which is from \nwork done in the 2019 Session, and our policy analyst will send you a link to that.  We also \nhave a comprehensive work session, so if you have any questions, reach out to those bills' \nsponsors or to Committee staff and it will be a much smoother process.  I plan on hearing \ntwo bills on Friday afternoon, so please pay attention to the forthcoming agendas.  We are \nadjourned [at 3:01 p.m.].       \n    \n     \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nTerry Horgan \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nAssemblywoman Rochelle T.

Committee rules and protocol were reviewed.]  We have an ambitious \nagenda today.  We have a work session and three bill hearings.  Agenda items will be taken \nin a different order than listed.  We will start with our work session.  We will begin with \nAssembly Bill 189. \n \nAssembly Bill 189:  Establishes presumptive Medicaid eligibility for certain pregnant \nwomen. (BDR 38-130) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \nAs nonpartisan staff, I can neither advocate nor oppose any measures that you will consider \ntoday.  Assembly Bill 189 was heard on March 10, 2021.  This bill requires the director of \nthe Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to include in the State Plan for \nMedicaid a provision that pregnant women who are determined by certain entities to qualify \nfor  Medicaid  are  presumptively  eligible  for  Medicaid  for  a  prescribed  period,  without \napplying for enrollment in Medicaid [Exhibit C]. \n \nThere is one amendment.  Assemblywoman Gorelow proposes to revise A.B. 189 to:  (1) \nexpand coverage for pregnant women in the manner prescribed by Assembly Bill 193; and \n(2) require DHHS to apply for a waiver of certain federal requirements so the Department \nmay expand coverage under Medicaid from 60 days to 12 months following childbirth.  She \nalso attached the proposed conceptual amendment to A.B. 189. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any questions? \n \nASSEMBLYMAN  HAFEN  MOVED  TO  AMEND  AND  DO  PASS \nASSEMBLY BILL 189.   \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN KRASNER SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow will make the floor statement.  We will go to our next bill on \nwork session, Assembly Bill 119. \n \nAssembly  Bill  119:    Revises  provisions  relating  to  the  Maternal  Mortality  Review \nCommittee. (BDR 40-740) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \nAssembly Bill 119 was heard on February 22, 2021.  It revises provisions relating to the \nMaternal  Mortality  Review  Committee,  within  the  limits  of  available  resources,  to:  (1) \ncollect and quantify data for measuring disparities in the incidence of maternal mortality and \npreventable infant deaths affecting persons of color in Nevada; and (2) use that data to \ninform the policies recommended by the Committee.  The bill also requires the Committee to \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 17, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \ninclude a summary of any such data in its biennial report to the Legislature.  I will go straight \nto the proposed conceptual amendment from Assemblywoman Thomas.  A copy of this \nconceptual amendment is attached to the work session document [Exhibit D]. \n \nThe first amendment revises the duties prescribed in paragraphs (c) and (d) of subsection 1 of \nsection 1 of the bill to:  (1) remove the requirement that the Committee collect data; and (2) \nremove any requirements relating to preventable infant death.  Instead, it would require the \nCommittee, within the limits of available resources, to identify and review disparities in the \nincidence of maternal mortality by analyzing:  (1) the race, ethnicity, and age of each mother \nwho died from maternal causes; (2) the geographic region in which each maternal death \noccurred; and (3) any other variables identified by the Committee.   \n \nAmendment two revises the duties prescribed in paragraph (f) of subsection 1 of section 1 of \nthe bill to:  (1) require the Committee to collaborate with the Advisory Committee for the \nNevada  Office  of  Minority  Health  and  Equity,  Office  of  Minority  Health  and  Equity, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (DHHS), in developing its biennial report; (2) \nclarify  that  any  such  collaboration  does  not  grant  the  Office  access  to  confidential \ninformation.  \n \nAmendment three adds a new section to the bill that makes the bill effective upon passage \nand approval.  \n \nAmendment four adds certain Assembly members as cosponsors to the bill. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any questions or comments on the bill? \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThe first amendment says you will not collect any data on preventable infant deaths.  That is \ncausing me concern over this bill.  We wanted to make sure we had adequate and accurate \ndata on all infant deaths.  There are many deaths that would be determined to be preventable, \nsuch as when a mother has preeclampsia.  If she had adequate intervention and seized \nbecause she was not treated, if the baby died, that would be a preventable death.  Deaths from \ndiabetes because a mother had untreated prenatal diabetes could be preventable if the baby \nwas large at term and died at birth because it was too large and the mother went past due date \nwithout  any  intervention.    I  am  concerned  who  will  determine  whether  the  death  was \npreventable.  With the addition of the amendment, I am not sure that I can support this.   \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 17, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any other comments?  Assemblywoman Thomas, do you have any response to the \npurpose of the amendment? \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nI appreciate Assemblywoman Titus' concern.  The DHHS and I felt we could best address \ninfant mortality with a separate bill so we could identify causes of infant mortality.  This bill \ncleans  up  maternal  mortality,  identifying  those  mothers  whose  deaths  were  caused  by \npregnancy.  We could have another bill at another time to address infant mortality. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have a representative here from DHHS? \n \nVickie Ives, Manager, Maternal, Child and Adolescent Health Section, Bureau of Child, \nFamily and Community Wellness, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services: \nDetermination of preventability is part of the Maternal Mortality Review Committee process; \nit  is  the  heart  of  their  work.    The  cases  are  extracted,  and  the  committee  determines \npreventability.  No other maternal mortality review committee in the nation also looks at \ninfant mortality.  That would be done through a fetal infant mortality review.  Preventability \ncould be discussed in the context of the committee's work. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI signed on to this bill because we need to gather data to prevent maternal and infant deaths.  \nI am in favor of that.  I wanted a clearer understanding of why that paragraph was removed \nfrom the bill.  Thank you for your answers. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any further questions?  [There were none.] \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN BENITEZ-THOMPSON MOVED TO AMEND AND \nDO PASS ASSEMBLY BILL 119. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN GORELOW SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \nI will assign the floor statement to Assemblywoman Thomas.  We will move on to our next \nbill, Assembly Bill 191. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 17, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nAssembly Bill 191:  Requires the State Plan for Medicaid to include coverage for the \nservices  of  a  community  health  worker  under  certain  circumstances. \n(BDR 38-449) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \nWe heard Assembly Bill 191 on March 8, 2021.  It requires the director of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services to include in the State Plan for Medicaid coverage for the \nservices of a community health worker who provides services under the supervision of \na physician,  physician  assistant,  or  advanced  practice  registered  nurse.    There  were  no \namendments [Exhibit E]. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any questions regarding the bill?  [There were none.] \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  PETERS  MADE  A  MOTION  TO  DO  PASS \nASSEMBLY BILL 191. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN THOMAS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nTHE MOTION PASSED.  (ASSEMBLYMAN HAFEN VOTED NO.) \n \nI will assign the floor statement to Assemblyman Orentlicher.  With that, we will go to our \nfinal bill in our work session, Assembly Bill 138. \n \nAssembly Bill 138:  Revises provisions governing the eligibility of certain convicted \npersons for public assistance. (BDR 38-760) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \nAssembly Bill 138 was heard by this Committee on February 24, 2021.  It revises provisions \ngoverning eligibility for assistance through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families \n(TANF) Program or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) for persons \nwho have been convicted of certain drug-related offenses [Exhibit F].  The bill: \n  \n•  Removes a requirement that such persons be participating in or have successfully \ncompleted an approved program for the treatment of a substance use disorder; and  \n•  Provides that such persons may become eligible for assistance by demonstrating to \nthe satisfaction of the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services, Department of \nHealth and Human Services, that he or she is not currently possessing, using, or \ndistributing controlled substances in a manner that is prohibited by law. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 17, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nAssemblywoman Martinez proposes the following amendments to the bill:  first, to revise the \nbill to allow a person who has been convicted of a felony drug offense to be eligible for \nTANF and SNAP benefits in this state, regardless of whether the person demonstrates he or \nshe:  (1) is participating in or has successfully completed a treatment program; (2) has not \npossessed, used, or distributed controlled substances since beginning any such treatment \nprogram; or (3) is pregnant; second, to add Senators Cannizzaro, Harris, Ohrenschall, Ratti, \nand Spearman and Assembly Members Benitez-Thompson and Yeager as cosponsors. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any questions from the Committee?   \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nAlthough I support the intention of this bill in providing access to food and not having folks \ngo hungry, I do not support the amendment; therefore, I will vote no. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any other questions from the Committee regarding this bill?  [There were none.]  \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  PETERS  MOVED  TO  AMEND  AND  DO  PASS \nASSEMBLY BILL 138. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  BENITEZ-THOMPSON  SECONDED  THE \nMOTION. \n \nTHE  MOTION  PASSED.    (ASSEMBLYMEN  BLACK,  HAFEN, \nKRASNER, MATTHEWS, AND TITUS VOTED NO.) \n \nI will assign the floor statement to Assemblywoman Martinez. \n \nOn Assembly Bill 191, Assemblyman Hafen miscast his vote.  He will clarify that on the \nfloor.  That concludes the work session.  We will move on to our three bill hearings.  I will \nnow open the hearing on Assembly Bill 228. \n \nAssembly  Bill  228:    Establishes  provisions  relating  to  children's  advocacy  centers. \n(BDR 38-358) \n \nAssemblywoman Brittney Miller, Assembly District No. 5: \nI am here today to present for your consideration Assembly Bill 228, which proposes a new \nchild-friendly approach to addressing an unfortunate and pervasive issue in our society—\nchild maltreatment.  Between July 2019 and June 2020, Nevada Child Protective Services \n(CPS) investigated nearly 14,300 cases of potential harm or risk of harm inflicted on children \nin the state.  About 3,100 investigations were substantiated, meaning evidence of abuse or \nneglect was found.   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 17, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nFor a child, experiencing abuse and neglect is traumatic.  It can cause lifelong harm to \nchildren, their families, and communities.  Many children who experience maltreatment are \nthen pulled into a system that requires them to relive this trauma over and over as they share \ntheir stories with law enforcement, CPS, caseworkers, lawyers, investigators, and judges.  \nChildren deserve to grow up safe and healthy.  Daily as a teacher, I see how the policies, \nsystems, supports, and individuals that surround children influence their lives. \n \nAs legislators, we have the ability to create policies and systems to protect and support \nvulnerable  youth  who  cannot  protect  or  speak  up  for  themselves.    Assembly  Bill  228 \ntakes a step in the right direction by providing children who have experienced abuse or \nneglect a safe, child-focused environment to receive the services and support they need to \naddress their trauma and begin the healing process.  The bill requires state and county child \nwelfare agencies to ensure children who are victims of abuse or neglect have access to \na multidisciplinary team (MDT) through children's advocacy centers (CACs).  According to \nthe National Children's Alliance, children's advocacy centers provide safety, security, and \na wide range of services for children and families who are the victims of abuse or neglect.  \nGenerally, CACs are community-based, and staff provides direct services to children in need.  \nChildren's  advocacy  centers  use  MDTs  that  include  professionals  with  backgrounds  in \ncriminal justice, law enforcement, CPS, mental health, and medical and victim advocacy to \ninvestigate maltreatment, hold offenders accountable, and help children heal from the trauma \nof abuse or neglect.   \n \nI was delighted to sponsor this legislation.  I will now turn it over to the experts, led by \nMr. Jesse Haw, who will discuss the specifics of the bill, introduce his copresenters, and \nprovide additional background information.  At the conclusion of their remarks, we are \navailable to answer any questions you may have.  \n \nJesse Haw, Chair, Legislative Task Force, Children's Advocacy Centers of Nevada: \nWe would like to start the presentation with Cheryl Cooley from Las Vegas. \n \nCheryl Cooley, Executive Director, Children's Advocacy Centers of Nevada: \nI hail from Assembly District No. 17.  I wanted to explain the difference between having a \nmultidisciplinary approach versus how things used to be.  Let us say a child was at school \nand shared with his best friend the big family secret, especially if it was sexual abuse.  The \nbest friend would tell the teacher.  The teacher would come back and ask little Johnny what \nhe told his friend.  Then the teacher would get the principal to ask Johnny what was told.  \nThen the principal would get a detective involved; the detective would call in the social \nworker; then the social worker would get the doctor.  Before you know it, the child has told \nthe best-kept secret to a plethora of professionals, all with good intentions.  Each time Johnny \nrelives that, the trauma continues to build up.  With the nationwide children's advocacy  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 17, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nmovement, we provide a one-stop shop so that when Johnny comes to the CAC, we have \na team of forensic interviewers using a research-based, nonleading way to interview him.  \nThat way, children are telling the story in their own words and from their own perspective.  \nBased on what children say in the forensic interview, law enforcement can seek justice; CPS \nis able to ensure the children are safe; medical staff can make sure they are all right.  Family \nadvocates can help with money from the Victims of Crime Program so victims can get the \ncounseling they need.  It is the best approach so that children are not traumatized again and \nagain and again.  From having victims telling their story one time, we can seek justice for \nchildren. \n \nIt has been amazing to see how that plays out long-term.  Even if you are able to affect one \nlife, that is an amazing thing.  Here is a link to the YouTube video [that was shown, \nExhibit G] about a young woman who came to the children's advocacy center when she was \nmuch younger [youtube.com/watch?v=r0Box5bQkUg].  You see the positivity that happens \nwhen we all come together to save a life. \n \nPeg  Samples,  Deputy  District  Attorney,  Northern  Nevada  Internet  Crimes  Against \nChildren, Washoe County District Attorney's Office: \nI have been a prosecutor in both Clark and Washoe Counties since 2006.  I was a founding \nmember of the Washoe County CAC back in 2014.  I have been in a unique position to \nprosecute cases involving child victims, both before and after the introduction of CACs in \nNevada.  I am proud of the work the centers are doing, not just to hold offenders accountable, \nbut to treat every victim of child abuse by offering a child-friendly environment where the \nchild only has to tell his or her story one time.  Through the center, they have immediate \naccess  to  victim  advocates,  therapists,  medical  treatment,  and  numerous  community \nresources.  We have seen the tremendous benefit to our victims by offering them free \ntherapy, advocacy, even things like community housing.  We aim to stop the cycle of abuse \nthat many of these victims find themselves in.  I am pleased to be presenting A.B. 228 today.  \nI am happy to answer any questions or address any concerns you may have.  \n \nKathie McKenna, Executive Director, Nye County Children's Advocacy Center:  \nI direct the Nye County Children's Advocacy Center with offices in Pahrump and Tonopah.  \nIn 2020, our CACs served over 175 children in our community who had been physically \nand/or sexually abused.  I believe all Nevada families should have the ability to use an \naccredited children's advocacy center in their own community should their children be faced \nwith such a tragedy.  I am in great support of A.B. 228, and I am available to answer any \nquestions you may have.   \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 17, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nRachael Berg, Program Coordinator, Great Basin Children's Advocacy Center:  \nI am also a forensic interviewer at the CAC in Elko, Nevada.  We serve Elko County, Eureka \nCounty, Lander County, White Pine County, and Humboldt County.  We also serve anybody \nelse who needs our services.  Our mission is to support, nurture, and protect children and \nfamilies  who  are  involved  in  child  abuse  investigation  and  treatment.    We  do  this  by \nproviding a child-friendly environment that minimizes trauma and fosters change.  We are in \nsupport of A.B. 228.   \n \nAmber Joiner, Private Citizen, Reno, Nevada: \nIt is great to see some of my old colleagues from when I was the assemblywoman for \nAssembly District No. 24 in Reno.  It is such an honor to be back in a meeting of the \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services.  The last time I was here, I was the \nvice-chair of the Committee, the position Assemblywoman Peters holds now.  Because of my \nexperience, I know the important work you do.  I am grateful to Chair Nguyen for scheduling \nthis for a hearing today and to Assemblywoman Miller for sponsoring it. \n \nI am here today representing myself as a strong supporter of the children's advocacy centers \nin Nevada.  I will tell you how I became involved with the CACs.  When I was an Assembly \nmember, I toured the CAC in Washoe County.  I was astounded by the incredible work they \nwere doing there.  They make sure children who are victims of the most horrible abuse \ncrimes  have  their  cases  handled  correctly  and  in  a  child-friendly  environment.    I  was \nimpressed by their highly skilled MDTs, how they collaborated on cases, and how well they \nprovided wraparound services to help the children and their families recover from these \nawful abuses.  After that tour, I believed so strongly in the children's advocacy centers and \nthe benefits they provide to our children that I wanted to help in any way I could.  I became \na consultant  with  them.    I  have  attended  two  national  conferences  with  the  National \nChildren's Alliance, which is the national organization that accredits these centers.  At those \nmeetings, I saw how much further along other states were in making sure their children all \nhave access to the best practices used in the CACs.  Defining legislation like A.B. 228 has \npassed in 34 other states.  It is crucial.  I believe very strongly that Nevada's most vulnerable \nchildren need these centers.  Assembly Bill 228 will enable the CACs to continue to thrive \nand to expand to serve more Nevada children.  I hope you will all support the children's \nadvocacy centers and the important work they do by passing this legislation.   \n \nI will pass this on to Jesse Haw.  He will talk about specific parts of the bill and some \nproposed amendments. \n \nJesse Haw: \nI want to apologize for the late amendment.  After working closely with Clark and Washoe \nCounties and the Division of Child and Family Services (DCFS), DHHS, we have agreed to \npropose three amendments [Exhibit H].  Chair Nguyen, I can either screen-share that, or I can \nwalk through the amendments before explaining the rest of the bill. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nYou may go ahead and just explain it.   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 17, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nJesse Haw: \nThere are three amendments we would like to propose.  One would add the phrase \". . . to the \nextent the standards are allowed by law\" at the end of section 6, subsection 1, paragraph (b).  \nThat is clear; we do not want anyone doing anything illegal. \n \nSection 6, subsection 4 clarifies that not every case of abuse or neglect may be appropriate \nfor the children's advocacy centers and that each jurisdiction can make that decision on their \nown  and  independently.    Some  of  the  language  in  the  original  draft  might  have  been \nunintentionally misleading to say that every child must go to the CAC.  There are certainly \nsome circumstances where it is not necessary. \n \nWe propose a new section to clarify how information is shared and what information is \nshared with all MDT members to support the child's case. \n \nI will now explain what the original bill language was.  Sections 2 through 5 define terms of \na \"children's advocacy center,\" \"multidisciplinary team,\" and a \"provider of health care.\"  \nChildren's advocacy centers need legitimate legal status in statute to ensure quality services \nin Nevada and to improve competitiveness and eligibility for funding from state, federal, and \nprivate sources.  As Dr. Joiner mentioned, at least 34 states have adopted defining legislation \nfor these CACs in their statutes.  These terms will ensure that as new CACs come along, it is \nclear they know what they are and what they are going to do.  It also ensures that for grants \nor donations, only legitimate MDTs and CACs meet this definition of national standards to \nbe eligible for funds.   \n \nSection 6, subsection 1 discusses how a children's advocacy center is accredited to ensure it \nfollows national best practices.  Nevada needs to ensure quality services are provided to child \nabuse victims.  Currently in Nevada there is no requirement for CACs claiming to help \nabused children to meet any standards.  Requiring standards will improve the health of the \nchild and provide justice by ensuring that the best possible interview, MDT response, and \nevidence-collection procedures are followed.  This would not exclude any CACs that we \nknow  are  currently  operating  in  the  state,  because  of  the  four  CACs,  two  are  already \naccredited and two are working on accreditation.   \n \nI would like to preface section 6, subsection 2 by saying we worked yesterday and today with \nthe Nevada Justice Association trying to work out language and an amendment they and we \nwould be comfortable with.  We are not quite there yet, so we do not have any amendments \nto offer.  I wanted to disclose that we have been talking with them.  This portion discusses \nhow multidisciplinary team members are immune from civil liability if they act in good faith.  \nMembers of the MDTs are still obligated to follow the rules of their professions.  For \nexample,  a  police  officer  could  not  destroy  evidence  and  claim  immunity  under  this \nprovision.  Further, section 6.2 does nothing to alter the constitutional obligations of a police \nofficer or a prosecutor in a criminal case, including disclosure obligations and finding of \ngood faith that is required to trigger the statutory immunity—actions that are intentional or \ngrossly negligent would not be included.  Nevada currently provides immunity to people \nparticipating in investigations and mandatory and voluntary reporters, but there is not the \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 17, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nsame protection for CAC employees and members of the MDTs serving children at CACs.  \nThey deserve the same personal protections that teachers and other mandatory reporters have.   \n \nSection 6, subsection 3 is about confidentiality.  A forensic interview, electronic recording of \nthe  interview,  or  any  transcription  of  the  forensic  interview  conducted  by  a  children's \nadvocacy center should be confidential and exempt from public inspection and copying to \nprotect families.  Such recordings or transcriptions should only be viewed by the court, \nattorneys, investigators, or experts for the purpose of judicial and administrative hearings.  \nThey should not otherwise be published, displayed, or disseminated to a person who is not \nparty to the proceedings, except pursuant to a protective court order.   \n \nSection 6, subsection 4 encourages access to children's advocacy centers for all children who \nneed them within the availability of funds.  It is important to say this is not a mandate on \ncounties that they must have a children's advocacy center.  It is included because, in an ideal \nworld, every child who experiences abuse or neglect would have access to a CAC.  The \ncapacity of Nevada's current CACs is likely to be overrun soon, as we are a growing state \nand there will be more needs in both rural and urban areas.   \n \nSection 7 creates the Account to Support Children's Advocacy Centers in the State General \nFund for the purpose of receiving gifts, grants, bequests, appropriations, or donations to the \nstate's children's advocacy centers.  The Division of Child and Family Services in Nevada's \nDHHS will administer the Account.   \n \nI will provide a few numbers.  If the national figures are correct, one out of every four girls \nand one out of every six boys will be victims of sexual abuse by the time they turn 18.  \nThere will  be  over  100,000  Nevada  children  who  will  be  victims.    COVID-19  could \nhave exacerbated this issue; that is still unclear.  We are still wrestling with what effects \nCOVID-19 has had.  The most important number today is 12.  That is how many members \nare on your Committee.  You have the power to help these children.  Please vote yes on \nA.B. 228.  That concludes our presentation today.  We are here to answer questions.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThere are questions from Committee members.   \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nThis bill means so much to so many people.  I want to thank all the stakeholders who have \ngathered to support A.B. 228.  I am floored that Nevada was not one of the 34 states that has \naccreditation for children's advocacy centers in 2021.  In my daytime job, I work in the Clark \nCounty District Attorney's (DA's) office.  We see so many victims, and it hurts my heart \nwhen I see little ones who are in the DA's office prepping to testify about the horrendous  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 17, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nthing that has happened to them in their little lives.  Which surrounding states accredit their \nchildren's  advocacy  centers?    Did  you  confer  with  those  states  to  discover  how  they \naccredited their CACs?   \n \nAmber Joiner: \nI am the one who mentioned the 34 states, but my testimony may not have been clear \nenough.  The two largest children's advocacy centers in Nevada—in Washoe County and \nClark County—are nationally accredited.  Our other two—in Nye County and Great Basin in \nElko—are  striving  toward  accreditation.    They  are  also  acknowledged  by  the  national \norganization.  What I was not clear about is that those 34 states have passed statutory \nlanguage to legitimize the CACs and to provide the legal framework for CACs to thrive in \ntheir states.  We are not one of those states that has put them in statute.   \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nThank you.  I appreciate that.  \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nMay I ask questions about the amendment? \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIf you want to ask those questions, that is fine. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nIn section 6, subsection 1, paragraph (b), it sounds as if the goal is to make sure that \". . . to \nthe extent the standards are allowable by law,\" we mean Nevada law.  We want to make sure \nthat if the National Children's Alliance has standards that supersede Nevada law, the base \nwould be Nevada law.  Is that correct? \n \nJesse Haw: \nYes.  That is my understanding.  That amendment came from Clark County.  I did not ask \nthat question, but I assumed the same thing you did.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIf someone from Clark County is on the call, they can answer that question. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nIn section 6, subsection 4 changes \"shall ensure\" that children who are victims go into this.  \nWould this be more like a referral process, coming from the child welfare agencies to the \nadvocacy centers?  \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 17, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nJesse Haw:   \nThey did not feel as if it should say \"shall\" because not every case of abuse and neglect may \nbe appropriate for referral to a children's advocacy center.  For example, they may not need \na forensic interview or involve law enforcement or involve a significant trauma.  It was to \nclarify that these agencies did not have to, all of a sudden, send every single case over when \nthey clearly knew from the beginning that it was not something that needed to go to a CAC.   \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nCurrently, is it a referral process with the children's advocacy centers?  What is the current \ntransition or warm handoff?  \n \nJesse Haw: \nI would like to have Peg Samples answer that question.  I am not an expert, either. \n \nPeg Samples: \nWe work from a referral system now.  Whoever takes the child's initial disclosure can report \nthat to law enforcement or to CPS.  They have channels to arrange for the case to be handled \nby the CACs.   \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI appreciate that.  I have some specific questions about section 6, subsection 3 and the \nreferences to Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 432B.  It sounds as if you are talking \nabout confidentiality, that your goal is for the language to restrict confidentiality to a child's \nmultidisciplinary team so they can talk among themselves.  It sounds like you want an \nofficial firewall around the work you do, the information you have from the child welfare \nagency or the formal court, and all those other systems.  Is that correct? \n \nAssemblywoman Miller: \nAs stated in the video we saw and what we previously addressed—the goal of the program is \nto not require the child or youth to have to repeat their story multiple times.  This was \nbrought up by a public defender's office.  In a case, both sides may need to have access to \nmaterials.  Within the law, with a court order, they could have access to it.  We want \nconfidentiality to stay in there to protect the victim, but if what is revealed needs to become \npart of a court case, it would have to be available.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIs there any follow-up?   \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson:   \nI was not thinking so much about the inclusion of subsection 6 out of NRS Chapter 239B.  \nThe way I was interpreting this, it seemed like there was some maintenance of information  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 17, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nby the Affordable Care Act (of 2010) as opposed to information that was maintained and \nheld by the child welfare agencies.  But if it is just the exact same protections from public \nrecords, then they can set me straight. \n \nJesse Haw: \nJoanna Jacob will be testifying.  May we ask her that question when she testifies? \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nThat is fine.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any other questions?   \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThis  is  an  important  piece  of  legislation.    My  question  is  a  little  bit  addressed  in  the \namendment, relating to the bill, section 6, subsection 4 that reads \"To the extent that money \nis available, the governing body of each county and each agency which provides child \nwelfare services shall ensure that children who are victims of abuse or neglect have access to \na multidisciplinary team through a children's advocacy center.\"  You have eliminated the \nlanguage \"who are victims of abuse or neglect\" so that all \"children have access to services \navailable through the local children's advocacy center in accordance with case acceptance \ncriteria established by each county. . .\"  Do the children's advocacy centers have resources for \nanything that a child would need?  \"To the extent that money is available\" depending on \nmoney—who will determine how much money would be made available for them to be \nrequired to do something?  There is no fiscal note attached.  I want to make sure this is not an \nunfunded mandate.  I understand you want them to provide this if they can afford to do it, but \nthe word \"shall\" is in there.  Does \"To the extent that money is available\" mean if they have \na surplus of $100,000 or $200,000?  I need some clarification on the effect on county \ngovernments,  especially  for  the  rural  counties  that  may  not  have  this  available.    What \nservices then would have to be covered, since you are taking out \"victims of abuse\"?  Does \na pediatrician have to be available?  What services are we going to be required to provide, \ndepending on the money?  Who is going to determine the money? \n \nJesse Haw: \nThe intent is not to say every county shall do something.  It is up to each county.  It is too \nhard to dictate that when some counties are smaller and others are larger; some have more \nmoney, some have less.  For example, Washoe County's children's advocacy center sees \nchildren from multiple adjacent counties that do not have the nexus to put something like this \ntogether.  This includes even children across state lines—we will see anybody we can who \nshows up.  The clarification of section 6, subsection 4 is not to make a county do something  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 17, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nbecause it raises all the questions you asked.  The intent is that when it is time and that \ncounty or municipality has decided they are going to have a CAC, here is the protocol to \nfollow; here is the accreditation to follow; and these are the best practices.  It is nuanced \nbecause there are so many gray areas when it comes to things like what you mentioned.   \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI want to make sure what the legislative intent is.  I think it is necessary, important, and \ncritical.  Because of unintended consequences of bills, it is important to know what the \nlegislative intent is, what the problem is you are trying to solve, and who is going to be held \naccountable for \"when money is available.\"  Thank you for that clarification.  \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nWould you briefly describe what the accreditation standards are?  If that is a long list, would \nyou provide it to our staff for distribution to the Committee? \n \nJesse Haw: \nPeg Samples may know how that is handled. \n \nPeg Samples: \nThe accreditation standards are published by the National Children's Alliance.  They are \nexhaustive because they cover every individual portion of the MDT.  There are different \nstandards,  for  example,  for  prosecutors  in  our  training  versus  social  workers  in  their \ncontinuing training.  If you go to the website at nationalchildrensalliance.org, you can find \nthe standards.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWould you please provide the document to Committee staff for distribution to members for \nreview? \n \nPeg Samples: \nSure. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe will hear testimony in support, opposition, and neutral of Assembly Bill 228.   \n \nJennifer P. Noble, Chief Deputy District Attorney, Legislative Liaison, Washoe County \nDistrict  Attorney's  Office;  and  representing  Nevada  District  Attorneys \nAssociation: \nI am testifying on behalf of the 17 elected district attorneys that make up the Nevada District \nAttorneys Association.  We are in full support of Assembly Bill 228.  Children's advocacy \ncenter teams are there for our smallest, most vulnerable victims at one of the most stressful \ntimes in their young lives.  The CACs ensure children can speak out about what happened to \nthem in a child-centered setting with investigators specifically trained to interview children \nand with professionals available to provide resources for medical and psychological support.   \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 17, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nAssembly Bill 228 will ensure that entities identifying themselves as children's advocacy \ncenters follow nationally recognized best practices which minimize trauma for children while \nensuring full and fair investigations and benefit both the prosecution and the accused.  We \nurge your support on this important legislation. \n \nEric Spratley, Executive Director, Nevada Sheriffs' and Chiefs' Association: \nWe are here in support of Assembly Bill 228.  We appreciate Assemblywoman Miller's \nbringing this important bill today.  We believe that the children's advocacy centers are \nessential to the health, safety, and well-being of children in Nevada who are victims of child \nabuse and neglect.  We support good legislation that helps children, and this bill does that.  \nWe thank this Committee for considering A.B. 228.   \n \nJamie  Rodriguez,  Manager,  Government  Affairs,  Office  of  the  County  Manager, \nWashoe County: \nI want to state my support for the bill, along with the amendments from Clark County.  \nWashoe County Child Advocacy Center was established in 2014 and immediately began \nworking on accreditation.  We were the first accredited children's advocacy center in Nevada.  \nWe are very proud of the program that allows children who have had traumatic experiences \nto tell that story and relive that trauma as few times as possible.  We have opened our facility \nto allow other entities, including counties or tribes in our area, to use it because we think it is \nwhat  is  best  for  the  children.    I  appreciate  the  sponsor's  working  with  us  on  the  two \namendments submitted by Clark County, which we support.  We support the bill and any \neffort to strengthen this program.  When it is appropriate, given COVID-19, if there are \nmembers of the Committee who would like to tour our CAC, I am happy to arrange that.  \nI will show you the facility, the work that is being done, and our efforts to help children feel \nmore comfortable as they go through the process of explaining their abuses. \n \nCole McBride, Program Manager, Washoe County Child Advocacy Center: \nI am also the chair of a state chapter project pushing to have all CACs in Nevada use the \nsame national case management database so we can more effectively analyze our trends at \nthe state level and determine where we can improve services.  I have seen the response to \nchild abuse at the center in Washoe County.  I have seen when the MDT comes together.  \nIt never ceases to amaze and impress me how much better we can serve these children and \ntheir families when we can provide complete wraparound services using all our disciplines \ntogether.  I am very much in support of A.B. 228 and am available for any questions.   \n \nJoanna Jacob, Manager, Government Affairs, Clark County: \nI will try to respond to some of the questions that were raised, but first I would like to thank \nAssemblywoman Miller, Mr. Haw, Dr. Joiner, the state, and Washoe County.  We worked \nthrough the night and this morning with the child welfare agencies and counties on the \namendments to get something together for you.   \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 17, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nClark County's Children's Advocacy Center has been in place for over 20 years.  We are \naccredited and recently went through a year-long reaccreditation process and got the highest \nrating possible.  That is a point of pride for Clark County.  It is akin to receiving the Good \nHousekeeping seal of approval for best practices for children suffering from sexual abuse—\nto let you know what we are looking at.  I know those standards are going to be sent to you.   \n \nThere was a question about Nevada law in the amendment.  The amendment was from Clark \nCounty.  That was our intent—to try to clarify that, to the extent that standards conflict with \nNevada law or things that are coming down from child welfare at the national level—we \nwant to make sure there are no conflicts.   \n \nWe  worked  on  the  confidentiality  provisions  with  our  district  attorneys  and  with \nMr. Armstrong.  The intent behind that is we want to make sure there is permission to share \nwithout criminal liability and proactive permission for a child welfare agency.  The key is we \nhave a multidisciplinary team working on this.  Our team in Clark County includes the Clark \nCounty  Department  of  Family  Services,  the  Clark  County  District  Attorney's  Office, \nLas Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, Henderson Police Department, North Las Vegas \nPolice  Department,  Boulder  City  Police  Department,  Mesquite  Police  Department,  the \nFederal  Bureau  of  Investigation,  and  the  United  States  Air  Force  Office  of  Special \nInvestigations.  We have a lot of people coming together to partner on this process.   \n \nFor the amendment, we tried to address a concern about the section being overbroad.  We \nwant to make sure that we align with the standards.  The standards require us to set protocols \nfor  referral  to  the  children's  advocacy  center.    They  must  be  reviewed  by  this \nmultidisciplinary team and updated from time to time.  That is what we were trying to \nincorporate there.  The language \"To the extent that money is available\" we tried to address \nbecause we echoed your concern.  Maybe it was too broad.  I think the amendment addresses \nour concern.  That is why we are in support.    \n \nWe worked hard on this.  It is always a pleasure for me to testify to the good work of the \nClark County Department of Family Services and everybody who helps us with child welfare \nneeds.  On behalf of the vulnerable populations in the state, it is my pleasure to support \nlegislation like this which is going to help us continue to do the good work they do.  We are \nin support with the amendment.  I will work with any Committee member who would like \nmore information.  Please use us as a resource. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nMembers, I encourage you to contact the bill's sponsor or follow up with Ms. Jacobs if you \nhave further questions.   \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 17, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nJohn J. Piro, Chief Deputy Public Defender, Legislative Liaison, Clark County Public \nDefender's Office; and representing Washoe County Public Defender's Office: \nWe are in support.  We would like to thank Assemblywoman Miller for addressing our \nconcerns.  At this point, we believe there is a conceptual amendment that will be accepted.   \n \nRegarding  section  6,  subsection  3  and  the  confidentiality  issue—we  are  not  seeking \ninformation carte blanche from the children's advocacy centers.  What we are seeking is that, \nshould this information be involved in a pending case, it be made available only if a court \norders it.  Generally, CPS records or something similar are only provided by a court order, \nand generally a court would use them in camera before they are turned over to the parties.  \nThat is all we are seeking here, the same type of treatment for any records created by the \nCACs.  We are in support, but if the amendment is not added, we would oppose.  We do not \nwant to oppose this bill because it is such a good thing.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you.  It sounds like Assemblywoman Miller had alluded to some of the provisions you \nwere talking about.   \n \nDan Morgan, Chief Executive Officer, Builders Association of Northern Nevada: \nThe Builders Association is proud to voice our support of A.B. 228.  By adding the definition \nof  \"children's  advocacy  center\"  to  the  Nevada  Revised  Statutes,  you  are  providing  the \ncommunity  the  necessary  resources  to  provide  a  child-friendly  facility  in  which  law \nenforcement, child protection, mental health, medical, and victim advocacy professionals \nwork together to investigate and prosecute the abuse, helping children heal from the abuse \nand holding offenders and abusers accountable.  It is critical that our community provides the \nprotective, advocacy, medical, and social services of a children's advocacy center to provide \nour children with the opportunity to heal and live a life without additional trauma or fear.  \nThe Builders Association and its members' goal is not only to develop and build lasting \ncommunities, but to support the safety and security of our population's most vulnerable, our \nchildren.   \n \nThank you to Assemblywoman Miller for bringing A.B. 228 forward, and a very special \nthanks to former Nevada State Senator and Builders Association past president Jesse Haw for \nhis passion and continued effort in support of the CACs and his commitment to our state's \nchildren.  Thank you for your time today and for your service to our great state.   \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 17, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThere could have been others wishing to testify in support.  I encourage you to reach out.  \nThere are other avenues available to express your support.  I want to make sure we provide \nequal time to those in opposition.  At this time, we will hear opposition to Assembly Bill 228.  \n[There was none.]  Is there anyone wishing to testify in neutral? \n \nRoss E. Armstrong, Administrator, Division of Child and Family Services, Department \nof Health and Human Services: \nMy first job in state service was as a special prosecutor in the Office of the Attorney General \nin  rural  Nevada—from  Pahrump  to  Hawthorne—dealing  with  violent  crimes,  including \nsexual  crimes  against  children,  and  I  assisted  in  standing  up  Nye  County's  children's \nadvocacy center.  I am glad to hear the conversation today.   \n \nI will answer a few questions about the confidentiality provisions.  The structure of children's \nadvocacy centers is different in each of our regions.  In Clark County, it is operated by the \nchild welfare agency [Department of Family Services]; in Washoe County it is primarily \noperated by the Office of the District Attorney; in the rurals, we have nonprofits.  There have \nbeen some interpretations in the past that a child welfare agency in the rurals could not share \nwith a CAC in the event the alleged perpetrator was not the parent.  The confidentiality \nprovision says you can share that information with the MDT in those situations.  That is why \nyou see the confidentiality provision—to make sure there is as much information-sharing as \npossible among that team.   \n \nIn state fiscal year 2020, we substantiated 267 sexual abuse cases in the state.  That means \n267 children were sexually abused by the person legally responsible for them; that does not \ninclude strangers or neighbors or some other acquaintances.  I want to applaud the work of \nthe children's advocacy centers.  We operate other accounts, like the account envisioned in \nthis bill, so we are happy to do that.  It is not a huge administrative burden for us.  The \naccount would be easy for us to manage.  I am happy to answer any other questions.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIs there anyone else wishing to testify in neutral?  [There was no one.]  I will turn it back \nover to Assemblywoman Miller to make any closing remarks on Assembly Bill 228. \n \nAssemblywoman Miller:  \nI would like to thank everyone on the Committee.  I appreciate your attention in listening to \nall the presenters and those who called in support.  We are still working on the language to \nget the bill to truly represent the intent.  I am happy the stakeholders are coming with such  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 17, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \ngreat suggestions to strengthen the bill.  At the beginning, I neglected to announce that \nDr. Joiner, a former assemblywoman, would be joining us.  There is support from both \nsides—the district attorneys and public defenders—and from anyone in the space of helping \nand protecting children. \n \n[Additional exhibits include a fact sheet titled, \"Children's Advocacy Centers of Nevada:  \nOur Mission\" submitted by Jesse Haw, Exhibit I; and letters submitted by David Goldwater, \nExhibit J; Dan Morgan, Exhibit K; John Packham, Ph.D., Exhibit L, Neyda E. Becker, \nM.P.A., Exhibit M, and DaShun Jackson, B.A., Exhibit N.] \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI will close the hearing on Assembly Bill 228 and open the hearing on Assembly Bill 197. \n \nAssembly Bill 197:  Revises provisions relating to persons experiencing homelessness. \n(BDR 11-682) \n \nAssemblyman Howard Watts, Assembly District No. 15: \nI represent Assembly District No. 15 in central east Las Vegas in Clark County.  With me \ntoday to present Assembly Bill 197 are Arash Ghafoori with the Nevada Partnership for \nHomeless Youth and Tayvon Jenkins. \n \nYouth homelessness is a crisis in Nevada.  On any given night, it is estimated that 312 youth \naged 18 or under in our state are living on their own, in shelters, or on the streets.  Over the \n2018-2019  school  year,  school  districts  across  our  state  identified  1,050  school-aged, \nunaccompanied homeless youth.  The problem is as prevalent in our rural areas as it is in our \nurban communities, touching every corner of our state. \n \nAssembly Bill 197 seeks to eliminate barriers that can prevent unaccompanied homeless \nyouth from accessing the critical health care services and documents they need to exit \nhomelessness.  I would now like to turn it over to Mr. Ghafoori and Mr. Jenkins to explain \nwhy this issue is so important, then I will walk you through the bill and will stand for any \nquestions members of the Committee may have.  \n \nArash Ghafoori, Executive Director, Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth: \nAs Assemblyman Watts mentioned, youth homelessness is a very serious and significant \nproblem in Nevada.  While every young person's story is unique, youth often experience \nhomelessness on their own because of family instability, structural issues, and economic \ninstability [Exhibit O].  Youth homelessness disproportionately affects some communities of \nyouth more than others:  systems-involved youth, pregnant and parenting youth, LGBTQ+ \nyouth, and youth of color are more likely to experience homelessness than their peers.  \nAdditionally,  young  people  experiencing  homelessness  are  more  likely  to  experience \ndomestic violence and/or human trafficking.   \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 17, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nDue to the difficulties and complications of living on the streets or in shelters, histories of \ntrauma, and limited access to resources, homeless young people experience higher rates \nof illness  and  injury,  including  malnutrition,  dental  disease,  respiratory  and  infectious \ndiseases, sexually transmitted infections, pregnancy, substance abuse, and increased future \nrisk of diabetes and heart disease.  Additionally, homeless youth experience significantly \nhigher rates of mental illness.  Homeless teenagers are 7.2 times more likely to attempt \nsuicide than housed teenagers.  Consequently, increasing access to health care for minors \nexperiencing homelessness is paramount to the health of vulnerable young people and the \nwellness of our entire state.  \n \nIn  my  ten  years  at  Nevada  Partnership  for  Homeless  Youth,  southern  Nevada's  most \ncomprehensive service provider for young people experiencing homelessness, I have seen \ncountless young people present with health issues ranging from mild to severe.  In order to \nensure that young people can access the care they need, Nevada Partnership for Homeless \nYouth has partnered with many fantastic health care organizations, including Nevada Health \nCenters; the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) School of Nursing; the UNLV Dental \nClinic, Southern Nevada Adult Mental Health Services, the Lions Clubs International Lions \nKid Sight USA Foundation, and others.  However, many of our health care partners have \nfaced barriers in providing services to unaccompanied homeless minors due to limiting and \nunclear language in Nevada law.   \n \nCurrent law only allows medical providers to serve unaccompanied youth once they have \nbeen homeless for four months or more and does not clearly explain how providers can \ndetermine which youth qualify.  Accordingly, Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth has \nworked with many health care providers who truly want to serve youth in need but feel \nunsure about how to implement the current law correctly.  Assembly Bill 197 addresses this \nby establishing a simple and proven process to verify that a minor is covered by this law.  \nThe verification process proposed in this bill is modeled on the federal financial aid process \nwhich Nevada public schools, universities, and service providers have been utilizing since \n2008.  This same process is also used in a similar health care access law for minors in Maine \nand in a California law helping minors access vital documents.  Assembly Bill 197 also \nallows unaccompanied homeless minors to access care right away when it is needed.  This \ntiming is extremely important, as a lack of immediate care can lead to routine problems \nbecoming dangerous and can even lead to death by suicide, overdose, or untreated illness in a \npopulation already prone to heightened health risks.   \n \nCurrent law allows unaccompanied minors to access treatment from a physician or hospital.  \nHowever, many providers who are available to provide care to our young people are nurses \nand  nurse  practitioners,  physician  assistants,  dental  hygienists,  and  other  licensed \nprofessionals who are not clearly covered under the existing law.  Furthermore, many young \npeople we serve have urgent and important health care needs that are not appropriately met \nby physicians or hospitals, but rather by behavioral health, mental health, and dental health \nprofessionals.  Assembly Bill 197 takes care of this, clarifying that unaccompanied minors  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 17, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \ncan access not only health care services provided by a physician or hospital, but also mental \nand behavioral health, dental, and other critical services provided by all \"providers of health \ncare,\" a category already defined by Nevada law. This will ensure that homeless youth can \nreceive the health care services that meet their varied needs.  This bill will improve existing \nlaw and help youth access essential care, while strengthening the ability of organizations like \nNevada Partnership for Homeless Youth and health care providers to meet young people’s \nfundamental needs.  Currently, 30 states allow unaccompanied youth to access basic health \nand behavioral health services without a parent.  The American Academy of Pediatrics also \nsupports these measures.  This bill will simply clarify and fortify Nevada’s existing law, \nensuring that unaccompanied youth have access to basic health services they need to stay \nsafe, healthy, and able to succeed in work and school, empowering them to transition out of \nhomelessness. By providing minors access to physical, mental, and behavioral health care \nnow, we can prevent more long-term, chronic health issues from occurring, saving Nevada \nmillions of dollars in future costs.  Now more than ever, A.B. 197 is a simple and smart step \nto support vulnerable young people on their journeys beyond the streets to healthy and \nsustainable adult lives. \n \nI want to pass it over to Mr. Tayvon Jenkins, a Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth \nambassador  and  incredibly  talented  and  funny  person  who  will  be  sharing  the  youth \nperspective with you on A.B. 197. \n \nTayvon Jenkins, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada:  \nHello.  To tell you a little about myself, I was born in Compton, California [Exhibit P].  I am \nthe oldest of six siblings.  I am a graduate of Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth's \nIndependent Living Program, and I am an official Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth \nambassador.   \n \nWhen I was just 12 years old, I experienced homelessness for the first time with my family.  \nAfter that, my homelessness was off and on due to conflict within my family and my \nmother's health problems.  I was first introduced to Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth \nthrough their Feel Good Friday outreach event when I was 12 years old.  There I got food \nand other supplies every week.  Eventually, I came to their Drop-In Center for homeless \nyouth where I got help getting my ID, food, clothes, school supplies, hygiene supplies, and \nmuch more.  By the time I was 17 years old, I reached the breaking point with my homeless \nsituation and there came a time when I had no other place to go but Nevada Partnership for \nHomeless Youth.  I was able to move into their transitional housing program, where I got to \neat; I got guidance; I learned life skills; I got therapy; and I finally got to sleep regularly.   \n \nIn addition to experiencing homelessness off and on since I was 12 years old, I have suffered \nfrom asthma my whole life.  Accordingly, my ability to access health care has often been \na life-or-death situation for me.  I know I am not alone in this.  According to the Institute for \nChildren, Poverty, and Homelessness, high school students who were homeless in the past  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 17, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \n30 days had the highest rate of uncontrolled asthma—over two times higher than that of their \nhoused peers.  Due to not always having the ability to obtain my mom’s consent, there have \nbeen times when I have not been able to see a doctor or get my inhaler, which is a scary and \ndangerous situation.  When I was in Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth's housing \nprogram, I was hospitalized with a life-threatening asthma attack, but luckily I was already \nover the age of 18 and able to consent to all the health services I needed to recover.   \n \nI was in Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth's housing program for three years and am \nstill very active in youth engagement and leadership development activities with Nevada \nPartnership for Homeless Youth.  Accordingly, I have gotten to know a lot of young people \nexperiencing homelessness over the years.  Just recently there have been youth who have not \nbeen able to seek medical care for chest pains, who could not seek physical therapy after \na gunshot wound limited their mobility, and who could not get treatment for a serious mental \nhealth crisis due to being unable to obtain parental consent as unaccompanied minors.  I have \nalso  known  of  youth  who  could  not  access important  preventive  and  other  health  care \nservices offered by Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth's partners, including dental \ncleanings, physical health checkups and screenings, and vision tests, because they could not \nconsent to these services themselves as unaccompanied minors.  This is especially important \nright now with COVID-19, as homeless minors have been turned away from COVID-19 \ntesting  because  they  have  been  unable  to  obtain  guardian  consent,  putting  not  only \nthemselves but also youth, staff, and others at risk.  Assembly Bill 197 would make a huge \ndifference  for  youth  like  me,  allowing  unaccompanied  homeless  minors  to  access  the \nphysical, mental, and behavioral health care they need.   \n \nI graduated from Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth's housing program, and now I have \na job and my own place.  I can tell you it is difficult enough to try to navigate homelessness \nas a youth and to do everything you need to do to succeed in school, get a job, and eventually \nmove into permanent housing, but having to do all of that with untreated health issues makes \nit almost impossible. By passing this bill, you can make sure that unaccompanied minors can \nget the health care they need to survive, thrive, and build a better future for themselves and \ntheir communities.  Thank you for your time. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you, Mr. Jenkins, you did a wonderful job in your first time testifying or presenting \nhere.  We appreciate your sharing your story.  I know it is very personal, and it is not always \neasy to relive that. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 17, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \nAssemblyman Watts: \nWe do not have anyone else presenting, but I will walk you through the bill, then be open to \nquestions.  Section 1, subsection 1 removes the requirement that a young person be homeless \nfor four months before he or she can access health care without consent of a parent or \nguardian, allowing unaccompanied homeless minors to access care as soon as needs are \nidentified.  Subsection 2 assists health care providers in determining when this statute applies \nby establishing a clear and simple process to verify when a minor is an unaccompanied \nhomeless youth.  This process is tried-and-true from our federal financial aid procedures and \nother processes and allows options such as written statements from service providers, school \nhomeless  liaisons  under  the  McKinney-Vento  Homeless  Assistance  Act,  or  attorneys \nrepresenting the youth. \n \nSection 1, subsection 3 clarifies that unaccompanied minors can access not only physical \nhealth care services provided by a physician or hospital, but also mental and behavioral \nhealth, dental, and other critical services currently defined in statute under the inclusive term \n\"provider of health care.\"  This will ensure that homeless youth can receive the health care \nservices  that  meet  their  varied  needs,  including  preventive  care.    Subsection  4  makes \nconforming language changes and clarifies that while a provider must ask for the minor's \nconsent to communicate with parents or guardians, the provider cannot delay or deny care to \nthe young person if the young person refuses that consent. \n \nSection 2, subsection 5, paragraph (a) improves on Assembly Bill 363 of the 80th Session by \nclarifying that people experiencing homelessness can get a fee waiver for birth certificates \nwithout the unnecessary barrier of having to access a notary public.   \n \nThat concludes the walk-through.  We would be glad to answer any questions the Committee \nmay have.   \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank you, Assemblyman Watts, and presenters for being here, especially for sharing your \npersonal story.  Personal stories are always difficult to share.  We appreciate that you shared \nthat with us and have given us your trust.   \n \nThis is the fourth session I have been in this building.  Many of my bills have worked to \nclarify what a provider is and added language to include nurse practitioners and physician \nassistants.  I have been the emergency room doctor when a minor came in.   I could not take \ncare of the minor until we contacted a parent—unless it was a life-threatening situation.  The \npatient sat there for hours.  This bill is important.  My question regards section 1, subsection \n1, paragraph (d).  It says, \"Is, in the judgment of a provider of health care, in danger of \nsuffering  a  serious  health  hazard  if  health  care  services  are  not  provided.\"    Is  that  an \noversight?  Would you want to take the opportunity to update the language there also?  We \nhave been trying to go through all our Nevada Revised Statutes to remove the word just \n\"physician\" in that part.  Was that intentional, or was it an oversight? \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 17, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \nAssemblyman Watts: \nThe intent in the original drafting of the bill was to specifically focus on the provisions \nrelated to accessing health care for homeless youth.  As you can see, there are some other \nprovisions in section 1, subsection 1, paragraphs (b), (c), and (d).  If it is the Committee's \ninterest to expand the terminology from \"physician\" to cover other practitioners, you could \nmake those decisions.  We would be open to entertaining that.  It was not a deliberate \nomission; we simply left the rest of the statute alone if it did not deal specifically with access \nto health care for homeless youth. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI would hate to miss an opportunity to update the statute to what we see as providers in this \nday  and  age.    Now,  in  the  emergency  room,  we  have  physician  assistants  and  nurse \npractitioners.  I think this is a good opportunity to catch that when we see it and update the \nlanguage.  Thank you for that consideration. \n \nAssemblyman Watts: \nIf it is the Committee's will to make that adjustment, we are completely open to it.  I forgot to \nmention that Clark County is presenting an amendment.  I will let them speak to that during \ntheir supportive testimony, but we consider their amendment friendly. \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nThis is a great bill, and I am supporting it.  I would like to suggest an update in part of \nthe statute.  In section 1, subsection 1, paragraph (c) refers to one of the categories of \neligibility as a mother or one who has borne a child.  That was written in 1975, before the \nU.S. Supreme Court fully developed equal protection on mothers and fathers.  Today, the \nCourt would say you cannot distinguish between mothers and fathers when it comes to \nraising children, so we should change that to \"parent.\" \n \nAssemblyman Watts: \nThank you for your comments.  If it is the Committee's will, we would gladly consider that \namendment as well.  \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any other questions?  [There were none.]  At this time, we will begin hearing \ntestimony in support, opposition, and neutral of Assembly Bill 197. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 17, 2021 \nPage 27 \n \nMinnie Wood, Private Citizen, Las Vegas Nevada: \nThank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  speak  in  support  of  A.B.  197  today.    I  am  a  nurse \npractitioner.  I practice at a Federally Qualified Health Center called First Person Care Clinic \nin downtown Las Vegas.  I also teach at the UNLV School of Nursing.  I am speaking for \nmyself today.   \n \nI support A.B. 197 because it reduces barriers for unaccompanied homeless minors to access \nthe health care they need at the time they need it.  In my time working with nursing students \nand clients of Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth, I have encountered many homeless \nyouth who could not access essential care when they needed it, due to restrictions in the law \nor health care providers' understanding of that law.  No unaccompanied homeless minor \nshould have to delay important care or screening for things like a tooth abscess, a suspected \nor confirmed sexually transmitted infection, COVID-19 testing, or a mental health issue.  \nRemoving the barriers to getting adequate care through strengthening existing law, removing \nthe four-month wait, clarifying that youth can access all health care providers, and helping \nhealth care providers implement the law correctly is an essential step in the right direction for \nthe  state  of  Nevada.    I  have  seen  too  many  health  care  providers  refuse  care  to \nunaccompanied homeless youth for fear they would be violating the law.  Assembly Bill 197 \nmakes  the  verification  process  simpler  and  aligns  with  other  similar  processes  such  as \napplying for federal financial aid.   \n \nAs a nurse practitioner who works with vulnerable communities, I regularly see the results of \npatients having poor access to quality health care throughout their lives.  As a nurse educator, \nI teach my students about population-level interventions that can improve health—not just \nfor individuals, but for large groups of people and places.  Assembly Bill 197 is one such \npolicy measure that can really make a difference for our community of unaccompanied \nhomeless youth and the people who serve and maintain relationships with them.  I hope you \nwill join me in supporting A.B. 197.  Thank you for your attention. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you for your testimony in support.  We can go to our next caller. \n \nGwen  Migita,  Vice  President,  Social  Impact,  Sustainability,  Diversity,  Equity,  and \nInclusion, Caesars Entertainment: \nAs a gay Asian/Pacific Islander, I deeply feel the trauma and fear of home-insecure youth \n[Exhibit Q].  It tends to be a living hell for some who are lured into labor and sex trafficking \nproviding, at best, daily survival for basic needs.   \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 17, 2021 \nPage 28 \n \nCaesars Entertainment is supportive of A.B. 197.  Credit goes to Nevada Partnership for \nHomeless Youth for working on this bill and arming me with the expertise to articulate the \npolicy  gap.    Several  years  ago,  I  sought  out  Nevada  Partnership  for  Homeless  Youth, \nImpactNV,  Dr.  Halleh  Seddighzadeh  at  ARMAN  [Asylee  Refugee  Migrant  Assistance \nNetwork], St Jude’s Ranch for Children, and the Asian Community Development Council to \nhelp  Caesars  develop  a  social  impact  blueprint  for  southern  Nevada.    We  looked  at \nintersectional issues in trafficking, homelessness, and immigration integration.  We identified \nroot solutions such as mental health and a systemic long-term strategy to address the region’s \nmost pressing social issues. \n \nCaesars wanted to orchestrate a coalition-based strategy that would augment, not duplicate, \nthe good work among hundreds of service providers like the ones on the Policy Council on \nHomelessness.  Today, Caesars cochairs the first Nevada Resorts Association's Corporate \nSocial Responsibility Coalition which represents members and suppliers to hospitality.  We \nalso invested in need-gap strategies and social equity work for ImpactNV.  Both groups \nprioritize homelessness as a key issue for collaboration. \n \nCaesars remains committed to playing a leadership role in supporting vulnerable populations.  \nIn 2020, even through business closures and a merger, the Caesars Foundation gifted over \n$1 million to communities in which we serve.  This week, we are holding our first national \nHERO employee volunteer event in person in over a year.  We are building thousands of \nwellness  and  homeless  hygiene  kits  with  LULAC  [League  of  United  Latin  American \nCitizens],  Clean  the  World,  and  the  National  Organization  of  Black  Law  Enforcement \nExecutives.  Our Reno, Tahoe, Laughlin, and Las Vegas team members are participating in \nthis effort.  I am optimistic that A.B. 197 will help us close a gap to better supporting \nNevada’s homeless youth.   \n \nJoanna Jacob, Manager, Government Affairs, Clark County: \nAs Assemblyman Watts testified, we put in an amendment to this bill which is considered \nfriendly [Exhibit R].  We want to thank Assemblyman Watts and Mr. Ghafoori for their work \nwith us on this bill.  We are in support.  One of my jobs at Clark County is to balance \ndifferent departments when we take positions on bills.  We support this bill because we see \na role for us to work with the Partnership, especially under the simplified procedure in place \nthat allows us to provide documentation for social services for a youth who is homeless so \nthe  Partnership  can  obtain  care.    The  purpose  of  our  amendment  is,  from  a  technical \nperspective, to recognize the circumstances under which a child welfare agency may be \nresponsible for the legal custody and decision-making for medical care for the child who \ninteracts with our system.  Such an agency is not considered a guardian or a parent, but rather \na custodian at certain points in the interaction.  For valid policy reasons, we understand why \nthere should be a reduction in barriers to care.  Agencies wanted to be treated on par with \nparents and legal guardians in this bill.  We support the reduction in barriers.   \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 17, 2021 \nPage 29 \n \nWe support this bill and the process that is put in place.  It is critical to us that we try \nto reduce  those  barriers,  and  we  work  with  everybody  in  our  community  to  connect \nvulnerable populations to care.  It is in that spirit that we are here in support with the \namendment.  We know there is further support from Washoe County.  They will also testify \nin support of this amendment. \n \nPatricia  Julianelle,  Senior  Strategist,  Program  Advancement  and  Legal  Affairs, \nSchoolHouse Connection: \nSchoolHouse Connection is a national nonprofit organization [Exhibit S].  For a decade, \nI have worked on state laws similar to A.B. 197 in a dozen states.  Based on that experience, \nI feel comfortable stating that A.B. 197 will save lives.  That is not hyperbole.  It also will \nhelp young people focus on their goals of education, employment, and independence rather \nthan having to expend tremendous amounts of energy on their most basic physical and \nmental health.  Other speakers have explained this far more eloquently than I can, so in the \ninterest of brevity, I will state that Nevada's existing law took an important step forward to \nprotect the health and safety of young people, and A.B. 197 improves it.  It makes it clearer, \neasier for health care providers to implement, and easier for youth to be able to benefit from.  \nShould this law pass, it would be a law that I will use as a model in my work in other states.  \nI applaud Assemblyman Watts for sponsoring this, and I hope this Committee will support it.  \nI am grateful for the opportunity to speak.  \n \nPamela Girgis, A.P.R.N., C.P.N.P., Nevada Children's Health Project, Nevada Health \nCenters: \nI am a certified pediatric nurse practitioner and a medical provider for Children's Health Fund \nand Nevada Health Centers mobile medical van that serves homeless, sex-trafficked, and \nrefugee children and youth.  Since 2018, our team has been providing free health care to \nhomeless youth in partnership with Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth.   \n \nMany of the homeless youth we see on a weekly basis are unable to access health care \nservices due to the restrictions and wait times on consent laws for homeless youth.  I have \nseen many youths unable to access behavioral and mental health services.  Many homeless \nyouths suffer from depression and multiple previous traumas.  Restricting care increases the \nrisk of suicide and potential harm to these youths.  With current restrictions, youth are often \nnot able to access specialty health care services either.  Our team is seeing, time and time \nagain, how this has negatively impacted many youths in need of medical services.  A recent \nexample of this is a homeless youth with uncontrolled diabetes.  He was in desperate need of \nreferral and care of endocrinology for an insulin pump and better titration of his insulin.   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 17, 2021 \nPage 30 \n \n \nBecause  of  the  four-month  rule,  care  was  delayed  and  that  resulted  in  multiple \nhospitalizations for him, risking his life and resulting in his missing work and losing his job, \nsetting him back further.  By being able to provide essential health care services weekly to \nhomeless youth, I have seen countless stories of success where basic health care services to \ntreat asthma, depression, diabetes, and other health conditions have given our youth hope and \na new lease on life.   \n \nI urge you to consider eliminating the four-month wait period and broadening the language of \nwho can provide care for homeless youth—not just on an emergency care basis.  Your action \ncould mean life or death for the many homeless youth of Las Vegas.  Thank you for your \ntime. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any other callers in support? \n \nKatie Ryan, System Director, Nevada Government Relations, Dignity Health-St. Rose \nDominican: \nI am also a member of the Policy Council on Homelessness with the Nevada Homeless \nAlliance.  I wanted to go on the record in support of A.B. 197 as an \"us, too.\"  I also wanted \nto add we are glad this oversight will be remedied by passage of this bill.  I wanted to thank \nthe Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth and Assemblyman Watts for advocating on this \nimportant issue.  I am available for any questions.   \n \nTessyn Opferman, representing Nevada Women's Lobby: \nWe want to thank Assemblyman Watts for bringing forward this legislation.  Homeless \nminors  face  high  levels  of  injury,  sexual  exploitation,  and  more.    It  is  critical  that \nunaccompanied homeless youth have access to health care and services that will keep them \nsafe, help keep them off the streets, and get them stable housing and support.  We urge your \nsupport and thank you for your time. \n \nEmily Paulsen, M.S.W., Executive Director, Nevada Homeless Alliance: \nThank you for considering this important bill.  The Nevada Homeless Alliance chairs the \nPolicy Council on Homelessness, which is a cross-sector coalition that brings advocacy, \nnonprofits,  business,  and  academic  sectors  together  to  advance  policy  solutions  to  end \nhomelessness [Exhibit T].  We are in support of Assembly Bill 197.  One of our top policy \nfocuses is to improve access and equity in services for people experiencing homelessness.  \nNevada has one of the highest rates of youth homelessness in the nation, and, as you heard \nfrom Mr. Ghafoori and Mr. Jenkins, these youth are particularly vulnerable and in need of \naccess to health care services, including behavioral health care.  Under current Nevada law,  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 17, 2021 \nPage 31 \n \nthe delays in care and access to services hurt youth during a critical window of time for \nyoung people in crisis.  Assembly Bill 197 is a simple and smart step to keep youth safe and \nhealthy.  We urge you to support this legislation.  Thank you. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI will take one last caller in support. \n \nJamie  Rodriguez,  Manager,  Government  Affairs,  Office  of  the  County  Manager, \nWashoe County: \nWe are supportive of the bill, especially with the friendly amendment from Clark County.  \nWe  appreciate  the  bill  sponsors  working  on  those  concerns  and  accepting  the  friendly \namendment. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAt this time, I will close testimony in support of Assembly Bill 197.  If there are any \nadditional callers on the line to testify in support, I would encourage you to submit your \nwritten documentation regarding that.  With that, we will go to testimony in opposition of \nAssembly Bill 197.  [There was none.]  Are there any callers in neutral? \n \nAlexis  Tucey,  Deputy  Administrator,  Community  Services,  Division  of  Child  and \nFamily Services, Department of Health and Human Services: \nI am here to testify in neutral on A.B. 197.  We appreciate the bill and the shared efforts to \nhelp transitional aged youth and the homeless youth population and are thankful for the \namendments Clark County submitted.  We appreciate that statutes can be unclear.  It is a little \nunique with our status as custodians, but I wanted to testify as neutral and express our \nappreciation to Clark County and for the bill itself.  Thank you so much. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any other testimony in neutral?  [There was none.]  I will close testimony in \nneutral on Assembly Bill 197.  I would invite our sponsor to make any closing remarks. \n \nAssemblyman Watts: \nThank you for your consideration of this.  As the others said in testifying and providing \nsupport, this bill can save lives.  It can build on a strong record and commitment from our  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 17, 2021 \nPage 32 \n \nstate  and  our  Legislature  to  remove  barriers  and  assist  homeless  people,  particularly \nhomeless youth, in getting back on their feet.  I appreciate all the suggestions that were made \nto help strengthen this bill.  I ask you all for your support. \n \n[Additional exhibits include an issue brief from Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth, \nExhibit U, and a letter in support from Young Adults in Charge, Exhibit V.] \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI will close the hearing on Assembly Bill 197.  At this time, I will open the hearing on \nAssembly Bill 96. \n \nAssembly  Bill  96:    Creates  the  Emergency  Response  Employees  Mental  Health \nCommission. (BDR 40-96) \n \nAssemblywoman Lesley E. Cohen, Assembly District No. 29: \nI am here to present Assembly Bill 96 for your consideration.  This bill came from my \ninterest in peer support for first responders.  I became interested in the issue because I heard \na radio news story about a successful program for peer support for first responders in another \nstate.  One of the people being interviewed mentioned how most of us run away from fire or \nbullets, but first responders run toward them.  When the people who run toward the fire \nor bullets are in crisis, it is often easier for them to open up to people who know what that is \nlike, what they go through in their daily jobs.  They need to open up and get support.  \nAccording  to  a  supplemental  research  bulletin  [\"Disaster  Technical  Assistance  Center \nSupplemental Research Bulletin, First Responders:  Behavioral Health Concerns, Emergency \nResponse, and Trauma,\" dated May 2018] from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health \nServices Administration of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, based on \nliterature and scientific publications from the National Center for Biotechnology Information, \nand U.S. National Library of Medicine, it is estimated that 30 percent of first responders \ndevelop  behavioral  health  conditions  including,  but  not  limited  to,  depression  and \nposttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as compared with 20 percent in the general population.  \nThe bulletin referred to a study about suicidality, noting that firefighters were reported to \nhave higher attempt and ideation rates than the general population.  Several national studies \nshow that more than twice as many firefighters die from suicide than in the line of duty.   \n \nAccording to a study by the Ruderman Family Foundation [\"The Ruderman White Paper on \nMental  Health  and  Suicide  of  First  Responders,\"  dated  April  2018]  both  police  and \nfirefighters are more likely to die by suicide than in the line of duty.  Moreover, that study \nnoted that the Firefighter Behavioral Health Alliance estimates that firefighter suicides are \nsubstantially underreported.  First responders are at risk for PTSD, depression, substance \nabuse, and suicide ideation and attempts.  Both natural and technological disasters were  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 17, 2021 \nPage 33 \n \nfound to be associated with the increased risk of these conditions.  A \"technological disaster\" \nis a catastrophic event that is caused by either human error in controlling technology or a \nmalfunction of a technology system.  Technology-based disasters are as serious as natural \ndisasters.  Examples include bridge collapses; dam failures; industrial, maritime, and aviation \naccidents; and more drawn-out events resulting from breakdowns in technology in which \nhighly toxic substances are used or stored.   \n \nOn top of that, emergency medical services (EMS) personnel are not immune to mental \nhealth issues.  According to the bulletin previously referenced, one of the core risk factors \nfor first responders is the pace of their work.  One study noted in the bulletin found that \n69 percent of EMS professionals have never had enough time to recover between traumatic \nevents.    This  results  in  depression,  stress,  PTSD,  suicide,  suicidal  ideation,  and  other \nfunctional and relational conditions being reported.  If anyone would like to see any of those \nreports or studies, I am happy to provide them. \n \nFirst  responders,  their  supporters,  and  mental  health  professionals  have  started  doing \nsomething.  I substantially amended A.B. 96 so that we can help first responders without \nspending funds we do not have [Exhibit W].  This legislation will not counteract any of the \ngood work done by first responder peer support groups but, hopefully, will be helping with \nthat.  Please refer to the conceptual amendment.  Before we go through it, I would like to \nthank our policy and legal staff and Margot Chappel, Deputy Administrator, Regulatory and \nPlanning Services, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, Department of Health and \nHuman Services, for working so hard to try to get this conceptual amendment done and come \nup with something that is going to be beneficial.  I am sorry for the delay in getting the \nconceptual amendment to you and the stakeholders.   \n \nThe conceptual amendment would remove sections 1 through 12.  It would add a section \nauthorizing a governmental entity that licenses and regulates first responders to enter into \ncontracts  with  nonprofit  organizations  to  carry  out  programs  to  provide  peer  support \ncounseling for first responders.  In those agreements, they will promote peer support for first \nresponders.  We are making sure that the nonprofit organization establishes and operates \na toll-free hotline for first responders to call if such persons are experiencing mental health \nissues as a result of the nature of their work.  The organization must establish and maintain \na network of peer support counselors to provide peer support counseling to those who call the \ntoll-free hotline.  The Division of Public and Behavioral Health would establish and maintain \non their website information on mental health issues associated with emergency response  \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 17, 2021 \nPage 34 \n \nwork, including, without limitation, stress, PTSD, addictive disorders, and self-medication, \nand information concerning local and national support groups for mental health services.  \nTo the extent that it is financially feasible, the Division will collect and report information \nrelating to suicide or suicide attempts for first responders to the Chief Medical Officer.  That \nis a data issue, to provide data about how first responders are doing in Nevada, so we can see \nif we are making improvements, where we need to be looking, and where we need to go.   \n \nMargot Chappel, Deputy Administrator, Regulatory and Planning Services, is here.  Her \noffice was extremely helpful in getting this bill to a place where there would be no fiscal note \nattached but we would still do some good for our first responders.  She can answer any \nquestions and provide information as needed.   \n \nMargot Chappel, Deputy Administrator, Regulatory and Planning Services, Division of \nPublic and Behavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services:  \nI am supportive of this language that we have now changed so that we can provide support \nthat is desperately needed without the funding.  There are agencies already doing this work; \nthis would lend them support and empower them to seek grants and contracts to support their \nexisting and future work. \n \nAssemblywoman Cohen: \nThank you.  With that, we are available for questions.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there questions on Assembly Bill 96? \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nIs this authorizing all the local entities to set up something like this?   \n \nMargot Chappel: \nIt is.  Of the first responders involved, the Division only licenses the EMS providers.  There \nare entities that certify, permit, and license police officers and firefighters.  This provides the \nflexibility to allow those other entities to do that work as well and engage in contracts to \nsupport the first responder support programs.   \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nIf those local governments have established relationships, this will not interfere with that.  \nIs it meant to complement anything already happening within a local entity already?   \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 17, 2021 \nPage 35 \n \nMargot Chappel: \nThat is exactly the intent—to support anything that is being done right now.  We know of \na program in southern Nevada, and I am aware of one called the Northern Nevada Peer \nSupport Network.  I believe there are a few agencies doing that.  This will allow them not \njust to exist, but to grow.   \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI appreciate this.  I know that we are lacking for money in this state.  We have national data \nthat tells us first responders are in crisis.  For two years running, the number one cause of \ndeath among peace officers was suicide.  Now we see a higher rate of suicide among our \nfirefighters.  This alarming trend is growing; we cannot turn a blind eye to it.  One thing we \nare  missing  is  Nevada-specific  data.    It  could  be  helpful  across  a  large  spectrum  of \nconversations.  We had a conversation last session about workers' compensation and PTSD.  \nI imagine that more conversations like that will arise as there is more public awareness about \nthe social impact these professions have.  I do not know if there is the willingness or the \nability, but we are missing Nevada-specific data which would be helpful as future legislators \nlook for Nevada data in order to form policy.  We are missing that, and we do not have \na repository for that type of data.  Is that something we could talk about more with the local \nentities?  It is that missing piece we need to figure out what is going on in our own backyard. \n \nAssemblywoman Cohen: \nIt is something I wanted to be able to capture because I had trouble finding data.  I think what \nwe are doing here is starting a conversation, opening the door so that when we are on better \nfinancial footing, we can come back and continue the conversation and get more done.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any other questions?  [There were none.]  We will go to testimony in support, \nopposition, and neutral of Assembly Bill 96.  Is there testimony in support of A.B. 96? \n \nAndrew LePeilbet, representing Military Order of the Purple Heart: \nI also represent the 70,000 disabled American veterans in the state of Nevada.  I am the \ncurrent chair of the United Veterans Legislative Council, which represents 250,000 veterans \nin our state.  When you count their families, we represent 500,000 Nevadans.  We are in \nsupport of A.B. 96, although we had a single question.  Considering that veterans, military, \nand their families represent around one-sixth of our population, we thought the commission \nbeing created should have a veteran mental health expert on the team.  Other than that, we \nare in support of A.B. 96. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 17, 2021 \nPage 36 \n \nDerek Reid, President, Northern Nevada Peer Support Network: \nWe represent law enforcement, firefighters, emergency medical services, dispatch, hospital \nprofessionals, ski patrol, and any service branch that has repetitive trauma exposure.  We \nhave  a  website  that  includes  the  list  of  numbers  mentioned.    I  have  spoken  with \nAssemblywoman Cohen.  We are in support of this in a collaborative effort to continue to \nprovide services.  We appreciate the support. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe can go to the next caller in support.  [There was no one.]  Are there any callers in \nopposition?  [There were none.]  Are there any callers in neutral?  [There were none.]  Are \nthere any closing remarks? \n \nAssemblywoman Cohen: \nI am glad Mr. Reid called in and appreciate the support.  I would recommend all members go \nto the Northern Nevada Peer Support Network website [nnpsn.com].  It is comprehensive.  \nHe and his organization have done phenomenal work in a short period of time.  It does not \ngroup all first responders together but breaks them apart for their special concerns and needs \nfor mental health care and peer support.    \n \nThis is not a big bill.  It does, however, accomplish important things such as data collection \nand getting information about peer support for first responders out there more.  It sets the \nscene for making sure we are doing as much as possible with peer support for first responders \nas this grows as a movement and as we financially recover as a state.  Thank you.  Anyone \non the Committee or anyone listening to the hearing can reach out to me with questions or \nsuggestions.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI will close the hearing on Assembly Bill 96.  At this time, we will begin public comment.   \n \nCyrus Hojjaty, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada:  \nI think we need to discuss the root problem of our health care system because you talk about \nhomelessness and mental health.  I think mental health is very important, especially among \nhomeless people.  I think that is why they are in the mess they are in today.  But we really \nneed to be talking about serious health care reform because I can tell you that a lot of \nprogressive media outlets are being betrayed by this current administration.  There is not \ngoing to be Medicare for All.   \n \nWe have to understand why U.S. health care has actually gotten worse.  It is because of the \npassage of the Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973.  When that law was passed, \nhealth care costs skyrocketed.  The issue is that Wall Street has been the largest beneficiary.  \nAmericans are suffering; Wall Street is benefiting.  It is pretty disgusting to see that our \nelected officials—both parties, at the federal level—are not even talking about this.  I think \nwe should have a discussion on Medicare for All.  We need to talk about whether this \nactually works.  I would, perhaps, be in favor of it if other taxes would be lowered.  I do not \nwant to have a big tax burden.   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 17, 2021 \nPage 37 \n \nI also would like to discuss ways to get Wall Street out of our health care system.  As you \nknow, they are not talking about this because Wall Street has an incredible amount of power \nover our health care system.  I want to know what you think.  What do you think should be \nhappening to that particular system and prescription drugs?  It has been skyrocketing, which \nis unacceptable.  What can be done about this?  This is out of touch.  Let us sit down and \ndiscuss this if you have the time. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nCan we go to our next caller in public comment?  [There was no one.]  Are there comments \nfrom members?  [There were none.]  This concludes our meeting.  Our next meeting will be \non March 19.

I have allocated equal time to testimony in support, opposition, \nand neutral after the bill introductions, and I will open the hearing on Assembly Bill 273. \n \nAssembly Bill 273:  Revises provisions relating to mental health consortia for children. \n(BDR 39-355) \n \nAssemblywoman Michelle Gorelow, Assembly District No. 35: \nAssembly Bill 273 would formally create a statewide mental health consortium for the \npurpose of unifying regional health consortiums and authorize additional powers for each \nconsortium.  During the 2001 Special Session, the Legislature approved Assembly Bill 1 of \nthe 17th Special Session which created three regional mental health consortiums designed to \nstudy the mental health needs of children in Nevada.  The provisions of the bill established a \nconsortium  for  Clark  County,  a  consortium  for  Washoe  County,  and  a  single  rural \nconsortium  to  preside  over  all  other  counties.    Pursuant  to  Nevada  Revised  Statutes \n(NRS) 433B.335, each consortium develops a long-term strategic plan to deal with children's \nemotional and mental health needs every ten years.   Each consortium is responsible for \nupdating their long-term plans and providing the director of the Department of Health and \nHuman  Services  with policy  priorities  biennially.    For  a  number  of  years,  an informal \nstatewide mental health consortium has existed to foster collaboration between the regional \nentities.  Assembly Bill 273 seeks to officially codify the organization in NRS for the \npurpose of dealing with an unprecedented crisis in youth mental health.  \n \nWe are all aware of the surge in mental illness brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.  \nOur children and young adult populations have been hit particularly hard with the closure of \nin-person education and widespread social isolation.  The startling number of teen suicides in \nthe state over the last year has tragically demonstrated the profound need to expand mental \nhealth services.  Nevada has an especially poor track record on this issue.  Mental Health \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 19, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nAmerica's  2021  statistic  ranks  Nevada  fifty-first  in  at-risk  youth.    In  other  words,  we \nproportionally have the highest rate of youth mental illness and the lowest rate of access to \ncare.  Now, A.B. 273 is not going to solve this crisis, but it will bring together important \nactors in the mental health arena to fill in health care gaps and present a unified effort to \ntackle our state's mental health epidemic. \n \nIf you go to section 2 of the bill, you will find the members who will make up the proposed \nstatewide consortium.  It includes policy officials representing the Division of Health Care \nFinancing and Policy and the Division of Child and Family Services, both in the Department \nof Health and Human Services; the Department of Education; regional consortium members; \nand the parents of emotionally unwell children.   \n \nSection 4 establishes the duty of the state consortium; namely, it authorizes the statewide \nconsortium to represent its member entities in an official capacity.  It also allows the state \nconsortium to evaluate the efficiency of treatments and proposed policy recommendations. \n \nSections 1, 3, and 5 of the bill specify that only regional mental health consortia are required \nto submit a long-term strategic plan and make necessary conforming changes.  Finally, \nsection  6  grants  each  consortium  the  ability  to  request  one  bill  draft  for  each  regular \nlegislative session, and section 7 places this update in NRS.   \n \nAssembly Bill 273 empowers our mental health consortiums throughout the state and gives \nthe tools to make corrective changes to the quality of care for mental illness.  I will now hand \nthe presentation to Dan Musgrove and Char Frost to make additional comments on the bill. \n \nDan Musgrove, Chair, Clark County Children's Mental Health Consortium: \nI have been before your Committee before when we briefed you on what the consortiums do.  \nIt  is  absolutely  crucial  that  we  as  regional  consortiums  have  the  chance  to  work  and \ncollaborate.  While many issues we have are unique to the different regions, there are so \nmany other issues we are in sync on.  It is always good to work together, especially when it \ncomes to advocating on behalf of the children in our state.  We kind of act as fiduciaries.  \nThe definition of a fiduciary is someone who acts in the best issues of others.  That is what \nhas been so great about the consortiums.  We have folks from the state, the county, the school \ndistrict, and parents.  We have a person like me who comes from the business industry.  We \nget together, take off the hats from the agencies we represent and focus on what is right for \nour kids. \n \nAs Assemblywoman Gorelow said, we have a crisis.  It is not new to those of us who have \nbeen working on the consortiums.  Former Speaker of the Assembly Barbara Buckley was \nahead of her time when she created the consortiums in 2001.  We want to make sure a state \nconsortium can exist by statute.  Until now, it has been an informal group.  In working with \nthe Division of Child and Family Services (DCFS) at the state level and others, they realized \nthe importance of the consortium, as we worked with them, and as they work on programs \nthat are in the best interests of kids.  It is important that it be put in statute to make sure that it \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 19, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nexists and also that the membership created in 2001 to bring together all the folks from \ndifferent entities exists at the statewide level. \n \nWe have been in consultation with Clark County, which plays a very important role in our \nregional Clark consortium.  As the bill specifies, each consortium will get the option of \nputting three members on the statewide consortium.  We are committing to Clark County to \nmake sure one of our three is a Clark County representative.  It is crucial that they have the \nopportunity to work across the state with people at the regional and state level and that will \nbe in our bylaws.  \n \nChar Frost, Chair, Clark Regional Behavioral Health Policy Board: \nI also have the privilege of serving as a parent representative on the Clark County Children's \nMental Health Consortium as well as the Chair of the Clark Regional Behavioral Health \nPolicy Board.  Dan Musgrove talked about collaboration.  Our policy board collaborates with \nthe Children's Mental Health Consortium because some of us sit on both and because the \nissues are so broad in mental health.  It is a great relationship to have someone who is \nfocusing on children, so I am here to support it. \n \nI also want to mention that, in the course of writing the language for this bill, not only did we \nwork with the state consortium but we also took the bill to each of the regional consortiums \nand they each unanimously supported the bill as you see it today.  We are very excited to be \nable to have these great relationships within the state and hope that the state consortium can \ncontinue doing the work it is already doing in a more formal, codified way. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo you have other presenters? \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nI do not.  We are ready for questions. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nHow did you decide on the type of membership for the consortium?  I am particularly \ninterested in the ex officio administrator or deputy administrator or designated representative.  \nAlso, how did you decide to specify the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy, \nbecause it appears they may also be represented on the regional consortia?  What was the \njustification there, and could you add any other information you think is supportive of the \ndecisions on these members? \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nI think Dan Musgrove would be the best person to answer that question. \n \nDan Musgrove: \nWe  wanted  to  make  sure  the  board  was  of  a  workable  size.    As  you  can  see  by  the \nmembership on the regional consortiums, there are a lot of folks represented.  We tried to \nmimic that for the statewide consortium—especially when it comes to representatives from \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 19, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nthe state, for instance, DCFS and Medicaid.  When we work together with the three regional \nconsortiums, it is important that they are hearing the information coming statewide.  We have \na person on the Clark consortium who comes from southern Nevada.  It is the same way with \nthe Washoe and regional consortiums.  They have representatives who work in those areas so \nthey  bring information from  those areas,  but when  we  have  someone  on the  statewide \nconsortium, we are speaking of someone who can look at the whole state and who is not \nregionally centric.   \n \nWe want to make sure that each consortium has a unique voice as their representative and we \nalso want to make sure parents are involved.  They experience firsthand what it is like to \nhave one of their children, or multiple children, affected by behavioral health issues. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nThat was helpful, but I still have a question about the ex officio and why the deputy \nadministrator is being designated versus just generalizing a representative. \n \nDan Musgrove: \nWe want to make sure it is someone who can attend the meetings.  Someone at the director \nlevel may not have the time.  For us, it is all about participation.  We want folks who are \ncommitted to this process, believe in our kids, and have the time to make the effort.  For most \nof us, this is all volunteer work.  This is work we do outside our regular jobs, and it is a huge \ntime commitment.  The Clark consortium has two meetings a month that usually last two or \nmore hours.  The statewide consortium meets either bimonthly or quarterly, and that is \nusually a two- or three-hour meeting.  That does not count all the work you do in preparation \nfor those subcommittee meetings.  This was done in consultation with those agencies as to \nwho they thought might be their best representatives to sit on the statewide consortium. \n \nChar Frost: \nWe  spent  a  lot  of  time  thinking  about  who  would  be  the  best  fit.    Referring  to  an \nadministrator, we really thought that by making it an ex officio, it gave them more latitude \nconcerning who to send.  For example, if the deputy administrator of DCFS cannot attend, he \ncan designate someone else.  We felt it gave latitude to DCFS while bearing in mind that they \ndo have a voting member from DCFS on that list as well.  For voting members, we wanted to \nbe sure there was some consistency. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nI want to be clear. Section 2, subsection 4, paragraph (a) states, \"The Administrator may \ndesignate a Deputy Administrator of the Division to attend any meeting . . . .\"  I do not read \nthat as \"or any other designee,\" so if the intention is to give them some latitude on ensuring \nsomeone is at the meeting at a minimum, we will review that and make sure that language \nmatches the intention. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 19, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank you, Assemblywoman Gorelow, for bringing this bill forward.  The mental health of \nall Nevadans is a huge issue.  I serve on one of the regional behavioral health care policy \nboards, and I am wondering if this is not a slight duplication of some of what these regional \nhealth care policy boards are doing.  Can you clarify that this is a unique position?  Is this a \nduplication?  Are we spreading our resources out when we need to be consolidating them so \nwe are all communicating?  What would this add to that, as opposed to duplication? \n \nDan Musgrove: \nIt would appear that way, but something we have done—especially at the Washoe and Clark \nregional policy board level and perhaps at the rural as well, but especially at the Clark—we \nhave designated the work on children's mental health to the consortiums.  We know they \nhave been working very hard for many years on these issues so the efforts are not duplicated.  \nEspecially in Clark and Washoe, we try to make sure there are representatives from the \nconsortia to sit on the regional policy boards as well.  There is me, Char Frost, and Jackie \nHarris—all three of us serve in both capacities so we have the ability to focus on both adult \nissues and also bring in the work the consortiums do to make sure the regional policy boards \nare not operating in a vacuum.  They hear those issues, we are advocates on both, and we do \nnot think there is a duplication.  Everyone is working in their separate spheres of influence \nbut then coming together and bringing that information together. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nYou mention serving on a couple of these—the consortiums and the board—which brought \nup another question.  I have constituents who have wanted to serve on more than one board.  \nI guess the consortium is not a Governor-appointed board, so one can serve on more than one \nboard.  Currently, in statute, you can only serve on one appointed board at a time.  Is this \nconsortium not considered to be that?  Is this not a conflict?  I got a legal opinion from our \nstaff concerning another appointment I was trying to make, but the person was already \nserving on a board and could not serve on more than one board at a time.  Do the consortiums \nnot fall under that? \n \n \nDan Musgrove: \nThe way the consortium is set up, it goes through the Administrator of DCFS, so DCFS has \nto approve every nomination that comes from the board.  That administrator is the one who \nmakes the official designation.  For the regional policy boards, a number of those positions \nare appointed by different folks.  The Governor gets a couple, the Legislature gets a couple, \nbut I have to yield to legal counsel for that interpretation.  \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI would not have thought anything of it except that I tried to appoint this person who is on \nour behavioral health policy board to another board.  As you know, we have difficulty getting \npeople to volunteer, so people who are already engaged, great, but we were told we could \nnot.  There is a bill to fix that which the Nevada Association of Counties (NACO) is bringing \nforward because we have run into this before—people who are trained, people who are \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 19, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nvolunteering, people who want to serve are limited.  The answer might be that this is a \nconsortium not appointed by the Governor.  If our legal counsel is available, we might get \nsome clarity on this. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI do believe there is a bill being brought by NACO.  We have had some of the same problems \non several interim committees I served on.  I would encourage Assemblywoman Gorelow \nand the rest of your team to contact the Legal Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau at \nthe conclusion of this hearing to see if we can get some clarification. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nAs  someone  who  worked  on  getting  appointments  and  reappointments  to  the  regional \nbehavioral health policy board, it became hard to fill some of those spots because they were \nso specifically written.  To echo what Mr. Musgrove said, there is a dedicated corps of \npeople who work in this field.  In section 2, there appear to be nine members.  Are you going \nto inadvertently be making it more onerous for certain categories of people?  There seem to \nbe a total of six members coming from the regional consortiums onto the statewide consortia \nboard, three from the local consortiums and three parents of children.  Depending on how \nfrequently they are meeting, I want to be sure you are not inadvertently building a structure \nwhere, for the majority of your board—six members—this might be the third meeting they \nhave in a month.  If it becomes too much in terms of attendance, you do not want to end up \nwhere you do not have a quorum.  That is just food for thought. \n \nThere is one item I want to get fleshed out in the legislative record.  Section 4, subsection 2, \nparagraph (b), talks about one of the board duties being recommendations and approving \nplans that could prevent placement of children.  What is the intent of the word \"approve\"? \n \nDan Musgrove: \nThat question was also brought up to us by Clark County.  It falls under that discussion I had \nabout being a fiduciary.  There is no doubt that we are very strong and passionate advocates \nwhen it comes to children, and there are times when we might disagree with the direction an \nagency might be taking.  It will not be a blanket approval.  As we advocate on behalf of these \nchildren, we bring priorities from all three consortiums to the Legislature to make sure that as \nyou begin a session, you are aware of those priorities.  Sometimes they do not always fall in \nsync with what the state has already approved.  It is an opportunity for us to be a part of \ndecision-making and make sure they understand where the consortiums are coming from.  \nThat is what we saw as our approval.  It does not mean we necessarily will approve it; it \nmeans we will take the opportunity to give them a pretty solid recommendation and that we \nwill be passionate in our advocacy as to whatever our recommendation might have been—\nwhether it is in sync with that agency or not. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI appreciate that.  The role of a dissenting voice on public policy is very important.  We know \nthere is a lot of work that needs to be done, especially in this area.  I am wondering, and we \nmight want to get clarification from legal, if we, as a Legislature approve the statute with the \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 19, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nword \"approve\" in there, how that might be interpreted.  When there is a board with three \nmembers from state government—Medicaid, Education, and DCFS—if there is a dissenting \nvote where those three folks might vote to support a state measure because they are agents of \nthe state, and then there are six votes that do not support the measure, then the board \nrepresentation would be \"No.\"  How much weight would that \"No\" carry in terms of whether \na policy would go through the state?  I wonder if the word \"recommendation\" alone covers \nthat?  I would not want the unintended consequence to be that, if the board voted something \ndown, it would prevent the state from taking an action versus having a record that you were \nin opposition to that action.  Do you understand what I mean? \n \nDan Musgrove: \nThat is an excellent point.  I would have to review the statute, but I think we are advisory \nonly; however, that is a very good question to ask legal.  You are right.  We certainly should \nnot  be  in  the  position  of  delaying  any  important  state  program  that  has  already  been \napproved, for instance, by this Legislature.  I know you are not giving us that much authority. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nIf you got the authority, you would not give it away and neither would I.  That is why I think, \nMadam Chair, we should make sure we have the intent right or the word right so we do not \ninadvertently set ourselves up with something more problematic.  We do not want to have to \ncome back and strike that section out. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe are taking notes, and I am sure Assemblywoman Gorelow will follow up with legal to \nmake sure there are no unintended consequences.  Seeing no other questions from Committee \nmembers, we will begin testimony in support, opposition, and neutral on A.B. 273.  We will \nbegin with support testimony on A.B. 273.  [There was no one.]  Are there any callers in \nopposition to A.B. 273?  [There were none.]  Do we have any callers in neutral?  [There were \nnone.]  At this time, I will turn this back to Assemblywoman Gorelow.  Do you have any \nclosing remarks? \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nAn official statewide mental consortium is long overdue.  It is time to unify the regional \nbodies and empower them to effect change.  I want to thank Dan Musgrove and Char Frost \nfor being here today and testifying.  I look forward to working with the Committee and legal \nand looking at some of the changes that need to be made. \n \n[Exhibit C was submitted but not discussed and will become part of the record.] \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI will now close the hearing on A. B. 273 and open the hearing on Assembly Bill 283. \n \nAssembly Bill 283:  Requires certain retail establishments to allow persons with certain \nmedical conditions access to employee restrooms. (BDR 40-128) \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 19, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nAssemblywoman Michelle Gorelow, Assembly District No. 35: \nAssembly  Bill  283  requires  certain  retail  establishments  to  provide  restroom  access  to \npersons with digestive conditions and subjects bad actors to civil penalties.  I will forewarn \nthe  Committee  that  parts  of  the  bill  are  in  the  process  of  being  workshopped  with \nstakeholders.   \n \nI received a phone call from a constituent who brought this problem to my attention.  In \n2005, a 15-year-old girl named Ally was denied access to a retailer's employees' bathroom \nduring a Crohn's disease flare-up.  The retailer's refusal to accommodate Ally's medical \nemergency led to an accident in the middle of the store.  After that, Ally and her mother \nlobbied an Illinois state representative to introduce a restroom-access bill that has become \nknown as Ally's Law.  The Illinois State Legislature unanimously passed Ally's Law, which \nis the same in intent and nearly identical in form to the bill before you today.  Ally is not \nalone in dealing with the struggles of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.  The Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention estimates that more than three million Americans have an \ninflammatory bowel disease (IBD) condition.  The Ulcerative Colitis Association projects \nthat as many as 700,000 Americans receive a IBD diagnosis annually.  Folks with these \nconditions deserve peace of mind.  They deserve to know that a bathroom is never too far out \nof reach when an attack occurs. \n \nThe bulk of A.B. 283 is contained within section 1 of the bill.  Section 1, subsection 1, \nestablishes four conditions under which retailers with an employee bathroom must provide \naccess to eligible persons during regular business hours.  First, the customer must provide \nproof in writing of their condition.  This includes a copied statement signed by the customer's \nhealth care professional attesting to their condition or an identification card issued by a \nhealth-related nonprofit.  Second, three or more employees must be present and working at \nthe time of the request.  Third, the retailer does not have a public restroom, and fourth, access \nto the retailer's bathroom must be reasonably safe or not pose a security risk to the retailer. \n \nSection 1, subsection 2, states the civil liability for retailers that deny or approve bathroom \naccess.  As per the bill, retailers are exempt from liability if they are not willfully negligent, \nrestroom access occurs in an area not accessible to the public, or the customer gets injured.  \nCurrently, we are in discussion with stakeholders on both sides of this issue to amend the \nliability provisions in subsection 2; but it does not embolden businesses to deny access, but at \nthe same time, does not leave them without reasonable protections. \n \nSection 1, subsection 3 of the bill establishes a civil penalty of not more than $100 for an \nemployee or retailer that violates subsection 1.  Finally, section 1, subsection 4, defines \nterms.  The two most significant definitions as they relate to the scope of the bill are \"eligible \nmedical condition\" and \"retail establishment.\"  \"Eligible medical condition\" would include \nCrohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable and inflammatory bowel disorders, and conditions \nrequiring the use of an ostomy device or any other permanent or temporary medical condition \nthat necessitates bathroom access, for example, pregnancy. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 19, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nAs it stands, the definition of \"retail establishment\" is broad and includes any business place \noffering a good or service; however, we are working with chambers of commerce and the \nRetail Association of Nevada to refine the scope of qualifying retail establishments.  The \nspirit of A.B. 283 is to guarantee bathroom  access to people with medical disabilities; \nfundamentally, it is about dignity.  People with Crohn's disease should not have to plan out \ntheir lives based on the nearest public restroom.  I will now turn this over to Alex Cimo and \nJennifer Campbell. \n \nAlex Cimo, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \n[Alex Cimo submitted written testimony Exhibit D in support of A.B. 283.]  I want you to \nreflect  on  a  time  in  your  life  where  you  felt  especially  vulnerable—maybe  the  most \nvulnerable.  When you reflect back on that, how did you feel in that moment?  Did you feel \nhelpless?  Alone?  Embarrassed?  Mortified, even?  What about defeated?  If you continue to \nreflect back on that memory, ask yourself, is there anything I could have done to change that \noutcome?  As someone who has suffered from ulcerative colitis for the past ten years, this is \none of many questions I and many others who suffer from inflammatory bowel diseases \nconstantly ask ourselves as we live our lives on a daily basis.  Where is the closest restroom?  \nDoes this business have a restroom?  What is the quickest way for me to get to the restroom \nin case I suddenly feel the urge to use it?  What if I am driving and have to make an abrupt \nstop to relieve myself?  Will the businesses in the area of town I am driving through even \nhave public restroom access?  What if I am presenting testimony to the Nevada Legislature \nand suddenly have to excuse myself?  These are all things that run through our minds on a \ndaily basis, and our lives are conformed around that mentality.   \n \nFor those of you who may be unfamiliar with either ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease, \nthese are two disorders classified under the umbrella term of inflammatory bowel disease, or \nIBD.  Inflammatory bowel diseases are disorders that involve chronic inflammation of the \ndigestive tract, resulting in symptoms such as chronic diarrhea, fatigue, abdominal pain and \ncramping, and most salient to this testimony, uncontrollable bowel movements.  Depending \non the severity of the condition, these bowel movements can occur anywhere from six to \nsixteen times per day, sometimes even more.  What would you do if you were in a part of \ntown that has limited public restroom access?  We have all been in that situation.  We hold it.  \nYou would either wait until you get home and use the restroom in your house, or you would \nwait until you got into an area of town that does have easy access to a public restroom.  Well, \npeople with ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease cannot hold it, and if we can, it is only for a \nvery short period of time.  The physical stress is already severe enough, but the mental stress \nis another battle entirely.  Our disease dictates our life decisions, and the amount of dates, \nfamily gatherings, and life celebrations I have had to miss out on as a result of my ulcerative \ncolitis is unfathomable because in the back of my mind, there is always that lingering \nquestion, what if there is not access to a restroom?   \n \nOne time I was with a friend at a record store and felt the urge to use the restroom.  This \nrecord  store  was  located  within  a  part  of  town  that  had  very  limited  access  to  public \nrestrooms, and the signs displayed all throughout the store made it abundantly clear that \nI would need to seek a restroom elsewhere.  This record store was located in a strip mall with \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 19, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nseveral other small businesses, and as I squirmed from one business to the next trying my \nbest  to  remain  calm,  each  one  had  signage  in  their  front  windows  saying,  \"No  Public \nRestroom.\"  I was panicking:  Am I going to make it?  Soon enough the inevitable happened, \nand I soiled myself in public.  I eventually made my way over to a fast food restaurant that \nwas  across  a  major  public  road,  and  was  granted  access  to  their  restroom  to  begin  \ncleaning up.  Fortunately, I was out with a friend, and after notifying him about what had \nhappened, I had him retrieve a backpack that I always keep in my car packed with cleaning \nwipes, a fresh change of clothes, and a note that says \"everything will be okay\" to help me \nremember that this, too, shall pass.   \n \nOne of the inadvertent side effects of ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease is that you cannot \nphysically see our condition.  You cannot see what we are going through, what we are \nstruggling  with.    Did  you  know  that  over  three  million  Americans  suffer  from  either \nulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease?  That is over 1 percent of the population.  If you are \nasking yourself why this is the first time you are hearing about this, it is because it is \nembarrassing.  It is simple.  No one wants to talk about all the times they have to use the \nrestroom in a day.  No one wants to talk about the times they have soiled themselves in \npublic.   \n \nImagine you were me ten years ago when I first started having symptoms of ulcerative \ncolitis.  This was when I was in high school.  Imagine what it is like for children, for \nteenagers growing up to have to go to school enduring what we have to go through for \nanyone who has an irritable bowel disease. \n \nThis did not have to happen to me, nor did it have to happen to Ally Bain, the young woman \nfrom Illinois for whom Ally’s Law is named.  I walked past a total of seven other businesses \nthat had restrooms available, but they were not publicly accessible. The signs alone deterred \nme from even wanting to ask, regardless of my condition.  To a business owner, I am just \nanother person trying to use the restroom, when they are completely unaware of what I and \nthe millions of other Americans who might be suffering from these diseases are actually \ngoing through.  At this very moment I carry an Urgent Medical Notice card from the Crohn’s \n& Colitis Foundation of America—a nonprofit—hoping that in emergency situations I will \nbe able to quickly obtain access to a public restroom when it may not be easy to do so.  This \ncard does not have any legal backing, it is more for peace of mind.  Just carrying it, I know \nI might be skewing probability more in my favor and I might have access to a restroom when \nI might not otherwise. \n \nI want to quickly acknowledge that there have been a handful of understanding business \nowners who have allowed me to use their nonpublic restrooms in my time of need, and I am \ngrateful for each and every one of them as they help me narrowly avoid another embarrassing \nsituation.    The  adoption  of  Ally's  Law  would  provide  me,  as  well  as  hundreds  if  not \nthousands of Nevadans, the tools to allow us to live more freely without fear.  If you recall \nthe beginning of my testimony, I had you ask yourselves, is there anything I could have done \nto change the outcome of a time where you felt especially vulnerable, helpless, alone, or \nembarrassed?  Today, you all have the power to help change the outcome for Nevadans \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 19, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nsuffering from these incurable inflammatory bowel diseases and can help us provide a better \nway of life. \n  \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you for your testimony and sharing your personal experiences here today.  It has had \nquite an impact.  Assemblywoman Gorelow, do you have anyone else here today? \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nYes,  Jennifer  Campbell  is  here  from  the  Nevada  Chapter  of  the  Crohn's  &  Colitis \nFoundation. \n \nJennifer Campbell, Executive Director, Nevada Chapter, Crohn's & Colitis Foundation \nof America: \nThank you for your time and consideration of this important issue.  I would also like to thank \nMr. Cimo for his testimony.  He is not alone in his experience.  He summed up anything \nI could have said in further support.  There are approximately 31,000 Nevadans who suffer \nfrom Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.  As Mr. Cimo mentioned, there is no cure for this \ndisease.  It is something a patient will live with for the rest of his or her life.  \n \nAs Mr. Cimo mentioned, IBD causes many patients to worry about whether or not they will \nhave access to a restroom when they are in public, and it absolutely changes how they are \nable to go about their daily lives.  When our pandemic began about a year ago and we were \nall asked to stay at home, I was speaking to a patient who is one of our support group leaders.  \nShe said, \"Oh, heck.  I have been training for this for the last 15 years.  Once I was diagnosed \nwith Crohn's disease, I do not like leaving my house because I never know when I am going \nto need access to a restroom and I will not have it.\" \n \nIt is something our patients need to deal with every day.  The card Mr. Cimo mentioned, we \ncall it the \"I can't wait\" card.  They are cards we make available to Crohn's or ulcerative \ncolitis patients in an effort to empower them, to give them a tool so they can say that they \nhave a disease and need help right away.  To many establishments' credit, that sometimes is \nenough, but sometimes it is not.  Without that card and with those signs in the windows, it \ncan feel really defeating for a patient to not have an opportunity to use the facility if they \nneed to.  We at the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation are in full support of A.B. 283.  Hopefully, \nwe can seek a time where patients have increased access to restrooms.  Thank you for your \ntime and consideration of this bill.  We ask that you will move the bill out of Committee. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there other presenters? \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nNo, that should be our last presenter.  We are available for questions. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 19, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nAssemblyman Matthews: \nThank you, Assemblywoman Gorelow for presenting the bill and thank you also, Mr. Cimo \nand  Ms.  Campbell,  for  your  testimony.    I  would  like  to  clarify  the  definition  of \n\"customers\"—those who are in the retail establishment as customers either to purchase \nsomething or for other purposes, or would this apply to those who would be coming into the \nestablishment solely for the purpose of using the restroom?  Based on the testimony, it \nsounds like the intent is the latter, but I would like it clarified. \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nYes, the intent is that anyone coming into an establishment who may need to use a bathroom \ndoes not need to buy a stick of gum to do so.   \n \nAssemblyman Matthews: \nIt would then be unlawful, for example, for a business owner to make purchasing something \na condition of using the restroom, that would be the intent. \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nYes, that is the intent—anyone who may need to use the bathroom.  As Mr. Cimo stated, he \nwas going down a strip mall continually finding that he could not use any of the restrooms, \nso the intent is that someone could come in, use that card, and use the bathroom. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank you, Assemblywoman Gorelow, for bringing the bill and also the testimony for the \nneed.  I have seen hundreds if not thousands of folks with irritable bowel disease and \ndiagnosed them with ulcerative colitis, et cetera, and treated them.  I understand that sense of \nurgency, but the need, that urgency to use a restroom, is far greater than that scope of disease.  \nWhy did you just focus on that?  Folks who may have urge incontinence, men who have \nprostate cancer and have surgery may become incontinent and when they feel they have to \nuse a restroom, they need to immediately use one.  Women on bladder medications or those \nwho have had children may not have good bladder control.  Are there any other states that \nexpand the definition?  Is there only one state that has passed this specifically for ulcerative \ncolitis?  Is there no one representing those with bladder issues? \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nCurrently, 16 states have Ally's Law on the books.  We used a lot of their verbiage.  They all \nstuck mostly with ulcerative colitis; however, we are open to expanding and have discussed \nother medical conditions.  We know there are a lot more people with cancer and other \ndiseases who could also fall under this.  We are open to expanding to other conditions as \nwell. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nYour intent is good; however, I have concerns about the unintended consequences of bills \nsuch as this.  I am thinking about the poor little clerk in the store whose boss has said, you \ncannot let people in here to use our restroom.  In section 1, subsection 3, it reads, \"A retail \nestablishment or an employee\" who does not let somebody use the restroom can be fined.  \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 19, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nHow do you propose to educate?  What would the cost be?  I see there is no cost to a county \nor the state listed, but how do you propose educating Nevada businesses, especially the small \nbusinesses?  That is who this is going to affect.  The large businesses, the shopping malls \nhave restrooms, but it is the small businesses, the little mom-and-pop shop, the little tire \nstore, that little dress shop that does not allow people to use their restroom.  How are you \ngoing to educate them if this is passed?  Who will be responsible for that?  Will it be the \nbusiness license department of our Secretary of State?  How can this be held without some \nsort of cost? \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nIn the instance you mentioned where there is one employee at the store and the boss has said \nno one can use the restroom, that person would not be required by this legislation to allow \nbathroom access because there would only be one employee.  There have to be three or more \nemployees, and that is also for store security.  If there were three or more employees and they \ndid not allow access, it would be up to the consumer to make a complaint.   \n \nConcerning education, that is something we are looking into.  It might be business license \npeople saying, here are the changes.  The retail association might help us with the education \nas well; I agree that there needs to be an education component so they understand who can \nuse the bathroom and under what conditions. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank you for that because I have significant concerns that we pass laws and now we are \ngoing to fine somebody, but they do not have a clue what it is all about.   \n \nMy next question concerns the cards.  Will you go to your provider to get a card?  Will the \nprovider have to provide it or how will that process work?  I know you already have those \ncards, but does everyone belong to that foundation?  I have patients who do not share this \ninformation with everyone and do not necessarily belong to that foundation. \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nThe Crohn's & Colitis Foundation has those cards and Jennifer Campbell will explain more \nabout the process.  In many other states, a quick letter from a doctor stating that there is a \nmedical condition has been sufficient. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nWe already have health laws and we already have state regulations, especially for restaurants.  \nDoes this change that?  Does it preempt existing rules and regulations? \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nI will have to talk to legal counsel about that.  I do not anticipate that this would.  Most \nrestaurants have bathrooms; however, we are working with the Retail Association of Nevada \nconcerning smaller ones that might just be take-out locations.  In our discussions, pizza \nplaces were discussed, as many are small, mostly take-out locations and we are working with \nthem on possibly carving out exemptions for some of the smaller ones.  In some other states, \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 19, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nthey exempted restaurants based on size.  I do not have a concept of what square footage \nlooks like, so I do not think that is the route we will go, but we are working with them so we \ncan come to a compromise.  \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there other questions from Committee members before I take testimony in support, \nopposition, and neutral? \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nI want the copresenter to know I am grateful that you shared your story.  When I was \npregnant I had a couple of embarrassing morning sickness all-day-long scenarios where I had \nto go home and change.  I had to bail on my business meeting, or my client dinner, or my day \njob to take care of myself.  Things just change, and not everybody has the ability to make it \nto a restroom every time something comes on.  I applaud you for sharing your story and \nnormalizing the differences in our bodies.  Thank you for bringing the bill. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there other questions or comments?  Seeing none, we will take testimony in support, \nopposition, and neutral on A.B. 283.  We will begin with testimony in support of A.B. 283.  \n[There was none.]  Do we have any callers in opposition to the bill? \n \nLeonard Stone, representing Nevada Justice Association: \nI am uncomfortable being in the category of opposition because in most ways, we are very \nsupportive  and  applaud  the  compassionate  efforts  of  this  bill  to  protect  a  vulnerable \npopulation suffering from these life-altering medical conditions.  We heard some excellent \ncomments about the probable need to broaden the definitions of those medical conditions.  \nI appreciated for example a moment ago the discussion about how pregnancy can lead to \nsenses of urgency.  That is one thing to consider. \n \nWe have no opposition to section 1, subsection 1, because we think this is generally a good \nbill, but we strongly oppose subsection 2 which provides immunity to businesses unless they \nare willfully or grossly negligent.  The reason we oppose this portion of the bill is it lowers \nthe standard of care for this vulnerable population.  The law is quite clear regarding a \nlandowner's or lessee's obligations relative to the safety of land.  Do not be negligent.  Be \nreasonable, provide reasonably safe space.  Basic negligence, in other words, reasonable \nconduct  does  not  necessitate  willful  or  grossly  negligent  conduct  in  order  to  be  held \naccountable.  We should not be sending a message and we certainly should not be passing a \nlaw that tells businesses they can relax on safety.  Presumably, they already care about their \nemployees  who  are  using  the  space.    Business  owners  and  operators  already  have  an \nobligation to maintain safe space.  They should be equally, if not more, concerned about \nthese  vulnerable  individuals.    By  raising  the  standard  to  willful  and  grossly  negligent \nconduct, we are not adequately incentivizing these businesses to keep people safe. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 19, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nOn the one hand, this is a great bill.  We should be protecting people.  On the other hand, in \nexchange for that, for this obligation we should have, which is compassion and empathy, it \nshould not be in exchange for changing the standard of care and allowing spaces to be less \nsafe. \n \nBryan Wachter, Senior Vice President, Retail Association of Nevada: \nI appreciate Assemblywoman Gorelow bringing the bill forward and for working with us.  \nWe are in opposition to the bill as it is currently written, but we hope we will be able to get to \na place where that will not be true any longer.  We are ready and able to provide some \nnotification to retailers in the state, but we might consider allowing the first instance to be a \nwarning so that business has adequate notice going forward.  We, of course, would oppose \nany changes to section 1, subsection 2. \n \nAmber  Stidham,  Vice  President,  Government  Affairs,  Henderson  Chamber  of \nCommerce: \nI, too, thank Assemblywoman Gorelow for reaching out to our organization on this bill.  We \nare  committed  to  working  together  with  the  Assemblywoman  to  address  some  of  our \nconcerns and finding a way that we can work this out.  However, today, as the bill is written, \nwe are opposed. \n \nPaul J. Moradkhan, Senior Vice President, Government Affairs, Vegas Chamber: \nI want to thank the bill's sponsor for meeting with the Vegas Chamber about the bill.  Those \nconversations were productive.  We understand the policy need at hand and are sympathetic \nto the issue.  Our concerns with the bill are some technical components as we have shared \nwith the bill's sponsor.  For example, the broadness of the retail definition as it relates to our \nmembers because of some security and public health care concerns for certain industry \nsectors within Nevada's business communities.  As we shared with the bill's sponsor, we \nbelieve there needs to be an exemption for certain groups, such as banks, credit unions, \nfinancial institutions, and they would not be included in the \"retail\" definition because of \nsecurity concerns.  We also have a concern for some of our smaller business restaurants that \ndo not have a public-access bathroom and the customer would have to go through a food \npreparation area which would be in violation or an issue with local health district standards.  \nWe appreciate the bill's sponsor helping develop a solution to address those two sectors. \n \nWe would have a concern about changes to section 1, subsection 2.  We believe if we are \nmandated to open up back-of-the-house facility restrooms that we should not lose protection \nfor that for the public to come through those areas.  We will continue to work with the bill's \nsponsor, and it is our hope to quickly find a resolution to this bill.  Again, we are sympathetic \nto the policy issue at hand. \n \nAlexandria Dazlich, Director, Government Affairs, Nevada Restaurant Association: \nWe are here today in opposition to A.B. 283 as it is currently written.  A critical component \nof the restaurant industry is strong food safety practices.  With this in mind, the Nevada \nRestaurant Association, as well as our local health districts, is concerned about the health and \nsanitation consequences this bill will open up.  Some restaurants would be placed in the \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 19, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nmiddle of deciding between receiving a fine from the health district versus receiving a fine \nfor not opening their bathroom.  By allowing nonemployees back-of-the-house access where \nfood is stored, prepared, and cooked, it quickly becomes a sanitation hazard that would have \na potential impact on the health of its customers in addition to the safety of restaurant \nemployees.  By allowing patrons uninhibited access to areas like back of the house, kitchens, \nand food prep and storage areas, employees are also now susceptible to potential violence \nand harm from bad actors who take advantage of this privilege.  It is for these reasons we are \nhere today in opposition to the bill as it is currently written.  We look forward to continuing \nto work with the sponsor and going forward and finding a resolution. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there other callers in opposition?  [There were none.]  Are there any callers in neutral?  \n[There were none.]  At this time, I will turn this back over to Assemblywoman Gorelow for \nany closing remarks. \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nAssembly Bill 283 is about dignity and making sure people are able to use the restroom when \nthey have certain medical conditions.  I want to thank Mr. Cimo and Ms. Campbell for \njoining us today and sharing their stories.  And I want to thank everyone who called in in \nopposition.  We have reached out to them and we are going to continue working.  Hopefully, \nwe can come to a mutual agreement on some of the language with this bill.  It is our intent to \nallow people the dignity of going to the bathroom. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nSeveral people have submitted written letters in support of A.B. 283 [Exhibit E, Exhibit F, \nExhibit G, Exhibit H, Exhibit I, and Exhibit J].  I encourage you to check on NELIS [Nevada \nElectronic Legislative Information System] for those letters.  I would remind any members of \nthe public if you want to comment on either bill presented today, you have 48 hours in which \nto submit written support, letters, or documentation, and I would encourage you to do so.  \nI will now close the hearing on A.B. 283 and begin public comment.  Is there anyone for \npublic comment?   \n       \nGerri North, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \nI am submitting testimony in support of a study to determine ways retired state workers who \ndo not qualify for Medicare can access affordable health care and medication.  I am a \nresident of Assembly District 12.  I have been retired from the Clark County School District \nsince 2008 as a full-time teacher, and I was a guest teacher from 2010 until 2020.  I am a \nmember of the Nevada State Education Association-Retired (NSEA-R) and the Clark Retired \nEducation Association.  As a retiree on a fixed income, I know rising health care costs are a \ncontinuous worry for many Americans.  Many Nevada educators and other state workers who \nare eligible to retire continue to work because they have no access to Medicare, having never \npaid into Social Security.  As you can imagine, having no insurance increases their anxiety \nand contributes to depression.  \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 19, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nMany retired educators I have spoken with use smaller doses of maintenance meds, with or \nwithout doctor input, to make ends meet.  They also put off procedures and surgeries.  \nWorkers who dedicate three or four decades to the state of Nevada deserve better.  Please \nkeep in mind active and retired state workers need access to affordable health care when they \nretire.  Members of NSEA-R appreciate anything you can do to help contain the cost of \nhealth care and medicine.  We hope you will consider a study to determine the status of state \nworkers and steps that could be taken next session to ensure all Nevada workers have access \nto affordable health care and medicine in their golden years. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you for your public comment.  Do we have any other callers on the line for public \ncomment?  [There were none.]  At this time, I will close public comment.  Do we have any \ncomments from Committee members before we adjourn?  [There were none.]  Our next \nmeeting will be on Monday, March 22, 2021, at 1:30 p.m.  We are adjourned [at 1:51 p.m.].      \n       \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nTerry Horgan \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nAssemblywoman Rochelle T.

Grant General Hospital \nRichard Karpel, Executive Director, Nevada Press Association; and Member, Nevada \nOpen Government Coalition \nJustin Watkins, representing Nevada Justice Association \n \nChair Nguyen: \n[Roll was taken.  The Chair reminded Committee members, witnesses, and members of the \naudience of Committee rules, protocol, and procedures for virtual meeting.] \n \nI will now open the hearing on Assembly Bill 44.  Today we have with us Mason Van \nHouweling, CEO of University Medical Center, and I will turn it over to you. \n \nAssembly Bill 44:  Revises provisions relating to county hospitals. (BDR 40-401) \n \nMason Van Houweling, Chief Executive Officer, University Medical Center: \nAs many of you are aware, University Medical Center (UMC) is one of the busiest hospitals \nin southern Nevada.  Situated in the urban core, located in the heart of the Las Vegas medical \ndistrict, the hospital serves as southern Nevada's safety net for residents and visitors alike.  \nUniversity Medical Center provides a number of services that are home and \"one-of-a-kind\" \nhere at UMC, including the Level I Trauma Center, the Lions Burn Care Center, the Center \nfor Transplantation, Children's Hospital of Nevada at UMC, and a Level II Pediatric Trauma \nCenter. \n \nUniversity Medical Center retains more than 4,000 employees and cares for hundreds of \nthousands  of  visitors  and  patients  each  year.    In  addition,  UMC  is  affiliated  with  the \nUniversity of Nevada, Las Vegas School of Medicine in the creation and pursuit of a career \nacademic health center.  Over the last year, UMC has played an integral role in the state of \nNevada's COVID-19 response.  Being the state's leader in COVID-19 testing, we have \nperformed well over a million PCR [polymerase chain reaction] tests with result turnaround \ntimes of less than 12 hours.  Now we have moved on to the next chapter in the COVID-19 \nvaccination efforts.  As of right now, we have done 41,400 vaccinations to date. \n \nWe are here to discuss Assembly Bill 44, a bill that is sponsored by Clark County and \nsupports the mission of UMC to provide the highest level of care to our patients while \nensuring exceptional quality and meeting our goal of being good taxpayer stewards of the \ntaxpayer dollars.  This bill serves two purposes.  It codifies in Nevada Revised Statutes \n(NRS) our UMC governing board.  The governing board was created by Clark County \nordinance in 2013.  The governing board members are appointed by the Clark County \nCommission,  which  remains  as  UMC's  hospital  board  of  trustees  and  UMC's  ultimate \nauthority.  In 2013, the commissioners had the foresight to recognize the importance of \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 22, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nhaving dedicated members of the community with specialized knowledge and skill sets to \nprovide oversight and guidance with respect to daily management of hospital operations.  As \nI know and members of this Committee understand, health care law and regulations are very \ncomplex and always evolving.   \n \nThe second purpose of A.B. 44 is meant to address the complex, unique issues the hospital \nfaces in health care—issues around the regulatory environment.  University Medical Center \nwould like the ability to have frank and open conversations and dialogue with our board \nleaders, whether with the governing board or the actual board of hospital trustees.  In fact, \nour licensing and regulatory and accreditation standards require us to ensure both of our \nboards are fully informed when making very difficult decisions.  Whether it is the ability to \nhave these private deliberations under other Nevada law, those procedures and those statutes \ncan sometimes conflict.  Furthermore, it can lead to delays informing our board earlier than \nwe would like where there are proactive measures that can serve to improve the quality and \ncare as we have discussed. \n \nTo be clear, this bill does not allow for the governing board of any public hospital to take \naction or make decisions in a closed session.  We have heard from various stakeholders since \nour bill was introduced.  Throughout these discussions with our stakeholders, we understand \nthat the original language in the bill early on was perhaps a little too broad.  It did not clearly \naddress those narrow instances where closed sessions and deliberations are needed.  The \namendment  before  you  today  is  narrowly  tailored  to  meet  our  needs  [Exhibit  C].  \nFurthermore, we understand that the Nevada Rural Hospital Partners is seeking to introduce \nan amendment that will extend these opportunities to rural county hospitals as well so they \ncan better address patient safety and quality concerns.  We support our rural partners and \ntheir amendment as we believe that this bill would ensure that public hospitals across Nevada \nwill have the same ability as private hospitals to address federal and state regulations aimed \nat providing safe and quality patient care. \n \nThis bill will also serve as a safeguard to the Nevada taxpayers, an investment in their own \npublic hospital by allowing a public hospital's governing board to proactively address any \npotential legal or regulatory issue.  Adverse outcomes, costly fines, or protracted litigation \ncan be avoided.  This bill is not against transparency.  University Medical Center's governing \nboard will always be transparent in the decision-making process.  This merely addresses the \nability to deliberate and have discussions with our board members.  All votes on matters will \noccur in open session in accordance with all existing requirements.   \n \nWe want to stress that we have been working with various stakeholders to address the \nconcerns with this bill and we will continue to do so.  We are more than willing to listen and \nwork with everyone to find a suitable compromise for a final bill. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThere  are  two  amendments  on  the  Nevada  Electronic  Legislative  Information  System \n(NELIS).  Both amendments on NELIS are friendly, is that correct? \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 22, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nMason Van Houweling: \nYes, that is correct. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nCommittee members, I did have staff email those amendments to you this morning, and they \nare both on NELIS.  We have a lot of questions, and we will start with Assemblywoman \nThomas. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nDoes this mean that UMC becomes a private/public entity? \n \nMason Van Houweling: \nNo, that is not correct.  We celebrated 90 years of serving our community this year and will \ncontinue  for  the  next  90  years  as  a  public  institution  operating  for  the  Clark  County \ncommunity. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nIn reading this bill, the board of hospital trustees, which would be the county commissioners, \nwould still be the hospital board of governors' bosses.  Am I correct? \n \nMason Van Houweling: \nCorrect.  That is not changing, it is codifying.  Back in 2013, Clark County established \nUMC's governing board.  The hospital board of trustees are the Clark County commissioners \nwhen it comes to hospital business; they are serving as hospital trustees.  They have oversight \nof the UMC governing board, which are those community members.  We meet monthly but \nthere  are  four  subcommittees  under  that  board:    finance,  quality,  strategy,  and  human \nresources.    They  meet  often  throughout  the  month  and  serve  as  the  overall  operating \noversight at the hospital.  Those governing board members report to the hospital trustees who \nare our Clark County commissioners.  This would be codifying it in the NRS, which are \nalready in the Clark County Code of Ordinances. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nHow does this affect the union? \n \nMason Van Houweling: \nThere is no direct or indirect impact to the union.  As I mentioned, any deliberations, votes, \nor decision-making always would occur in the public session.  We have great attendance at \nour meetings with the union.  I meet with them frequently, and our team meets with them \nfrequently.  I cannot see any direct or indirect impact to our union partners here at UMC.  \nThey  are  always  welcome  to  our  meetings  and  they  frequently  attend  governing  board \nmeetings, the subcommittees, but also, if there is a need, hospital trustees' business matters \nthat go in front of Clark County commissioners.  They are often there supporting or making \ntheir voices heard.  Usually, I am there with them side by side. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 22, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nMy concern was the fact that the governing board would be tasked to make bylaws, changes, \nand things of that nature, and I was wondering how that would affect the union at UMC. \n \nMason Van Houweling: \nThose would always be handled at the county commission level, again wearing their hospital \ntrustee hats.  They are very good at switching from Clark County Commission business to \nhospital business.  There would be no changes to bylaws that would come out of a closed \nsession within UMC.  All those decisions, any votes, are always done in the public eye, \nproperly noticed, vetted out, and discussions made—nothing that I would see that would \ndirectly impact the union with this particular bill. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nIn your presentation you mentioned that A.B. 44 would prevent litigation.  How is that \npossible? \n \nMason Van Houweling: \nIt would not prevent litigation, but it would perhaps minimize protracted litigation.  It would \nallow us to inform our board of any potential regulatory litigation issues sooner than later to \nbe  able  to  address  those  matters.    Again,  everything  would  be  properly  done,  done \nthroughout the process in an open decision, but it would allow us to be more proactive on \nlitigation matters and also in protecting our patients and our employees. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nIt  is  my  understanding  that  there  are  already  some  protections  for  closed  meetings, \ndiscussions in certain cases and scenarios.  Can you talk about those and the difference this \nbill will make to those scenarios and why this is particularly needed if we already have some \nprotections for other specific scenarios. \n \nMason Van Houweling: \nI may lean on our general counsel for this one.  There are instances when we have been going \ninto closed session, particularly concerning litigation matters, but I would prefer that our \ngeneral counsel, Ms. Pitz, answer that question. \n \nSusan Pitz, General Counsel, University Medical Center: \nYes, there are other areas and other statutes where you can go into closed session; for \nexample, to talk about the competency and conduct of practitioners.  There, you would \nfollow the procedure under that statute.  Here, we are trying to put that ability under NRS \nChapter 450, which is specific to running a hospital, so that we can follow our specific \nprocedures related to that.  The medical board has done similar in NRS Chapter 630 where \nthey make references to this and following their procedure, as has state's mental health and \nthe Commission on Behavioral Health's statute under NRS Chapter 433. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nBy running the hospital, can you give us a couple of examples of where this is important? \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 22, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nSusan Pitz: \nPart of why we made the amendment to specifically reference review committees under NRS \nChapter 49 is practitioners reviewing practitioners—peer review.  When you are doing peer \nreview in a hospital setting with physicians, it is important that the peers review each other.  \nThe hearing, the witnesses, the testimony, all get done with a panel of their peers.  It is that \nsetting when I see us using this the most—being able to do that hearing, call witnesses, and \ntake testimony at the peer level.  Then when it gets up to the governing board level, they are \njust reviewing the record and not providing a full new hearing. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nThat peer review practice does not have confidential components that are already protected \nunder statute? \n \nSusan Pitz: \nYes, it absolutely does have confidential and privileged information.  That is in the review \ncommittee statute in NRS Chapter 49, but that is not going to evolve at that level.  It is not \ninvolving any public official employment. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nI  am  having  a  hard  time  tracking  where  this  particular  piece  comes  into  play  in  the \nimportance for the hospital.  Could you narrow that down for me?  What is missing right \nnow?  What do you not have?  Maybe I am not understanding, but I need a little more \ndiscussion about that. \n \nSusan Pitz: \nUsing that example of peer review and practitioner review, it has long been recognized in \nNevada law that to get physicians to participate in peer review, to look at the role of other \nphysicians in instances where maybe they did not do the best or there was an adverse \noutcome, they review each other at that level.  It is at the hospital that was actually involving \nour medical staff, which is an independent entity though it is under UMC.  It is a group of \nphysicians who are elected who meet and discuss these issues.  What happens with all \nhospitals is you have this peer review at the medical-staff level and the fair hearing panel of \nthe peers.  But the ultimate decision, according to health care laws and regulations, needs to \nbe approved, so the medical staff or the fair hearing panel may make a recommendation, for \nexample, that privileges are revoked.  In every instance in hospitals, it has to go up to the \nboard to approve that recommendation.  Here, our board happens to be a public board, so if \nthe public board had questions about the record that might include that sensitive information \nthat was at the peer review, they would be doing that in open meeting or they would be going \nunder NRS Chapter 241.  While we have done that in the past and continue to do that, it does \nnot follow the same procedure we would like to do under NRS Chapter 450.  That is the \nmissing piece we are looking to solve here. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nThank you, that makes sense.  So there is a very narrow place where this would affect how \nyou are able to run the review of issues within the hospital.  Looking at your amendment, it \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 22, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nsays to discuss \"Matters . . . including, without limitation, deliberations of the character, \nalleged misconduct, professional competence, or physical or mental health of a provider of \nhealth care.\"  So that is the scenario you are talking about, the peer review piece.   \n \nSusan Pitz: \nCorrect. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nAnd then the second is, \"Reports related to the compliance of the hospital with all laws, \nregulations, rulemaking guidance of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or with \nany conditions of participation in the Medicare or Medicaid program.\"  Can you describe a \nscenario in which that is applicable? \n \nSusan Pitz: \nAs a hospital, we are licensed and accredited by a number of different bodies both on the \nstate  and  federal  level.    The  Centers  for  Medicare  and  Medicaid  Services  (CMS)  has \noversight over the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  Obviously at UMC, we take Medicare \nand Medicaid.  To be able to take Medicare and Medicaid, you have to follow certain rules of \nCMS in their conditions of participation.  They expect, and part of those conditions of \nparticipation is, that you have a fully informed board, that you are bringing any issues to \nthem that you are policing yourself, much like in the peer-review setting in which physicians \nare tasked with policing themselves.  In a hospital that is a CMS provider, you are expected \nto police yourself and report those issues to a fully informed board.  That is what we are \nlooking to address.  In this amendment, we tried to narrow that and we will continue to try to \nnarrow that.  That is what we are trying to accomplish. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nI appreciate your entertaining these questions and talking about the specific scenarios, but I \nmay have more questions as we go along. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nMy question concerns the amendment.  As I read section 1, subsection 5, any conversations \nand supporting records and transcripts for those closed meetings will be outside that five-year \nrule in which it has to become public so they will indefinitely remain not public records.  Is \nthat right? \n \nMason Van Houweling: \nCorrect.    Those  would  become  public  after  five  years  unless  they  are  privileged  and \nconfidential.  You have read that correctly. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI worry about the need for this.  In other statutes, even information that is held outside of \npublic record, even some of the most sensitive records indeed do become public after about \n30 years or so.  Could you talk about why you would need perpetual protection around this \ninformation? \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 22, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nSusan Pitz: \nBecause five years was already in NRS Chapter 450 related to the other closed sessions that \nwe have; we kept that.  So actually, it is saying that we will turn it over, that it would be open \nto public record after five years unless it is privileged, which is how existing law is now—if \nit is privileged once, it is privileged for all time.   In instances where it is not privileged, like \nsome of those issues I was speaking about with Assemblywoman Peters, CMS-type issues, \nthose would not necessarily hold a privilege and would be subject to disclosure after five \nyears. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI see you are keeping the five years in there whenever you use NRS 49.117 or 49.265 in the \nway you use it now.  However, if your board deems that you need to have that perpetual \nprotection, then it will fall outside that five years.  Am I misunderstanding that, or is it really \njust five years for everything? \n \nSusan Pitz: \nYes, I believe it is meant to be and we can certainly look at the language if it is not clear on \nits face.  It is meant to be that everything is subject to being open in five years unless it holds \na privilege.  Those review committees under NRS Chapter 49 would hold that privilege, but \nanything else would not necessarily hold that privilege, so it would be open.  We are not \nlooking to keep that perpetually protected. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI know you are referencing some of the CMS conditions of participation.  For the legislative \nrecord I would feel more comfortable if you could get to us what specific pieces of CMS data \ncollection you are concerned about.  So much of that is aggregate data.  I cannot think of a \ntime when you are really getting into protected health information at the aggregate level once \nyou start collecting data.  You might have more of those conversations at a different level, \nbut I think I need help with what you specifically mean—whether it is sentinel events—and \nthen some examples where you have run into problems with the data collection piece, \nsatisfying CMS, and the inability to provide information because of a sensitivity to public \nhealth records.  That would help it be more concrete for me as I am trying to understand this.  \nI have additional questions about section 2, but I will hold onto them and let the conversation \ncontinue. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nHaving  been  on  the  Nevada  State  Board  of  Medical  Examiners,  on  the  peer  review \ncommittee when it was in existence for the entire state, and having served as chief of staff for \na hospital, I have been involved in lots of peer review cases.  They are not bad, they are not \ngood, they are something that has to happen in standard of care.  For clarification, charts get \npeer-reviewed that fall into certain categories; for instance, if you transfer a patient out of the \nemergency room within 24 hours, if someone dies in a certain stay, if someone leaves AMA \n[against medical advice], all those are subject to peer review by standard.  It does not mean \nthat there is anything good or bad, it is just that they fall into a category where they would \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 22, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nbe reviewed.  Frequently I would look at those, determine they had met standard of care, \nend of story. \n \nThis law, NRS 450.140, already exists.  It already reads that the board of trustees has this \nability, but what you are adding here is the language \"or any hospital governing board\" \nbecause it is different between county hospitals, rural hospitals, and private hospitals.  Is this \nadding a clarification on covering for all hospitals and not just those with a board of hospital \ntrustees? \n \nSusan Pitz: \nYes, the language you are reading is a clarification that a board of hospital trustees can go \ninto closed session and so can its appointed and delegated governing board.  We are trying to \nmake a clarification there with that language. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThat is in section 1, subsection 3.  Looking at section 2, subsection 1, what we are adding \nhere are counties because many counties do not have hospital trustees.  \"In counties in which \nthe board of hospital trustees appoints a hospital governing board . . . ,\" which is a different \nstructure.  It is clarifying that they may also be \"exercising powers and duties delegated to the \ngoverning board . . . .\"  There are different ways of organizing hospital structure.  The way \nI am looking at this bill, it clarifies that all those levels of structure would be included in \nbeing able to have that peer review in certain situations already afforded in general language.  \nIs that how I am reading this? \n \nSusan Pitz: \nAbsolutely.  If you look at the language in section 2 that talks about NRS 450.175, it states \nthat \"In counties in which the board of hospital trustees appoints a hospital governing board, \nthe governing board is the governing body of the county hospital when exercising powers \nand duties delegated to the governing board pursuant to this chapter.\"  What that is saying is \nthat whoever is the delegated authority and whichever structure you are under, when they are \ntaking action, they have the authority to take the action.  Throughout the NRS it uses the term \n\"governing body,\" so at times that can be confusing—whether or not you are talking about \nthe board of hospital trustees, the governing board, either one.  Whoever has the authority to \ntake that action is the governing body for that matter. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI see this as clarifying language to statutes that already exist under the many different \nconditions of hospitals.  We have to allow those who do conduct peer review to do their jobs, \nwhich, as the opening statement said, will help for patients' overall outcomes and patient \nprotection.  Thank you for bringing the bill forward.      \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWhat do \"privileged\" and \"confidential\" mean within the context of this statute?  Is that \nsimilar language you are trying to capture that applies to other hospital facilities right now? \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 22, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nSusan Pitz: \nIn the amended language at section 1, subsection 3, paragraph (c), we specifically called up \nNRS Chapter 49 because various stakeholders asked us to narrow the bill and get to what we \nwere really trying to address.  In NRS Chapter 49, those references, that is \"confidential and \nprivileged\" conversations and materials that are used in those peer review settings.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIt appears to me that the board gets to determine what is \"privileged.\"  Am I reading that \nincorrectly or is that how the process takes place? \n \nSusan Pitz: \nI do not believe the board determines what is privileged.  If it is part of a review committee \nproceeding that fits under NRS Chapter 49, it is privileged.  Unless, of course, like any \nprivilege, it is somehow waived. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nUnder current law, it does not allow for privileged information to avoid this disclosure after \nfive years.  Is that correct? \n \nSusan Pitz: \nYes,  that  is  correct.    We  wanted  to  because  existing  law  in  NRS  has  that  five-year \nrequirement if we went into closed session.  It would be available for me to request that \ninformation and supporting materials.  We wanted to make clear that it would apply here, but \nif something is privileged, it is still going to maintain that privilege.  We did not want it to be \nread as a waiver of any privilege after a certain period of time. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nSo the board determines that it is privileged, then they can waive that five years? \n \nSusan Pitz: \nIt was intended to be the opposite, but as we talked about earlier, if that needs to be clarified, \nwe certainly could.  The privilege is there and after five years, anything that does not hold the \nprivilege is subject to request for disclosure. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI would also appreciate clarifying language on that area. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nThe original language talked about health care facilities and spoke specifically of peer review \nand then it was crossed out.  I am a little concerned about that.  Now, it just references \n\"provider of health care.\"  In my opinion, that seems broader, more expansive, and still not \nclear.  Who would be considered to be providers of health care? \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 22, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nSusan Pitz: \nThe statute specifically points to a defined term of \"health care provider\" which is licensed \nproviders.  Our intent with that was to narrow it to those instances of peer review of those \npractitioners.  There was concern we heard from various stakeholders that talking about the \nfacility and some of the more general information might catch up other areas of law, such as \nOSHA requirements, for the facility.  The intent in that language was to narrow it to licensed \nprofessionals, licensed providers, peer review. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nIn looking at NRS 49.117, it is talking about committees of the hospital, the ambulatory \nsurgical center, and all that.  \"Peer\" would be the people working for those organizations that \nare providing the service, is that correct?  That could include anyone working inside those \nfacilities, is that right? \n \nSusan Pitz: \nWhat would be in the review committee could involve other people, I suppose.  The review \ncommittee the hospital is using in this instance is for its licensed professionals.  If your \nconcern is that it not include something specifically, perhaps we could look at making it clear \nthat it excludes certain things related to the facility.  We use the review committee privilege \nfor our peer review of licensed professionals, and that is why the reference is there. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nThe  committee  deciding  what  things  are  privileged  is  a  concern  of  mine.    I  am  also \nconcerned about a statement you made earlier about policing yourselves and the need for this \nto be confidential in some manner.  Often, that has not worked for the general public, when \ninformation is not available to the general public to at least know that there could be issues in \na particular area of government.  This is all being paid for by taxpayer dollars.  Even though \nUMC is providing services, it is still a part of the community.  We own it because we pay \ntaxes and we contribute in our communities for that hospital to run, not fully, but we have a \nstake in what happens at UMC.  Self-policing is very concerning to me, especially when we \ntalk about the people who are on these committees, who are already public servants.  They \nare elected officials and I think there is an expectation that some of what goes on would \nalready be open to the community.  I am concerned about adding another layer of what could \nbe perceived as secrecy to a review panel, especially when you already have a tool to protect \npeople's identities.  I cannot get clarity on the necessity for this additional ability to meet in \nsecret.  If you have other information you could share, I would appreciate that very much to \nhelp clarify for me.  This is my first time hearing anything about UMC and how you want to \ndo this. \n \nSusan Pitz: \nWhen I use the term \"self-policing,\" that is the term CMS uses.  They require all hospitals, \npublic or private, to engage in these types of activities, and that is what I was referring to. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 22, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there other questions from Committee members?  [There were none.]  At this time, I will \nstart testimony in support, opposition, and neutral on A.B. 44.  We will begin with testimony \nin support of A.B. 44.   \n \nJoan Hall, President, Nevada Rural Hospital Partners: \nThank you for allowing me this friendly amendment [Exhibit D].  Do you want to go over \nthat now, or just my testimony in support of this bill? \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe are doing support testimony now.  I know Committee members have had the opportunity \nto review your amendment. \n \nJoan Hall: \nNevada Rural Hospital Partners (NRHP) is a consortium of 13 critical access hospitals, 7 of \nwhich are county district hospitals.  They are all in support of this process.  The National \nQuality Improvement Act of 1987 laid out the foundation for peer review, recognizing that \nphysicians were the best reviewers of physicians.  That is why they put this process in place.  \nThey also recognized that doing this confidentially and in a safe manner was very important.  \nSo nationally, that standard has already been set.  \n \nWe appreciate this verbiage going into NRS Chapter 450.  It is already in law in NRS \nChapter 49, but putting it in NRS Chapter 450 makes it clearer for both the district hospitals \nand the county hospitals, and the public we serve.  We are very much in support of this. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIs there anyone else in support? \n \nHugh Qualls, Administrator, Mt. Grant General Hospital: \nI would like to express my support for A.B. 44 and echo what Joan Hall from NRHP \nexpressed, and add a rural, but in Mt. Grant's case, a frontier concern.  There are two major \nissues I wish the Assembly to be aware of.  In any hospital, especially a small one like ours, \nthat level of candor from peer to peer that exists in peer review is critical to getting specific \ninformation about any provider care that did not meet the standard of care.  If that were to be \ndisclosed to the public, in my experience, you do not have much candor or specificity that is \nrequired for continuous improvement.  We are all concerned about patient outcomes and if \nwe cannot have candid conversations, it will be difficult to have the improvements necessary \nto provide the best care possible for our patients. \n \nThe second issue involves being in a very small town like Hawthorne.  It does not take very \nmuch for people to put two and two together.  If this became public knowledge or was \ndisclosed, no matter what level of discretion we exercise, people will soon know the exact \npatient being talked about and who the provider was, as well.  It does not take much to \nconnect the dots, so that is a concern.  And my recommendation for keeping this as private as \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 22, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \npossible in order to improve the quality of care and to provide some PHI [protected health \ninformation] protection for our patients. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any more callers in support?  [There were none.]  Can we go next to our callers in \nopposition to A.B. 44. \n \nRichard Karpel, Executive Director, Nevada Press Association, and Member, Nevada \nOpen Government Coalition: \nWe oppose the sections of A.B. 44 that close meetings and make public records confidential \nand we do not think the amendment that was submitted helps.  My understanding is that there \nare other members of our coalition who are in communication with the bill proponents and \nthat we will be meeting with them to work through our issues.  Based on what we already \nknow, it is not clear why A.B. 44 or even the stuff that is already closed in the underlying \nstatute, it is not clear why any of it needs to be secret.   \n \nFor instance, why should residents of the state not be allowed to participate in meetings \nwhere  the  compliance  of  their  local  public  hospital  with  federal  laws  is  going  to  be \ndiscussed?  What could possibly be more important to the public than whether their local \nhospital is complying with federal law? \n \nIf I am understanding the peer reviews correctly, they should already be covered by the Open \nMeeting Law which allows public bodies to discuss personnel matters in closed session.  The \nproponents appear to be conflating privileged and confidential information, but they are \nactually two different things.  We are opposed to A.B. 44. \n \nJustin Watkins, representing Nevada Justice Association: \nOn behalf of the Nevada Justice Association, we are opposed to A.B. 44.  The intent stated in \nthis hearing does not mesh with the language of the bill nor do the policies align with the \nlanguage of the bill. \n \nThe reason why peer review committees and their deliberations are not disclosed for five \nyears is so there can be honesty among peers and not retribution among peers and have an \nhonest review.  That policy does not comport with the bosses of the company or the hospital \nreviewing the conduct of its employees.  So there can be no fear of reprisal from the \nemployees against the governing body and therefore, there is no need to have secrecy or lack \nof transparency in this regard.  Further, the stated timelines of the secrecy, the five years, \nnow get extended indefinitely under the language of this bill if the committee determines that \nthe information is privileged.  In existing law, it must be disclosed after five years; now, \nthere would be no disclosure. \n \nWhat this means is that people who have been wronged by the hospital will be unlikely to \nfind out any relevant information as to why they were wronged, who was responsible for the \nwrong, as the five years far exceeds the statute of limitations for bringing a claim, and the \npeople of the state of Nevada will not be able to hold their elected officials accountable for \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 22, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nbeing good or bad stewards of their tax dollars and administering the governance of the \nhospital.  For those reasons, there is a lack of accountability in this bill, there is a lack of need \nfor this language in its entirety, and it certainly is against public policy to increase the level \nof secrecy among government-funded hospitals. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nMay we go to our next caller in opposition to A.B. 44.  [There was no one.]  Do we have any \ncallers in neutral on A.B. 44?  [There were none.]  I will turn this back over to Mr. Van \nHouweling to make any closing remarks. \n \nMason Van Houweling: \nWe want to continue to work to refine the bill as needed.  We will be reaching out to those \nwho  had  additional  questions.    There  are  two  things:    codifying  the  board  in  NRS  is \nimportant  to  Clark  County  and  also  narrowing  down  the  bill  to  make  sure  we  have \ndiscussions and dialogue, but always we will do things in open session.  Any actions and any \nvotes will always be done in open session. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThere  were  a  couple  of  follow-up  questions.    Previously,  Assemblywoman  Benitez-\nThompson had some questions about section 2 and I do not believe they were answered.  \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI think section 2 is much more the meat and potatoes of what you are trying to get at.  The \ncounties do not get very many bills, so this must be important.  I do not know what the \ndistinction would be between the practice right now where UMC has a governing board and \nthe powers and duties it is using without it being specifically stated in statute, or that \nsomeone has given the opinion that it is not specifically stated in statute and then putting the \nprovisions of section 2 into place.  How would things change from how they are operating \ntoday versus how they would operate after the effective date of this bill? \n \nMason Van Houweling: \nIt is clarifying.  Since 2013, this has been a Clark County ordinance.  As you heard reference \nto NRS Chapter 450, codifying that and clarifying whether it is a governing board, governing \nbody, the authority would be clarified in section 2.  Again, the hospital trustees here in Clark \nCounty  are  elected  officials.    They  appoint  governing  board  members  to  oversee  the \ngoverning board and also the subcommittees.  As Joan Hall mentioned, this would help other \ndistrict hospitals, other public hospitals, clarifying the language on the authority and putting \nit in the right section of NRS Chapter 450. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI appreciate that.  So there is nothing else I need to hold in my head to give consideration to \nthis.  As you see section 2, it is a cleanup.  There are no other conversations going on.  I am \nfrom northern Nevada and not from Clark County, so I do not know if there are other \nconsiderations I should be holding in my head.   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 22, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nMason Van Houweling: \nIt is an important piece, but it is just codifying and bringing clarity with no other intent \naround that—just make it in NRS Chapter 450, which defines all the hospitals here in the \nstate as previously mentioned. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nTying back to section 1, subsection 3 in the amended version, you use the word \"any.\"  It \nsays, \"the board of hospital trustees or any hospital governing board,\" but the intent is \"the\" \nhospital governing board.  You cannot imagine a scenario in which there would be multiple \ngoverning boards, you mean it as the one and only appointed governing board that would \nhold that authority.  There is not a plan for additional governing boards to hold additional \nauthority. \n \nMason Van Houweling: \nYou are correct.  There is no other intent, certainly not here in southern Nevada.  I am not \nspeaking for Joan Hall, because the structure could be different in a district hospital versus a \npublic hospital—county hospital—but there is no other intent.  You have the trustees and the \ngoverning board here and that is how we see it for the future ahead. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDoes anyone have any follow-up questions?  [There were none.]  At this time, I will close the \nhearing on A.B. 44.  Thank you for your presentation.  We will move to public comment.  Do \nwe have any callers on the line for public comment?

At this time, I will open the hearing on \nAssembly Bill 256. \n \n Assembly Bill 256:  Provides for Medicaid coverage of doula services. (BDR 38-849) \n \nAssemblywoman Shondra Summers-Armstrong, Assembly District No. 6: \nToday, I am presenting Assembly Bill 256, which would enable Medicaid coverage for \nnonmedical doula services.  I would like to start this presentation by sharing a personal story.  \nIn 1987 I found out I was pregnant with my first child.  I was living with my first husband in \nVisbek, West Germany.  We were stationed at an Air Force forward operating location.  The \nnearest military hospital was more than two hours away in Bremerhaven.  Because of the \ndistance, I was given the option to have my baby at a local German hospital.  I did not know \nit at the time, but part of the continuum of care included a midwife.  Her name was Geisela \nBusse.  She was a stout, dark-haired, no-nonsense woman who spoke very little English.  \nAlthough she had a firm demeanor, Frau Busse exuded kindness and competence, just what \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 24, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nthis first-time mom needed to get through pregnancy and delivery while living over 5,000 \nmiles from my mom, who would not be able to attend the birth. \n \nOur first meeting was at my house with my landlord's wife as an interpreter.  Frau Busse \nasked lots of questions and made suggestions on room temperature, baby bed, and how much \ntime to put the baby in the window each day to get sunlight.  In the weeks before delivery, \nI attended Lamaze and La Leche League classes at her home.  She was my rock throughout \nthe birthing process.  Epidurals were not common practice there.  Frau Busse got me through \nthe birth process with breathing, concentration, touch, and encouragement.  She visited me \nevery day in the hospital after I gave birth.  I am telling you this story to illustrate the \ndifference it can make when a mom has support before, during, and after delivery.   \n \nCurrent best practice is to have a nonmedical doula providing support solely for the mom \nwhile the midwife or physician delivers and cares for the baby.  I was lucky to have had an \nextremely skilled midwife who was able to attend me in the delivery room.  If there had been \nany complications, her attention would have shifted, and rightfully so, to the baby and away \nfrom me.  The goal of this bill is to ensure that both mom and baby have the individualized \nsupport  they  need  throughout  the  entire  birth  process.    At  this  time,  I  will  hand  the \npresentation over to Quentin Savwoir so he can explain how and why his organization is \nengaged in advocating for this bill. \n \nQuentin Savwoir, Deputy Director, Make It Work Nevada: \nWe work alongside Black women and Black families to build power for economic, racial, \nand reproductive justice.  Part of the mission of our organization is to advocate for the health \nand vitality of our community members.  Assembly Bill 256 is anchored in that intention. \n \nWe are facing a national maternal health crisis in this country, as the United States is the \nmost dangerous place in the developed world for an expectant parent to give birth.  The \nreality is even more grim for Black women who die at a disproportionately higher rate than \ntheir counterparts.  For every 100,000 live births, 43 Black women die.  When I first heard \nthis statistic, it devastated me.  It devastated me because I could not help but think of all the \nnew babies born into this world who would not have their mothers.  I was overcome with \ngrief,  wondering  how  many  new  Nevadans  would  not  immediately  know  the  fierce \nprotection, unconditional love, and comforting warmth of their mama.   \n \nIt did not take long for us to find out that the national trends we are facing as a country are \nparticularly present here in Nevada.  We conducted field research in a series of focus groups \nin order to best understand the health needs of our community members.  Our Black women's \nagenda survey, a survey of more than 1,000 Black women in Nevada, discovered that more \nthan one-fifth of our respondents reported maternal health as their most preeminent and \npressing issue.  We also found that one-fifth of respondents reported feeling like they had no \ncontrol over their bodies or the decisions associated with their bodies.   \n \nIn the series of focus groups we hosted, we were able to dig a little deeper.  It was in these \nconversations that we learned the troubling reality that postpartum has on parents.  The \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 24, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nwomen and birth parents we spoke to talked about being stressed, fatigued, and experienced \nissues with breastfeeding amongst other hardships that a nonmedical doula would be capable \nof  supporting  a  parent  through.    In  these  same  conversations,  nearly  one-third  of  our \nparticipants reported not having access to prenatal care or prenatal services at all.  Finally, \nthese conversations with our community members revealed that doulas would be the most \nhelpful resource during pregnancy, alongside parenting classes and resources to help with \npostpartum depression. \n \nOur research and conversations culminated in the pursuit of this legislation.  Expanding \nMedicaid to provide for doula services to expectant parents and mothers is the best way to \nhelp mitigate subpar birth outcomes, ensuring new Nevada children are getting a healthy and \nthriving start, and serve as a cost-saving measure for our state.  Assembly Bill 256 is \ncommunity-driven policy that, at its core, is about our Nevada children.  What kind of \nNevada do we want to see them born into?  Hopefully, it is one where we see the value in \ntheir life before they even arrive.  Hopefully, it is one where we ensure that the mother or \nbirth parent has access to any and all the resources that can not only ensure a safe and healthy \nhome birth, but also ensure a postpartum period that is met with support and ease, instead of \ntrauma and stress.  We can do something about this, and we should. \n \nAlexandra Gunter, Doula, Reno Doula Project: \nThe Reno Doula Project was started in 2012 as a way to help mothers gain access to doulas.  \nHistorically, having a doula was a thing of privilege reserved for the upper class.  Through \nthe Reno Doula Project, we have been able to close this gap and increase access to doulas by \nreducing the cost through an income-based sliding scale, ensuring that women of all income \nlevels are able to hire doulas. \n \nThere is no doubt that doulas provide a necessary service.  Women who have doulas attend \ntheir births have lower rates of unnecessary interventions during their labors and higher rates \nof birthing satisfaction.  More importantly, births attended by doulas have fewer neonatal \nintensive care unit admissions, higher rates of breastfeeding initiation, and a longer duration \nof breastfeeding.  In Nevada, only 21 percent of our infants are still exclusively nursing at six \nmonths, when breast milk can be both lifesaving and cost-saving for Nevada families.  We \nneed to do anything we can to support that.   \n \nIn addition to the Reno Doula Project, I am also the director of postpartum services at \nanother doula company, Bright Heart Birth Services.  Bright Heart has worked tirelessly to \nmake the role of doula a legitimate role within this field.  We are not medical professionals, \nbut we are professionals.  Careful attention to scope of practice, continued training, and \ncommitment to our clients before, during, and after labor has paved a path for doulas to be \nwell-regarded within my community.  I am so happy to testify in support of more doulas at \nmore births. \n \nThis past year, the Reno Doula Project has had the honor of accepting a sponsorship from \nAnthem Medicaid to provide 50 of their members with doulas starting in 2021.  Anthem has \nput their money where their mouth is, both in terms of considering doula support as a \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 24, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \ncost-saving  measure  and  enriching  service  to  their  members.    This  sponsorship  is  an \nopportunity to further legitimize doulas within the field of perinatal support.  People are \nwatching us because they know what we are capable of.  I thank you for your time today and \nask for your support on this bill to include doula services as a Medicaid-covered benefit. \n \nLauren Kalogridis, Program Manager, Thrive Wellness of Reno: \nI am a doula with Reno Doula Project, Bright Heart Birth, and the Anthem Medicaid project, \nas well as a perinatal psychotherapist and program manager at Thrive Wellness of Reno \nwhich has the only perinatal intensive mental health patient program in Nevada.  I will share \nwith you some statistics that back up some of what folks are speaking to in the narrative form \n[Exhibit C].  Of the 36,000 births that happen in Nevada annually, about one-third are \nperformed by cesarean and about 10 percent are preterm births [page 2]—both of which have \ndisproportionate numbers of Black women reflected in those demographics.  As far as the \nmaternal mortality crisis Quentin Savwoir referenced, Nevada is one of 48 states within the \nUnited States that over the last 20 years has seen a 27 percent increase in our maternal \nmortality rates.  In Nevada in 2018, 76 percent of the deaths were people covered by \nMedicaid.  Black and Native American women have significantly higher maternal mortality \nrates than white women.  In national averages, there is a two- to five-times higher chance for \na Black or Native American woman to die due to pregnancy-related causes than a white \nwoman.  In Nevada, Black women have been shown to be dying at rates twice as high as \nwhite women.  In Nevada, our infant mortality rates increased 6 percent between 2016 and \n2018.  Again, this is a place where we see a racial disparity in that Black babies are twice as \nlikely to die as white babies nationally [page 3].   \n \nBirths represent a significant cost expenditure here.  In Nevada, 61 percent of births are \ncovered by Medicaid, and of the 20 most expensive hospitalization conditions covered by \nMedicaid, 5 of them are related to perinatal experiences [page 4].  Cesarean births are a huge \npiece of this, in that they cost twice as much as a vaginal birth, representing an additional \n$4,500 per client. \n \nDoulas have been shown to meet what the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services  \nNational  Quality  Strategy  calls  the  \"Triple  Aim,\"  which  is  not  only  improving  health \noutcomes and quality of care, but also increasing cost savings [page 5].  This is the Cochrane \nanalysis, which shows that not only are doulas effective in decreasing cesarean births, almost \nby 30 percent, and preterm births, as well as other expensive and high-touch intervention \nsuch as vacuum extractions and epidurals [page 7], but it also increases the self-reports of \nclients who say they have more positive birth experiences with doulas. \n \nWhen we factor in cost-saving potential, just factoring in the primary cesarean rate by \nreducing unnecessary primary cesareans, it reflects at least $15 million of projected savings a \nyear.  That is not including subsequent cesareans, costs associated with preterm births, and \nother high-cost interventions such as epidurals, et cetera. \n \nI hope you will see that there is extensive evidence that backs up doulas as an intervention \nthat meets the triple aim.  A recent Cochrane Systemic Review indicated that all women \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 24, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nshould have continuous support during labor, and that there are no known harms of doula \ncare [page 8].  The American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology did an extensive review \nof 41 birth practices, and doulas were one of only three to receive an \"A\" grade.  They \nrecommended that continuous labor support, such as that provided by doulas, to be one of the \nmost effective interventions to improve labor and delivery outcomes.   \n \nThank  you  for  your  time  and  consideration  and  thinking  about  how  this  is  really  an \nintervention that serves so many purposes for the state of Nevada and the people who live \nhere. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nI am going to close this presentation with a screen shot.  [unable to share screen]   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nYou will have the opportunity to make a closing statement after the conclusion of testimony \nand questions, so we can come back to you.  In the meantime, we can have someone from \nour technical services unit help you with that. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nThat is fine. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo you have any other presenters? \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nNo, that is it.  You have heard our story.  We will be available for questions. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAt this time, I will pause the hearing on A.B. 256 and move into our work session.  I will \nbegin the work session with Assembly Bill 96.  Mr. Ashton will provide a summary of the \nbill and the amendment. \n \nAssembly  Bill  96:    Creates  the  Emergency  Response  Employees  Mental  Health \nCommission. (BDR 40-96) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \nJust as a reminder, as nonpartisan staff I cannot advocate nor oppose any measures you will \nconsider today.  You should have received the work session document by email, and you can \nalso find it on the Nevada Electronic Legislative Information System.  Assembly Bill 96 was \nheard on March 17, 2021.  The proposed amendment to this bill will replace the contents of \nA.B. 96, so I will go straight to the amendments.  Attached is the proposed conceptual \namendment for A.B. 96 [page 2, Exhibit D].  Assemblywoman Lesley E. Cohen proposes to \nreplace the contents of A.B. 96 with the following provisions:   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 24, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \n1.  Add a section authorizing a governmental entity that licenses and regulates first \nresponders  to  enter  into  a  contract  with  a  nonprofit  organization  to  carry  out  a \nprogram to provide peer support counseling for first responders.  Such contract must \nrequire the nonprofit organization to:  (1) Establish and operate a toll-free hotline for \nemergency response employees; (2) Establish and maintain a network of peer support \ncounselors  to  provide  peer  support  counseling  to  persons  who  call  the  toll-free \nhotline; and (3) Establish and maintain an Internet website that provides certain \ninformation. \n \n2.  Require the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health \nand  Human  Services  to  post  on an  Internet website  maintained  by the  Division \ninformation  concerning  peer  support  services  available  to  emergency  response \nemployees. \n \n3.  To the extent of available funding, require the Division to collect and report certain \ninformation relating to suicide or suicide attempts by emergency response employees \nto the chief medical officer.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any questions from Committee members before we take a motion?  Seeing none, \ndo I hear a motion to amend and do pass A.B. 96? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS MADE A MOTION TO AMEND AND DO \nPASS ASSEMBLY BILL 96. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  BENITEZ-THOMPSON  SECONDED  THE \nMOTION. \n \nIs there any discussion on the motion? \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nAlthough I certainly appreciate what the bill is attempting to do, I do not think it reaches or \neven comes close.  I am concerned that there is some duplication of services.  Mandating a \ntoll-free hotline for first responders is also a duplication of services, and we really need to be \nconcentrating on the \"988\" hotlines, so for that and several other reasons, I will be voting no \non this bill. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIs there any other discussion from Committee members?  [There was none.]   \n \nTHE  MOTION  PASSED.    (ASSEMBLYMEN  BLACK,  HAFEN, \nKRASNER, MATTHEWS, AND TITUS VOTED NO.) \n \nThe motion carried.  I will assign the floor statement to Assemblywoman Cohen. \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 24, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nNext, we will move on to Assembly Bill 192.  \n \nAssembly Bill 192:  Revises provisions governing the testing of pregnant women for \ncertain sexually transmitted infections. (BDR 40-453) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \nThe Committee heard Assembly Bill 192 on March 10, 2021.  The bill requires a physician \nor other person who attends to a pregnant woman to examine and test the woman for certain \nsexually transmitted infections unless the woman opts out of such examination and testing.  \n \nAdditionally, the bill: \n \n•  Requires an emergency department in a hospital or other medical facility admitting a \npregnant woman to examine the woman for syphilis under certain circumstances; \n•  Revises the times at which a pregnant woman must be tested for syphilis; \n•  Replaces the misdemeanor violation for violating syphilis testing requirements with a \ncivil penalty; \n•  Authorizes  the  imposition  of  a  civil  penalty  against  a  person  who  violates  the \nrequirements concerning testing for certain sexually transmitted infections; and \n•  Removes the penalty for a pregnant woman who refuses treatment for syphilis. \n \nCommittee members, the attached conceptual amendment is a new version just provided to \nthe Committee recently.  The only change to the amendment is in item 5 of the bill, and you \nwill also see an updated conceptual amendment attached to this bill page [page 3, Exhibit E].   \n \nAmendment 1 replaces references to \"a laboratory approved by the State Board of Health\" in \nsections 1 and 2 of the bill with \"a laboratory licensed pursuant to Chapter 652 of NRS.\" \n \nAmendment 2 removes provisions requiring that certain testing be done without charge. \n \nAmendment 3 clarifies that hospital emergency departments and medical facilities must: \n \na.  Ask women of childbearing age—as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention—whether they are pregnant. \n \nb.  Seek consent from the pregnant woman and commence treatment for syphilis if the \nblood test results show the woman is infected with syphilis and if the result is \nreceived while she is in the emergency department or medical facility. \n \nc.  Indicate  the  case  involved  a  pregnant  woman  when  notifying  the  local  health \nauthority of a confirmed case of syphilis in a pregnant woman. \n \nAmendment 4 removes in section 5 of Nevada Revised Statutes 442.010 the condition that \nthe pregnant woman may solely object to the taking of a blood sample or the serological test \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 24, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nbased on the tenets or practices of her religion, thereby allowing a pregnant woman to object \nfor any reason. \n \nAmendment 5, and this is where the actual change happens, requires a health insurance \nprovider regulated by the state of Nevada to pay for the examination and testing mandated by \nsections 1 and 2 of this bill, and clarifies that the insurer may not be required to pay more \nthan the lowest rate prescribed by contract between the insurer and the facility, provider, or \nlaboratory.  The change refers to \"the facility,\" and you can also find this in the conceptual \namendment [page 3, Exhibit E]. \n \nAmendment 6 revises the list of other medical facilities to which the requirements of this bill \napply, and a list of these facilities is in the work session document [page 2]. \n \nAmendment 7 clarifies in section 2, subsection 1, paragraph (c), that hospitals and other \nmedical facilities must test all pregnant women who are evaluated or treated in an emergency \ndepartment or other medical facility, regardless of their admission status. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you for that summary.  Do we have any questions from Committee members?  Seeing \nnone, do I have a motion to amend and do pass? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN GORELOW MADE A MOTION TO AMEND AND \nDO PASS ASSEMBLY BILL 192. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nIs there any discussion on the bill? \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nUnfortunately, I will not be in support of this bill.  I sat on the interim Legislative Committee \non Health Care and we did address the fact that Nevada ranks number one in neonatal \nsyphilis, which is not acceptable.  Unfortunately, I do not feel this bill will solve that, and it \nalso may expand some other concerns that we did not seek—asking that these tests be done, \nfining providers, extending it to not just labor and delivery or emergency hospitals but also to \npsychiatric hospitals, rural clinics, and mobile units that may not have that testing available \non site, and then fining them if they do not give that test.  The fact that these tests can take \ndays to get back and then holding someone liable for those is not acceptable to me. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIs there any other discussion on the measure?  We have the bill's sponsor present here. \n \nAssemblywoman Lesley E. Cohen, Assembly District No. 29: \nWhen this came out of the interim committee, it was unanimous except for Senator Hardy \nand Assemblywoman Titus.  The concern they voiced was that the Department of Health and \nHuman Services and the Nevada Hospital Association did not have an agreement.  In fact, \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 24, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nthey have just recently come to an agreement, which was why we were not able to have the \ncomplete work session document to you earlier.  We actually reduced the number of medical \nfacilities.  We took out a lot of medical facilities compared with how the bill came out of the \ninterim committee. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nMadam Secretary, please call the roll. \n \nTHE  MOTION  PASSED.    (ASSEMBLYMEN  BLACK,  HAFEN, \nKRASNER, MATTHEWS, AND TITUS VOTED NO.) \n \nI will assign this floor statement to Assemblywoman Cohen as well.  Next, if we could begin \nthe work session on Assembly Bill 181. \n \nAssembly Bill 181:  Revises provisions relating to mental health. (BDR 40-522) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \nThe Committee heard Assembly Bill 181 on March 8, 2021.  Committee members, please be \nadvised that I sent you by email an updated work session document for A.B. 181 recently, \nand it is also updated on the Nevada Electronic Legislative Information System. \n \nAssembly Bill 181 requires health insurers that provide health coverage for their employees \nto comply with the federal Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and \nAddiction Equity Act of 2008, which prohibits group health plans and health insurance \nissuers that provide benefits for mental health or substance use disorders from imposing less \nfavorable benefit limitations on those benefits than on medical and surgical benefits.  The bill \nalso requires each insurer or other organization subject to those requirements to submit to the \ncommissioner  of  insurance  a  report  containing  certain  information  that  demonstrates \ncompliance with the Act.  This bill also requires the State Board of Health of the Department \nof Health and Human Services to adopt regulations requiring certain medical facilities and \nfacilities for the dependent to report information relating to suicide to the chief medical \nofficer; and authorizes the Division of Public and Behavioral Health, Department of Health \nand Humans Services, to take certain actions against a facility that fails to report the required \ninformation. \n \nDr.  Stephanie  Woodard,  Senior  Advisor  on  Behavioral  Health,  Division  of  Public  and \nBehavioral  Health,  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services,  has  submitted  the  first \namendment, and you will also see an attached memorandum titled \"AB181 (BDR 40-522) \nProposed Amendment\" [pages 5-12, Exhibit F].  This amendment:   \n \n1.  Removes language in the bill requiring certain facilities to report information relating \nto suicide to the chief medical officer.  Instead, it requires certain individual providers \nof health care to provide such information to the chief medical officer using the same \nprocedures as are currently used for providing information relating to communicable \ndiseases and drug overdoses. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 24, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nNext, Assemblywoman Peters proposes to amend the bill to: \n \n2.  Require the chief medical officer to annually submit to the executive director of the \nPatient Protection Commission, Office of the Governor, a written report summarizing \nany information relating to suicide received by him or her during the immediately \npreceding calendar year. \n \n3.  This  amendment  has  been  updated  from  the  previous  work  session  document \nI emailed to you last night.  Remove from section 9 insurers or other organizations \nproviding  health  care  coverage  pursuant  to  Nevada  Revised  Statutes  (NRS) \nChapter 287, thereby removing those entities from any requirement to adhere to the \nPaul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act \nand any reporting requirement prescribed in that section.  \n \nI will now move on to the conceptual amendment provided by the Division of Insurance of \nthe  Department  of  Business  and  Industry  which  is  also  attached  to  the  work  session \ndocument [pages 3 and 4, Exhibit F].  This amendment:  \n \n4.  Clarifies that the Division will collect and aggregate, but not analyze, any information \nprovided to the Division pursuant to section 9 of the bill. \n \n5.  Requires the commissioner to keep certain data confidential. \n \n6.  Requires the commissioner to annually submit to the executive director of the Patient \nProtection Commission, the Governor, and the Legislature, a written report, which \naggregates certain information received by the commissioner. \n \n7.  Authorizes the commissioner to adopt regulations relating to the collection of certain \ninformation  from  certain  insurers  and  other  organizations  providing  health  care \ncoverage. \n \n8.  Clarifies that an insurer or other organization providing health coverage may provide \na  copy  of  a  required  federal  report  as  required  by  Title II,  Section 203,  of  the \nConsolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 to the commissioner that demonstrates \ncompliance with the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and \nAddiction Equity Act.  The commissioner may request supplemental information \nfrom these entities if the federal report does not fulfill all the mental health parity \nrequirements set forth in federal law. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nCommittee, do you have any questions?  I know Assemblywoman Peters would like to make \na statement about the work session document and some of the amendments. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 24, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nThis was really a group effort, attacking the issues on both sides of what is the most \nimportant piece—the patient.  I want to thank all the stakeholders who worked with me on \nthis during the past couple of weeks and beyond.  I want to clarify that in the amendment, \nI proposed to remove the NRS Chapter 287 reference in section 9.  It really does not affect \nthe bill's efficacy; it comes in line with the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act \nwhich already exempts those programs.  I want to clarify that. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank  you  for  the  clarification,  but  I  am  looking  at  the  amendment  suggested  by \nDr. Stephanie Woodard, the green text.  There is a lot of text being removed, but then it looks \nas though we are moving existing language from another statute, NRS 441A.120, \"the Board \nshall adopt regulations . . . control of communicable diseases.\"  I believe the Board already \nhas regulations.  Is that new statute, because it is in green, which would be new wording?  It \nalso talks about adding the green language concerning suicide statistics in blue.  Are we \nchanging where that chapter is?  That language looks familiar, but it is written in green, so it \nlooks like new language. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nI believe Dr. Woodard is on the phone and can address that question. \n \nStephanie Woodard, Psy.D., Senior Advisor on Behavioral Health, Division of Public \nand Behavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services: \nThe conceptual amendment was not intending to change existing reporting requirements \nunder that section of existing statute but was to add into that same area of language the \nreporting requirements for suicide. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nMs. O'Krent, do you want to confirm this? \n \nKarly O'Krent, Committee Counsel: \nThat is correct.  The green language in NRS 441.120 is existing language, but we have \nsimply added the new requirements that will go into that same chapter. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIs there any further discussion on the matter?  [There was none.]  At this time, I will entertain \na motion. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  BENITEZ-THOMPSON  MADE  A  MOTION  TO \nAMEND AND DO PASS ASSEMBLY BILL 181. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nIs there any further discussion on the motion? \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 24, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nUnfortunately, I am going to vote no on this bill.  I think there is a lot of language in the bill \nthat is appropriate but premature and has not been really vetted.  The consequences of this \nlanguage, when we never did get a straight answer on a certain timetable, and I, as a \nprovider,  have  concerns  about  possible  suicide  attempts  versus  accidental  overdoses.  \nI understand what we are trying to achieve; I think this bill does not do that and it may add \nextra complications with false information and false reporting.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any further comments on the motion?  [There were none.] \n \nTHE  MOTION  PASSED.    (ASSEMBLYMEN  BLACK,  HAFEN, \nKRASNER, MATTHEWS, AND TITUS VOTED NO.) \n \nI will assign the floor statement to Vice Chair Peters. \n \n[Exhibit G was submitted but not discussed and will become part of the record.] \n \nAt this time, we will move on to our next bill, Assembly Bill 197.  Mr. Ashton, please \nsummarize the bill and any amendments. \n       \nAssembly Bill 197:  Revises provisions relating to persons experiencing homelessness. \n(BDR 11-682) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \nThe Committee heard Assembly Bill 197 on March 17, 2021.  It authorizes a minor who \ndemonstrates through documentary proof that he or she is living apart from his or her parents \nor legal guardian to consent to certain health examinations or services provided by certain \nproviders of health care for himself or herself or his or her child.  The bill removes the \nrequirement that a minor must have lived apart from his or her parents or legal guardian for a \nperiod of at least four months.  Additionally, the bill prohibits a local or state health officer, a \nlocal board of health, a licensed provider of health care, or a public or private hospital from \ndelaying or denying such examination or service because the minor refuses to consent to \ncommunication with his or her parent, parents, or legal guardian. \n \nThis bill also revises provisions that require the state registrar to provide birth certificates to a \nhomeless person free of charge in certain circumstances by removing a requirement that the \nperson must submit a signed affidavit on a form prescribed by the state registrar stating that \nthe person is homeless.  Instead, the person need only sign a statement that he or she is \nhomeless.  The state registrar is prohibited from requiring such a statement to be notarized. \n \nAssemblyman Howard Watts proposes the following amendments to section 1 of the bill:   \n \n1.  Replace \"mother\" with \"parent\" in subsection 1, paragraph (c) of Nevada Revised \nStatutes (NRS) 129.030; and \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 24, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \n2.  Replace \"in a physician's judgment\" with \"in a judgment of provider of health care\" \nin subsection 1, paragraph (d) of NRS 129.030. \n \nAdditionally, Joanna Jacob, Government Affairs Manager of Clark County, proposes the \nfollowing amendment: \n \n3.  Revise the bill to add child welfare agencies, acting as a custodian of a child, with \nthe intention to treat child welfare agencies the same as a parent or legal guardian. \n \nYou may also see the attached proposed amendment [page 2, Exhibit H]. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you for that summary of the bill.  We also have here the bill's sponsor, Assemblyman \nWatts, and I believe he wants to make a statement regarding the bill.  I appreciate everyone's \npatience.  As you know, a lot of these bills came out not necessarily representing the intent \nsome of the presenters assumed they would have, so there have been quite a few amendments \nand they have not all been drafted in their final forms yet. \n \nAssemblyman Howard Watts, Assembly District No. 15: \nI want to thank Assemblyman Orentlicher and Assemblywoman Titus whose suggestions led \nto the changes in proposed amendments 1 and 2.  There have been questions from some of \nmy colleagues about what impact this may have on consent for abortion care.  A legal \nopinion  was  provided  that  says  because  Nevada's  existing  parental  notification  statutes \nremain facially unconstitutional, a minor in Nevada has an existing constitutional right to \nobtain an abortion under NRS 442.250 without parental consent if the minor gives informed \nconsent under NRS 442.252 and NRS 442.253.   \n \nAssembly Bill 197 does not affect such an existing constitutional right.  If, in the future, a \nminor does not have such an existing constitutional right, for example, if Nevada adopts \nparental  notification  requirements  that  are  constitutionally  permissible,  then  Assembly \nBill 197 could, potentially, have some sort of impact, but as things stand right now, it would \nhave no impact on the ability of minors to seek abortion care with or without the consent of a \nparent.  I wanted to get that on the record. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any questions before we take a motion from Committee members?  \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank you, Assemblyman Watts, for that clarification and the additional language. I have a \nquestion about the amendment proposed by Clark County.  The way I am reading it, it says, \n\"The parent, parents, legal guardian, or custodian of a minor who receives an examination or \nservices . . . are not liable for the payment for that examination . . .\" [page 2].  Who is liable \nfor the exam?  Who pays for the cost of services?  Who will be held accountable? \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 24, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nAssemblyman Watts: \nFor that question, I would defer to Clark County, if they are available.  The intent they \nprovided during the hearing was to add parity between custodians and parents and legal \nguardians under existing statute. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe have Ms. Joanna Jacob here to answer that question. \n \nJoanna Jacob, Government Affairs Manager, Clark County: \nAssemblyman Watts summarized our intent in adding that to section 1, subsection 7.  The \nparents would not be liable for the cost if they did not consent.  The guardian would not be \nliable for the cost of care if that was not consented to.  I can see why that is the public policy \nbeing proposed here, and we were asking for parity in that sense.  Clark County's child \nwelfare tries to cover the cost for care of the children who are in our custody, and we make \nall efforts to do that, but we do have situations—runaways, et cetera.  We tried to work with \nArash Ghafoori and with the bill proponents behind this.  We are hoping there are very few \noccasions when this will have to be invoked, but the intent is to treat us as a parent or legal \nguardian.  The definition in the amendment—NRS 432B.060—for a custodian is actually \ndefined as a person or government organization other than a parent or legal guardian.  It is \nrecognizing that legal status of the custodian when we have legal custody of the child. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI was surprised to see this language here, because the purpose of the bill, from what I see, is \naddressing when the minor does not have a parent, guardian, or custodian.  Then, if they have \nthose, they give the consent for treatment.  This section of the bill does not address who will \npay if the parent, legal guardian, or custodian does give authorization.  We do not need this \nbill if they have received authorization, so I am wondering where that showed up in this bill. \n \nAssemblyman Watts: \nI want to note that this amendment was presented during the original hearing for the bill and \nthere were no questions about it at that time.  This justification for the amendment was \nprovided then.  The situation Ms. Jacob described was a runaway situation.  Again, if the \nchild is under the care of a custodian, then this would not apply; it is if a young person who \nhas run away, is homeless, and is not currently under the care of a parent, guardian, or \ncustodian. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there further questions from the Committee?  Seeing none, I will entertain a motion. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  BENITEZ-THOMPSON  MADE  A  MOTION  TO \nAMEND AND DO PASS ASSEMBLY BILL 197. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN GORELOW SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nDo we have any comments on the motion? \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 24, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI appreciate what this bill is trying to do—get health care—having been in emergency rooms \nso many times where I could not treat a child who shows up with a broken arm or other \ninjury until I got parental consent.  At the same time, there are some concerns we have \nregarding this bill and the question we asked of our legal counsel, and some other concerns \nregarding parental rights.  For that reason, unfortunately, I will have to vote no. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there further comments on the motion?  [There were none.] \n \nTHE  MOTION  PASSED.    (ASSEMBLYMEN  BLACK,  HAFEN, \nKRASNER, MATTHEWS, AND TITUS VOTED NO.) \n \nI will assign the floor statement to Assemblyman Watts.  If he is not available, we will have \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong be the backup. \n \nNext, we will move to Assembly Bill 217.  Mr. Ashton, will you please summarize the bill \nand its amendment. \n \nAssembly Bill 217:  Requires training for unlicensed caregivers at certain facilities. \n(BDR 40-454) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \n[Patrick  Ashton  presented  the  work  session  document,  Exhibit  I.]    Assembly  Bill  217 \nrequires the administrator or other person in charge of designated medical facilities, facilities \nfor the dependent, and other licensed facilities to ensure that each unlicensed caregiver at the \nfacility completes certain training, including training on the topic of the control of infectious \ndiseases.  The measure requires the State Board of Health of the Department of Health and \nHuman Services to adopt regulations prescribing training for unlicensed caregivers who \nprovide care at such facilities.  The administrator or other person in charge of such a facility \nshall ensure the implementation of best practices taught in the required training and shall \ndevelop, annually update, and provide to certain persons a written plan for the control of \ninfectious diseases at the facility. \n \nFinally, this bill requires the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department \nof  Health  and  Human  Services  to  post  on  the  Internet  a  list  of  nationally  recognized \norganizations  that  offer  free  or  low-cost  training  that  meets  the  requirement  of  those \nregulations.  There were no amendments. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAssemblywoman Cohen is here.  Do you have any further statements to make on this bill?   \n \nAssemblywoman Lesley E. Cohen, Assembly District No. 29: \nThis bill came out of the interim Legislative Committee on Health Care unanimously.  I do \nnot have any amendments, but there have been some stakeholders who did request that some \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 24, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \ninformation be put on the record.  Even though some of that was addressed at the hearing, I \nwill quickly go through it.  To be clear, when we are talking about unlicensed workers, we \nare not talking about friends and family caregivers.  There is language in some statutes \nhaving to do with that, so that is not an issue here.   \n \nAdditionally, to be very clear, it is the intent of this bill that the training be for no cost or at \nminimal cost.  It is also the intent of the legislation not to add extra training hours, but to help \nthe Department of Health and Human Services prioritize trainings to make sure unlicensed \ncaregivers are given focused training based upon the most recent surveys and citations \navailable.  That is not saying that the Board cannot add extra training hours if they believe it \nis necessary, but we are not looking to duplicate any training people are already receiving. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there other questions from the Committee?  [There were none.]  Do we have a motion? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN BENITEZ-THOMPSON MADE A MOTION TO DO \nPASS ASSEMBLY BILL 217. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nDo we have any comments on the motion? \n \nAssemblyman Hafen: \nI appreciate the bill's sponsor bringing this forward from the interim committee; however, \nI still have concerns over who is going to be covering this additional training, and therefore, \nat this time, I will vote no. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there other comments from Committee members on the motion?  [There were none.] \n \nTHE  MOTION  PASSED.    (ASSEMBLYMEN  BLACK,  HAFEN, \nKRASNER, MATTHEWS, AND TITUS VOTED NO.) \n \nAt this time, I will assign the floor statement to Assemblywoman Cohen, and the backup will \nbe Assemblyman Orentlicher. \n \nI will go back to Assembly Bill 216.  Mr. Ashton, will you please summarize this bill and \nthis amendment.  \n      \nAssembly  Bill  216:    Requires  Medicaid  to  cover  certain  services  for  persons  with \ncognitive impairments. (BDR 38-385) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \nAssembly Bill 216 requires the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services \n(DHHS) to include in the State Plan for Medicaid coverage for cognitive assessment and care \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 24, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nplanning services for persons who exhibit signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment.  The \nCommittee heard this bill on March 15, 2021.   \n \nDena Schmidt, Administrator, Aging and Disability Services Division, DHHS, proposes the \nfollowing amendments to section 1 of the bill, which are also attached [page 2, Exhibit J]: \n \n1.  Revise subsection 1 to state that a person who \"experiences\" signs or symptoms of \ncognitive impairment instead of a person who \"exhibits\" them shall be included in the \nState Plan for Medicaid coverage for cognitive assessment and care planning services, \nwith the intention to ensure self-reporting patients or caregivers are not precluded \nfrom these services. \n \n2.  Remove subsection 2, paragraph (d), \"Judgment as it relates to safety awareness\" \nfrom the definition of cognitive impairment to align it with medical terminology.  \nAdditionally, clarify that a person may have any one or all of the deficiencies outlined \nin this subsection. \n \nAssemblywoman  Titus  proposes  the  following  amendment  to  section  1,  also  attached \n[page 3]: \n \n3.  Revise subsection 2 to exclude from the definition of \"cognitive impairment\" any \ncondition with temporary or reversible effects. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any questions from members of the Committee?  [There were none.]  Do I have \na motion to amend and do pass Assembly Bill 216? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN TITUS MADE A MOTION TO AMEND AND DO \nPASS ASSEMBLY BILL 216. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN BLACK SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nIs there any discussion or comments on the motion?   \n \nAssemblyman Hafen: \nI want to thank the bill presenter for reaching across the aisle and working with everyone to \nget this bill to a place where we could all support it.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI am sure Assemblywoman Gorelow appreciates that.  Do we have any other comments on \nthe motion?  [There were none.] \n \nTHE MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \nI will assign this floor statement to Assemblywoman Gorelow. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 24, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \n[Exhibit K was submitted but not discussed and will become part of the record.]   \n \nNow, we will go to our last bill, Assembly Bill 228.  Mr. Ashton, please summarize the bill \nand its amendments.    \n \nAssembly  Bill  228:    Establishes  provisions  relating  to  children's  advocacy  centers. \n(BDR 38-358) \n \nPatrick Ashton, Committee Policy Analyst: \nThe  Committee  heard  Assembly  Bill  228  on  March  17,  2021.    It  provides  for  the \nestablishment  of  children's  advocacy  centers  where  multidisciplinary  teams  work  to \ninvestigate and help children recover from abuse and neglect and to hold perpetrators of \nabuse and neglect of children accountable.  Requirements governing the credentialing and \noperation of such centers are specified in the bill.  The bill also requires the governing body \nof each county and each child welfare agency to ensure, to the extent that money is available, \nthat children who are victims of abuse or neglect have access to a multidisciplinary team \nthrough  a  children's  advocacy  center,  and  it  creates  the  Account  to  Support  Children's \nAdvocacy Centers in the State General Fund, administered by the Division of Child and \nFamily  Services,  and  prescribes  certain  provisions  related  to  the  administration  of  the \naccount. \n \nJesse Haw, Chair, Legislative Task Force, Children's Advocacy Centers of Nevada, proposes \nthe following attached amendments [pages 4 and 5, Exhibit L]: \n \n1.  Revise section 6, subsection 1, paragraph (b), to clarify that a children's advocacy \ncenter must operate in accordance with the standards prescribed by the National \nChildren's Alliance to the extent these standards do not conflict with federal or state \nlaw. \n \n2.  Clarify in section 6, subsection 4, that children do not have to be victims of abuse or \nneglect in order to access services of a children's advocacy center.  Also, clarify that \naccess to services is not limited to a multidisciplinary team. \n \n3.  Revise the bill to ensure all child welfare information can be shared with every \nmember of a multidisciplinary team to support a child's case, including cases with \nallegations of sexual assault by a child's relative who is not a caregiver. \n \nThe next amendment is from the Nevada Justice Association [page 3]: \n \n4.  Revise  section  6  to  provide  that  a  member  of  a  children's  advocacy  center's \nmultidisciplinary team is only immune from civil liability for any communication \nwith this team.  The immunity provisions in the bill for an employee or officer of a \nchildren's advocacy center are not modified by this amendment. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 24, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nAssemblywoman Brittney Miller proposes the following amendment to section 6 [page 2]: \n  \n5.  Revise  subsection  3  to  make  available  by  court  order  confidential  information \nmaintained by a children's advocacy center pursuant to this subsection. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAssemblywoman Miller is here.  I think she has some comments to make regarding some of \nthe amendments that were recently added. \n \nAssemblywoman Brittney Miller, Assembly District No. 5: \nI would like to thank everyone involved.  All of the amendments are friendly after a lot of \nhard work with multiple parties.  The amendments are friendly, and there will be one more \namendment submitted.  That amendment will be to add additional signers.  I knew that would \nnot hold up the work session process, but I will give that to the Committee. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have other comments? \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI support this concept and think it is important.  I appreciate everyone reaching out and there \nwere excellent advocates on this bill.  Looking at the amendment proposed by the Nevada \nJustice Association [page 3, Exhibit L], section 6, subsection 2, where \"An employee or \nofficer of a children's advocacy center or a member of a multidisciplinary team is immune \nfrom civil liability for any action or omission . . . .\"  You are striking \"action or omission\" out \nand only going to give them civil liability protection \"for any intra-team communications \nmade\"?  Are there statutes anywhere else that would give someone trying to do the right \nthing for these kids' immunity from civil liability?  Are we opening up a potential litigation \navenue for the Nevada Justice Association?  I am having concerns now that I am seeing this \namendment. \n \nAssemblywoman Miller: \nNo, we are not.  It is limiting, and that is where the word \"intra\" comes from so that the \npeople within the actual advocacy team are protected.  It is when we start going outside; for \ninstance, if we brought in another social service or other agency or even licensed health care \nprofessionals who all are covered under their own protection and insurance.  It was to rein it \nin because of the challenge of the definition of \"good faith.\"  \"Good faith\" covers a multitude \nof things.  We want everyone in the children's advocacy center to be protected to do the \nreporting they need to do, to have the privileged conversations and communications they \nneed to have, unless by court order, but to make sure it is specific to those who are trained \nand working within this multidisciplinary team. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nAs  a  teacher,  you  are  a  mandatory  reporter  for  certain  things;  as  a  physician,  I  am  a \nmandatory reporter for certain things.  If I do it in good faith, I am protected.  I report \nbecause I suspect child abuse.  I report that, and I do it in good faith.  If I see a broken arm in \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 24, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nthe emergency room, I report it because of mandatory reporting, and they come back and tell \nme I have accused them of being child abusers and it is not true.  I am protected because I did \nit in good faith.  I want to make sure that folks who work at the advocacy center and that \nteam are protected, so I needed clarification on that.   \n \nAssemblywoman Miller: \nThank you for that.  That is exactly the example I used in negotiating these amendments.  \nSometimes  it  comes  back  unsubstantiated,  but  civil  and  criminal  liability  cannot  come \nagainst us for doing what we did in good faith.  We followed our protocol. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any more questions for Assemblywoman Miller or our legal counsel regarding \nthe amendments?  [There were none.]   Do we have a motion? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN BLACK MADE A MOTION TO AMEND AND DO \nPASS ASSEMBLY BILL 228. \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN  BENITEZ-THOMPSON  SECONDED  THE \nMOTION. \n \nAre there any comments or discussion on the motion? \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI am going to support this and vote it out of Committee with the right to change my vote \nbecause I still have some questions.  I support it conceptually, but I want to make sure the \namendments have not really changed it.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any other comments on the motion?  [There were none.] \n \nTHE MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \nI will assign the floor statement to Assemblywoman Miller.  If she is not available, I will ask \nAssemblywoman Krasner to be backup. \n \nWe  will  now  reopen  the  hearing  on  Assembly  Bill  256.    Assemblywoman  Summers-\nArmstrong, if you would like to conclude your presentation, you are welcome to do so now. \n \nAssembly Bill 256:  Provides for Medicaid coverage of doula services. (BDR 38-849) \n \nAssemblywoman Shondra Summers-Armstrong, Assembly District No. 6: \nI am ready for questions from the Committee. \n \nAssemblyman Matthews: \nHave other states adopted this and have provisions regarding this kind of coverage? \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 24, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nI will ask Quentin Savwoir to answer your question. \n \nQuentin Savwoir, Deputy Director, Make It Work Nevada: \nYes, this has passed in nearly two dozen states.  This particular legislation is actually \nmodeled after what has transpired in Oregon.  Since this passed in Oregon, they have seen \nsignificant cost savings to the state and a reduction in cesarean deliveries.  Different states \nhave implemented different models, but this legislation we are trying to pass in Nevada is \nmodeled on what has happened in Oregon. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank you for your personal story, Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong, for presenting \nthis bill, and sharing some of your personal events.  It is always good to know how and why \nthese bills get started.  My question revolves around current procedural terminology (CPT) \ncoding and Medicaid reimbursement.  Is the federal government okay with this?   \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nYes, that has been done in other states and I believe we have a representative from the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services who can speak to how that process works. \n \nDuAne Young, Deputy Administrator, Division of Health Care Financing and Policy, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services: \nThere are a variety of CPT codes.  Other states have set this up as either billing under the \nmedical professional or a separate provider type.  Much like community health workers, it \nhas evolved over the years, and we would treat this as a separate provider type whose codes \nwould be used in tandem with the supervising care physician. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nIs there one fee for the services?  Can it start at six months prior to delivery and does it \nfollow for a year after?  What does that scope look like? \n \nDuAne Young: \nThe majority of the states we have looked at have a bundled version of the CPTs, and we \nhave looked at that analysis separately.  We have not really decided how we will handle it.  \nWill they be separate visits, or will we do one bundled payment for both prenatal and \npostnatal services?  Ms. Lynch will testify later to some of the ideas we have on policy, but \nwe have not landed on what that methodology will be.  Most states do a bundled payment. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nAs a provider, I have delivered hundreds of babies.  The biggest risk for obstetrics and \ndelivery is liability insurance and outcomes.  Are they going to be mandated to have liability \ninsurance?  Who is going to be responsible for liability for bad outcomes? \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 24, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nDuAne Young: \nThere is a provision in the bill language as it is written that Medicaid would be the regulatory \nauthority.  That is not something we typically do, so we have spoken with Assemblywoman \nSummers-Armstrong  about  transferring  that  provision  to  the  Department  of  Health  and \nHuman Services (DHHS) as a whole.  The Bureau of Health Care Quality and Compliance \n(HCQC) most likely would have that oversight.  That would be based on their practice \nmodel, and perhaps Lauren Kalogridis or Alexandra Gunter could speak to that—how they \ncarry liability insurance in their model now.  I do not believe that would fall directly under \nthe provision of DHHS. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nWill DHHS establish a scope of practice?  Are you going to be mandated to do urinalysis for \nproteins and all those other things?  Who will be liable if they suspect preeclampsia and those \ntypes of things?  Who will set that scope of practice? \n \nDuAne Young: \nThe scope of practice would really be defined by the CPT codes for what they can bill \nMedicaid.  There would be certain provisions of the practice that will not be in billable CPT \ncodes or not be covered services, but those would not be reimbursed by Medicaid.  Those \nCPT codes are careful not to overstep or conflict with anything a physician or an advance \npractice registered nurse or nurse midwife is doing, but they are very specific and defined. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThere may be someone who can clarify that the doulas are support advocates and not medical \nprofessionals or nurses. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nI would like to ask Ms. Kalogridis to speak to the scope.  In our exhibits on the Nevada \nElectronic Legislative Information System (NELIS), there is one showing a side-by-side \ncomparison regarding what the role of a doula is. \n \nLauren Kalogridis, Program Manager, Thrive Wellness of Reno: \nDoulas are not medical professionals, so it is strictly out of scope for us to be doing anything \nlike urinalysis for proteins or assessing for signs of preeclampsia.  We do not take blood \npressure; we do not do cervical checks.  Medical tasks are not within our role.  It is really \nabout the emotional support, about providing resources and referrals to extra care.  For \nexample, if we notice a client reporting to us signs such as swelling in their legs, headaches, \nor dizziness, we might say they need to call their provider.  We might say, \"This is something \nthat is potentially risky, and you need to assess it with your provider.\" \n \nAs far as liability coverage, many doulas do carry their own professional liability coverage.  \nCM&F is a common company that offers coverage for doulas independently, and that has \nmore to do with the fact they come to our office space for prenatal services and if they trip \nand fall—those kinds of things.  It is still not about medical birth outcomes. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 24, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nMy life was made easier if someone was with the person in labor to coach them, and I always \nrecommended  that  couples  get  education  and  take  birthing  classes,  et  cetera.    Having \nsomeone by your side—your best friend, your mom, your aunt, whomever—is always great.  \nHowever, when you start hiring someone who is a professional coach, that is where I worry \nabout the liability and scope of practice.  What is the consequence if that person you hired \ndoes  not  recognize  something  or  says  something  they  should  not?    What  are  the \nconsequences if they practice outside their scope of practice? \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nMs. Gunter, you are in this space on a regular basis.  Could you speak to that, please? \n \nAlexandra Gunter, Doula, Reno Doula Project: \nWhen Anthem sponsored us to provide doula coverage to 50 of their members, I realized we \nhad a gap in our code of conduct.  I put together a code of conduct for the Reno Doula \nProject.  This is an example of making sure people are staying within their scope under our \nassociation.    Doulas  are  not  covered  under  the  Health  Insurance  Portability  and \nAccountability Act, but privacy is very important.  We are not mandated reporters, but \nreporting is important.  We have expectations of conduct and are reminding all our doulas \nthat we are not medical professionals, we are not to perform medical tasks.  Beyond that, if \nthere is an emergency, we are responsible for calling 911.  If any doula in our association \nwere to act outside this, we now have processes to expel them from our association.  I would \nhope other doula associations with reputations similar to what the Reno Doula Project has \nwould follow a similar course—making these very clear and writing these out.  It would not \nsurprise me, if we are a covered service under Medicaid, that it would be required for more \ndoulas to have agreements with associations and with Medicaid itself. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nThank you for bringing this bill.  I cannot tell you, over the past eight years, as I had my \nthree children and watched my friends have their children, how important doula services \nwere to the well-being of the moms in those cases.  Not everyone has a great relationship \nwith their mom, or their sister, or their aunt, or even have them left.  Sometimes you just \nneed that support.  It was invaluable for me.  I had my sister in my case, but I do not know \nwhat I would have done without that support during my three births. \n \nMy question has to with the kind of training standards that already exist.  Doulas go through \na process of learning how to be effective in the space they offer services in.  Can you talk a \nbit about what those training standards look like and what the breadth of services doulas are \nhired for can look like? \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nMs. Gunter, would you please speak to your scope at the Reno Doula Project? \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 24, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \nAlexandra Gunter: \nThere are a lot of training associations.  Because doulas are not regulated, the trainings are \nnot regulated, but they typically follow a similar format.  It is a multiday workshop where we \ntalk about what to cover during prenatals, how to stay within scope of practice during labor, \nhow to act and conduct yourself during a hospital birth and during a home birth, also \nknowing that we are not doing unassisted births so there is always a medical professional \nthere.  Also going over red flags for postpartum.  When doulas first came about in the United \nStates, it was for the white and privileged, so numerous associations have created trainings \nthat cover racial disparities.  There are trainings by Black women for Black women and other \nwomen of color.  Now there are even more trainings available, so it would be hard to say, \n\"only one training\" or \"only these trainings are acceptable.\"   \n \nCertification is similar.  Because doulas are not regulated, there is no way to know what a \ncertification truly means.  Again, making sure that whatever training association a doula is in, \nit  at  least  covers  scope  of  practice  and  at  least  covers  certain  aspects  would  be  more \nimportant than making sure that each individual doula is certified or making sure that the \ntrainings themselves are regulated.  There is a lot of work to be done in that area, but I have a \nlot of faith in the trainings that are in existence already. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nThe thing that is really important to talk about is that not every person needs exactly the same \nthing and it is not like a math equation—it is really about those personal relationships—\ninterviewing your provider for that service just like any other service you would ask for in \nthe spectrum of your life.  It is not a one-size-fits-all for everyone, and I think that is really \nvaluable to have in the community. \n \nMy other question concerns the breadth of service.  I know from  my pregnancies that \nprenatal care was very specific about my baby and about my health, but the postpartum care \nwas virtually nonexistent.  Can you talk a bit about how you provide services both before, \nduring, and after and how that can be unique to each service scenario? \n \nAlexandra Gunter: \nA typical model of care would be two prenatal appointments—not including an interview—\nso two prenatal appointments, the birth itself, and one postpartum visit.  It is one postpartum \nvisit at a minimum.  You can, of course, add more.  The postpartum visit typically happens \nabout a week or, hopefully, two weeks after the birth.  Doulas are not medically trained, but \nsome of us are lactation professionals.  We are not all lactation professionals; however, we \nare  trained  to  notice  red  flags  and  to  refer  out.    A  lot  of  times,  that  friendship,  that \nrelationship you create with your doula, has them checking in on the mom more often via \ntext message or phone conversations, depending on what the mom wants.  Typically, it is one \npostnatal visit which usually happens before the postnatal visit with the obstetrician, so there \nis  the  ability  to  notice  red  flags  before  they  would  be  seen  in-office  by  a  medical \nprofessional.  They would then be encouraged to see their medical professional early. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 24, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nWhat is important about this conversation is that doulas provide a unique and individualized \nservice to people depending on what they need and to expecting parents depending on what \nthey need.  That can be a wraparound service complementary to the medical help and \nmedical providers' services that are also regulated and taken into account and paid for \nthrough insurance processes during that birthing process.  That is really important.  One of \nthe  pieces  we  are  just  starting  to  fully  acknowledge  in  the  birthing  community  is  the \nimportance of mental health postnatal—mental health of moms and other parents.  Without \nsomeone  who  can  identify  that  or  who  is  trained  to  identify  that,  it  really  leaves  our \npopulations vulnerable to those unexpected senses of depression that I know from experience \nyou do not always see from the inside. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI have to admit, I am very naive concerning what a doula is and what they do.  I am learning \na lot.  I believe I heard it said that doulas exist and that there is a certification process for \nthem.  I am assuming the community self-regulates and the community self-identifies.  Is that \nhow that is right now? \n \nAlexandra Gunter: \nYes, I would say that we do self-regulate, and it is fairly important to self-regulate because \nwe, as individuals, can be kicked out of a hospital and told not to come back as a doula.  It \ncould also negatively impact the reputation of the association we are under.  Someone could \nsay \"We do not want any doulas from your association because they break rules, they do x, y, \nand z.\"  It is very important that we are recognized as professionals and not to overstep.  Of \ncourse, if we were to try to do a medical procedure, try to assess cervical dilation, tell a \ndoctor they are wrong or to stop in the middle of a medical procedure, we could be trespassed \nfrom the hospital and asked to leave.  We are very self-regulating to make sure we do not \nruin the reputation of those who are trying to do very important work. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI am a licensed social worker.  This is not calling for licensing, it is calling for registration.  \nFor most folks where there would be licensure, you are not allowed to represent yourself as \nbeing a member of the profession unless you were licensed as such.  Regardless of your \neducation  and  training  in  something,  unless  you  are  licensed,  you  will  not  be  able  to \nrepresent yourself as such, nor to hang out a shingle saying you were such.  Would you want \nthe same intent for this registration?  If you were registered and had met the requirements \nthat the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department of Health and \nHuman Services puts out, would you then be able to represent yourself as a doula but those \nwho are not registered would not be able to? \n \nAlexandra Gunter: \nI can see a situation where a registered doula will be very important, but in terms of a \ncertified doula, that depends on the educational body you attended.  For some associations, \nthere are yearly fees and certain follow-up continuing education that for some women, \nespecially lower-income women who are trying to make a living as doulas, can be prohibitive \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 24, 2021 \nPage 27 \n \nto remaining a certified doula.  I never certified as a birth doula, and I consider myself to still \nbe an expert in this area.  Having registered doulas within the state of Nevada so we can get \nreimbursement  from  Medicaid  sounds  completely  reasonable,  but  in  terms  of  requiring \ncertification from the many different training bodies—because we are not regulated like a \nsocial worker or like a clinical psychologist—it does not look the same, so I do not think it \nwould have the same effects. \n \nQuentin Savwoir: \nI wanted to add to what Alexandra Gunter was saying.  I want to be careful about the \nlanguage  we  are  using.    I  know  there  is  a  lot  of  conversation  in  the  Legislature \n[unintelligible]. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nI am having a lot of trouble understanding what you are saying.  I do not know if it is the \nmicrophone, but I missed most of what you said. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI agree. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nMr. Savwoir, if you would turn off your camera, that might help.  You may be having some \nissues with the Internet. \n \nQuentin Savwoir: \nI want to be very clear about the language we are using.  What we are saying is we want \ndoulas in the state to provide training, and we want them to provide documentation of \ntraining, for instance the training Ms. Gunter described—the multiday training where they \nare taught how to identify things that would need to be escalated to a medical professional.  \nAgain, this is a nonmedical role that is providing education, advocacy, emotional support, \nand all things we would be doing for our friends, for our family, just in a dynamic where you \nare having to coach an expectant parent or mother through their pregnancy process.   \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nI had my last child in a hospital setting with folks who were certified and registered.  I had a \nstandard U.S.A. birth, and my youngest son was born healthy, we thought.  Those folks who \nwere certified and trained and who were supposed to take care of me and him set us up in a \nroom that was freezing cold.  He ended up under a heat lamp for six days because he got \nhypothermia.  I think we need to make sure we are not conflating these roles.  This is a \nsupport person for the mom.  She is not a medical professional and we do not see anywhere \nany need for he or she to be certified, but registered, some type of process set up so there is \ntraining that is both culturally competent, that completely covers the scope of what we want \nbirth doulas to do.  We have amazing and intelligent women in our state who are in this \nspace.  They are more than able to work together with our government officials to come up \nwith a scope of training that needs to be done so they can do this work for moms. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 24, 2021 \nPage 28 \n \nAssemblywoman Krasner: \nMy question is for Ms. Gunter.  You were talking about doulas being able to help diagnose \npostpartum or mental health.  Could you expand on that? \n \nAlexandra Gunter: \nWe are not qualified to give an assessment, but we can point women into the direction of \nassessments, like the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, for example.  We can say, \"Why \nnot fill this out?  If you test in a particular way, it might be important to have a conversation \nwith your provider about this.\"  We are trained to recognize different types of perinatal \nmental health issues, so if we notice something, we are also able to point out that something \nmay not necessarily be normal, and ask, \"Do you think you need help in this area, or do you \nthink perhaps getting in touch with a therapist or getting some group therapy, some support \ncircles, could help you in this area?\"  Again, we are being very careful in our language when \nwe speak to moms to not diagnose, to not say things like, \"You have depression.\"  We can \nsay, \"You know, this is not necessarily normal.  Postpartum depression is something that \ncould be happening in this situation; do you think you might want to explore this more with a \nprofessional?\" \n \nStaying within our scope has a lot to do with language and how we present things to moms, \nbut definitely, mental health is a component of what we focus on, both prenatally and \npostpartum. \n \nLauren Kalogridis: \nThat is the exact intersection of a lot of my work, because I am a clinical social work intern, \nso I work as a perinatal psychotherapist treating clients with perinatal mood and anxiety \ndisorders and anxiety depression.  I also work as a doula, so the way I might describe the \ndifference between the two is that they are not diagnosing, but they are noticing red flags.  \nThe beauty of a doula is that they are oftentimes in the home, oftentimes they have access to \npartners, oftentimes clients will end up sharing things about their experience emotionally \nwith their doula prior to being able to be vulnerable with a therapist, and so they are getting \ninside information.  What they probably need to do is just notice what is normal and what is \nnot normal. \n \nIn Reno, we have done a lot of work recently, with Thrive Wellness of Reno particularly, in \nestablishing really strong and swift referral systems between the Reno Doula Project, Bright \nHeart, and other doulas in the area with our mental health providers.  If the doula sees \nsomething escalating quite quickly, they can reach out and say we need some intervention, \nsome mental health interventions quickly.  Twenty percent of people experience perinatal \nmood and anxiety disorder.  That is quite underreported.  The quicker we can get them into \ncare,  the  better  chance  we  have  at  intervening  to  protect  the  bonding  and  attachment \nexperience between parents and children because that is so crucial and can escalate very \nswiftly into a number of adverse childhood experiences we see related to untreated perinatal \nmood and anxiety disorders.  I hope that spoke to the bridge, but the distinction. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 24, 2021 \nPage 29 \n \nAssemblywoman Krasner: \nI thought in the presentation they said that doulas are not certified, some are registered, and \nsome are not.  Some have the training, and some do not.  If they are not all certified or all \nregistered, and they are not all receiving the same training, how do we know they are able to \nspot these mental health issues or postpartum issues?  Maybe one thinks it is and makes a \nreport that is false, and the person is really not having a mental health issue.   \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nMs. Kalogridis, you have worked both here and in New York. Could you speak to the scope \nof training you have seen in both locales? \n \nLauren Kalogridis: \nAs far as the scope of training, topics that are generally covered as standard practice—for \nexample, Dona International is one of the largest doula training organizations in the country.  \nThe downside of an organization like that is that it often does not have the culturally humble \nlens and the culturally sensitive lens that is so rooted in community issues, particularly in \nterms of the maternal mortality crisis for women of color and things like that.  Just because \nthere are differences in topics reflected in the different training orgs—for example, in New \nYork I trained under the org called Ancient Song Doula Services.  Ancient Song covered all \nthe same things as Dona International, things like comfort measures, things like positions of \nthe baby in utero, things like education about common scenarios in labor and helping people \nthink through what their birth preferences would be, basics of breast feeding, things like that.  \nIn addition to all those standard core content areas, they also talked about the Black maternal \nmortality crisis in this country and the way that rates of sexual violence can show up to \nimpact different communities more. \n \nPart of the specifics about trying not to narrow in, saying, \"we need you to certify under this \none doula training organization,\" is that sometimes there is a risk of not meeting the whole \nneeds of the community.  I think that is what folks were speaking to earlier.  As far as the \npiece around the risk of referring someone who might not actually have a perinatal mood and \nanxiety disorder—it is about preventive care in a lot of ways.  There is not actually a \ndetriment in the way that I see it as a mental health care professional, but if someone is \ngetting to us, part of our job is to do the assessment.  It is not the doula's job, it is our job to \nask if a person needs case management services, do you need WIC [Special Supplemental \nNutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children], do you need outpatient therapy, do \nyou need intense outpatient therapy?  That is our scope of practice as a mental health \nprofessional, and we welcome people getting them to us even if the person is not in a full-\nblown perinatal mood and anxiety disorder stage.   \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nAssemblywoman Krasner, she is speaking about her role as a social worker, being able to do \nthe diagnosis—that is her role.  She is interested in and encouraging the role that the doula, \nwho has a relationship with that mom, may be able to see that there are issues that may need \nto be addressed and to have that relationship built that she can move her into the space of a \nhealth care professional to get her what she may want or may need.  When we are talking \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 24, 2021 \nPage 30 \n \nabout the scope of the doula service, that doula is going to see that mom within the first or \nsecond week after the baby is born.  Generally speaking, the post-birth appointment with the \ndoctor is weeks out, and many things can happen, as far as mental health or any other \nsituation, in between then.  That doula has access to that mom; they have a relationship.  That \ndoula can assess the differences, they have that type of core training, and move that mom \nalong to a professional so there can be an intervention before it becomes a crisis. \n \nAssemblyman Hafen: \nIt  was  stated  that  there  were  approximately  two  dozen  other  states  that  are  doing  this \nreimbursement.  Could you provide us with a breakdown of which states are requiring \nregistered doulas versus certified doulas?  I am curious to see what the other states are doing \nin that regard.   \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nWe will gather some data and get it out to the entire Committee. \n \nQuentin Savwoir: \nWe are happy to follow up with the entire Committee with the information you requested, \nAssemblyman Hafen.  I want to clarify that we are using a lot of terms, and I do not want the \nintention of the legislation to be confused.  The registration we are discussing is for the \npurposes of Nevada's Medicaid Services office for purposes of accountability of how the \nfunds are being spent.  \"Registration\" in this legislation is talking about registering with the \noffice of Medicaid within DHHS.  Other states have set forth other provisions and have \nrequired doulas to be certified or licensed.  That is not what we are proposing.  There has \nbeen research that has proven that when you create additional barriers to entry, it does lack \ncultural competency and the trainings associated to help Black and Brown women and Native \nAmerican women proves that consistently across all the studies.  Again, I am happy to \nresearch and follow up with the Committee, but I want to make sure that we are using the \nproper  terminology  so  we  are  not  confusing  the  intention  of  what  we  are  hoping  to \naccomplish with Assembly Bill 256. \n \nAssemblyman Hafen: \nI want to make sure my question is very clear.  In section 1, subsection 1, we are directing the \ndirector to address  the  \"registered\"  doulas.   In  there  it is  very specific  that this  is  for \n\"registered\" doulas, so my question is, what are other states doing?  Are they doing the \nregistered doula or are they doing the certified doulas, and that is the information I am \nrequesting. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI am sure Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong will get that information to Patrick Ashton, \nour committee policy analyst, and he will distribute it to the rest of the Committee. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nI really appreciate this conversation and discussion around this variety of services doulas \nprovide and how that functions.  It is really important to acknowledge that doulas are hired to \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 24, 2021 \nPage 31 \n \nfocus on the moms, and everyone else is focused on the baby.  When you give birth, your \nobstetrician focuses on the baby's health and your body's health.  The pediatrician is focused \non the baby's health; there is no one exclusively there to focus on the mom's well-being.  As \nthe mother of three kids, in the first three days after my babies were born, no one asked how I \nwas doing.  It was always about the baby.  Having a doula who was specifically there, hired \nby the mom, to support her in those sometimes traumatic and vulnerable moments, is so \nimportant for the health and well-being of both mom and baby in the long run.  I think that is \nvery important to clarify. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAt this time, we are going to hear testimony in support, opposition, and neutral on A.B. 256.   \nWe will begin testimony in support of A.B. 256. \n \nAshley Dodson, representing Make It Work Nevada: \nI am a licensed social worker and representative of Make It Work Nevada in support of \nA.B. 256.    I  am  also  a  Black  mother  of  five  children  who  has  had  several  traumatic \npregnancies  and  birthing  experiences  due to the  lack  of education,  empathy  during  the \nbirthing process, and care that I should have received during and after pregnancy.  Lying on a \ntable to give birth to a precious life can be mentally daunting when thoughts include, \"Will I \nlive and will my child live?\"  Alongside the emotional and mental abuse I endured while \nbeing threatened by a white male doctor who [unintelligible] with a cesarean section is told \nthat if I did not hurry and push the baby out soon—after two hours of me pushing—and only \nreceiving comfort from the nurse on duty, my fiancé, and mother.  Had I had a doula, this \nmost likely would have gone a different way.  Assembly Bill 256 is about our mothers and \nour children and ensuring they have a wholesome and healthy start in their lives.  Doulas \nplay an essential role in providing care, support, and advocacy to mothers and birth parents \nbefore, during, and after the pregnancy.  My personal experiences often left me advocating \nfor myself, even through the most difficult part of the process—to push and deliver the baby.  \nAs you can imagine during that time, one is extremely exhausted and filled with anxiety. \n \nStatistics show that preterm birth rates for Black women are especially higher than that of \ntheir white [audio was lost]. \n \nAssembly Bill 256 is the start of improving birth outcomes for mothers and birth parents in \nNevada.  This bill is community-driven public policy that tackles the racial and reproductive \ninjustices that Black women and other communities of color face.  In states that passed \nlegislation similar to A.B. 256, they have shown cost savings to the state by reducing the \namount of C-section births as well as birth parents reporting improved birth outcomes and \noverall experiences.  As a Black mother first and foremost, I urge the Committee to support \nand pass A.B. 256. \n \nErika Minaberry, Private Citizen, Reno, Nevada: \nI became a birth doula in 2015 after experiencing three traumatic births.  My first birth ended \nin a cesarean section because I did not know what my rights were as a patient and I did not \nknow what to expect with labor.  Those two factors not only led to my cesarean, but also led \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 24, 2021 \nPage 32 \n \nto massive struggles with breast feeding, postpartum depression, and six scar adhesions \ngrowing in my abdomen that had to be scraped out in a major abdominal surgery before they \ngrew to the point of cutting off circulation to my organs.  Medicaid will be covering that \nsurgery.  I became a doula because if I had doula support during my first birth, I would have \nbeen able to avoid the multiple costly health issues that were born from my ignorance of the \nlabor process.  Doulas provide that information as one of the core competencies of our work.   \n \nMy story is not unique.  The informational, physical, and emotional support we are trained to \nprovide, statistically improves birth outcomes, mental health, and saves money.  Considering \nthe abysmal statistics America has in maternal and infant mortality, providing doula support \nfor families makes sense both morally and economically.  On behalf of struggling new \nparents too overwhelmed to testify, for all the parents who are mourning the loss of their \nbabies, and for the babies who are mourning the loss of their parents, I implore you to please \nvote yes on A.B. 256. \n \nTiara Moore, Housing Justice Organizer, Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada: \nI am here in support of A.B. 256.  As the mother of six, I had a doula with my last child.  My \ndoula was not only important for not only being a part of the health care system but also part \nof the child's life as well.  My last child, my one-year-old, we had a doula throughout our \npregnancy, and I received very good care.  Because of my doula, I was able to fully recover \nand my baby was very healthy.  Doulas are an effective part of the health care system.  The \ncultural competence of doulas is to provide support and care during the birth. With doulas \nassisting, mothers are four times less likely to have low-birth-weight babies, two times less \nlikely to experience birth complications involving themselves and their babies, and less likely \nto receive cesarean sections.  It helps with the breastfeeding process as well.  They are there \nto support, and with my sixth child I was able to have that support, and with my seventh, I \nplan on having the support as well.  Medicaid coverage for doulas will ensure that future \nNevadans,  regardless  of  their  family's  economic  status,  are  born  with  the  best  possible \noutcomes.  I encourage you to support A.B. 256. \n \nLashonda Marve-Austin, Private Citizen, Reno, Nevada: \nI am a Black mother of three.  I am in support of A.B. 256 because I lost nine children before \ngiving birth to the two I have now.  If I had that support, I think I would have known what \nquestions I could have asked.  They would have been able to recognize things that were not \ncorrect.  I also had an issue with my three-year-old.  I did not receive any postpartum care \nhere in Nevada.  I was distressed and I was not able to care for my child.  I was threatened \nwith my kids being removed from my home because I was not able to properly care for them \nbecause my mental capacity was not where it needed to be.  After reaching out to my health \ncare provider multiple times asking for a prenatal appointment, with them responding that \nthey were overbooked, had a doula been available, she could have been there to advocate for \nme and also support me when I was falling and about to lose my children.   I am in full \nsupport of A.B. 256.  \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 24, 2021 \nPage 33 \n \nTara Raines, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \nThank you for the opportunity to speak in support of A.B. 256.  I am speaking first in my \ncapacity as a Black mother.  I was fortunate to be able to afford doula care when delivering \nmy daughter.  Given what I knew about the Black maternal health crisis and the outcomes, it \nwas important to me that a Black woman was present at my birth to advocate on my behalf.  \nTo me, her support was invaluable.  She assisted us in preparing our home for my daughter \nbefore I delivered, she prepared me and my partner for what labor and delivery could look \nlike, and she really helped set our expectations for what those first few days with our little \none might bring.  She was a pillar of strength as I labored, and she offered support both to me \nand also my partner during the long hours before my delivery.  After the birth, my doula \ncame to the home to help with tasks ranging from prepping meals to swaddling the baby to \nhelping me figure out how to use the new Moby Wrap infant carrier I struggled with in those \nearly days. \n \nThis support should be available to every birthing person who wants it.  We know the \npresence of doulas reduces mental health crises after birth and increases breast feeding, \nwhich is important both to bonding but also has long-term nutrition and health outcomes.  \nI implore you to pass this bill, as we in Nevada need this support. \n \nCristina Hernandez, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \nI am here in support of A.B. 256.  I have been a birth worker/doula since 2016 in Las Vegas.  \nDuring my tenure, I have seen the impact doulas provide.  Just last year, a local group of us \nwere able to provide doula services via grant funding to victim survivors of sexual assault \nand domestic violence.  We were able to see firsthand what we already knew—that it made a \nsignificant difference in the birth experiences and during the postpartum process for our \nclients.  Having a doula is not a luxury, it is a necessity and one all birthing people should \nhave access to.  In closing, I also ask that you ensure you pay doulas a living wage and make \nlanguage inclusive of all birthing people since not all birthing people identify as women.  \n \nMiaya Bennett, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \nI am a Black mother advocating for this doula bill, A.B. 256.  I have two young children, \nthree and two years old.  I had a doula so I know the importance of needing a doula because I \nknow people who did not have them.  On my journey of learning what it is to be a mother, to \nhave a child, everything that you need to know before the baby comes—my doula was able \nto help me with that.  I was able to take classes; I was able to learn about the truth and the \nmyths about labor, about birth, about the child, about the expectancy of the baby, and what is \nto come.  I feel like it is very important.  I know that with my first child I had preeclampsia.  \nI had to have an emergency C-section, and it would have been very scary had I not had my \ndoula there to explain what preeclampsia was and make me feel better.  My doctors were \nvery straightforward.  They did not care about me emotionally and how I was going to take \nthe news.  I assumed my pregnancy would go the way I wanted it to go.  My doula was the \nonly person who was able to make me understand why it was the safest for myself and for \nmy child.  She gave me the information I needed to educate me about what exactly I was \ngoing through and what I needed to do.  I was looking to have a home birth with my son, and \nI did not get to have that home birth.  I was blessed enough to be able to pay for all the \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 24, 2021 \nPage 34 \n \nmidwifery clinic needs, and then when I went to the hospital, I was not treated as a patient of \nthe hospital because I did not have a specific doctor.  I was using the doctor that was \nassigned to me through that hospital. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWill you wrap up your testimony, please.  You are right at two minutes. \n \nMiaya Bennett: \nI just think it is very important to have a doula because they are able to help you learn the \nthings you do not know and the things you need to know to be comfortable and for your own \nmental health. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe have been going for 15 minutes.  I want to make sure I allocate enough time for neutral \nand opposition testimony.  If you are still on the line and want to present testimony in support \nof this bill, please do so in writing.  You can do so up to 48 hours after the conclusion of this \nhearing, and I would encourage you to do that.   \n \nAt this time, we will go to any callers in opposition to this bill.  [There were none.]  Are there \nany callers in neutral? \n \nErin Lynch, Chief, Medical Programs Unit, Division of Health Care Financing and \nPolicy, Department of Health and Human Services:  \nFor A.B. 256, the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy has estimated a cost savings \nof covering doula services as part of the State Plan for Medicaid.  This means that the \nbenefits of covering doula services far outweigh the costs of reimbursing doulas for their \nservices.  Many studies have shown that doulas can assist in reducing preterm births, number \nof  low-birth-weight  babies,  morbidity,  mortality  rates,  neonatal  intensive  care  unit \nadmissions, depression, and anxiety.  These studies have also shown us that doulas can assist \nwith improving outcomes for mothers and babies with reduced cesarean rates by providing \nlabor support toward a vaginal birth, decreased use of pain relief medications, and increased \nbreastfeeding rates.  All these outcomes help improve health care outcomes, lower health \ncare costs, increase quality of care, and may even reduce health care disparities.  Nevada \nMedicaid utilized many doula studies and the cost savings to Medicaid programs.  Reviewing \nall of these, our analysis used the cost-saving methodologies in these studies to determine \nthere would be a cost savings to Nevada Medicaid if we reimbursed doulas for their services.  \nOverall, I am really pleased to say that our analysis resulted in a cost savings of over \n$1.2 million.  That includes the medical side of our savings and our system costs, like having \nto create a new provider type and mapping codes.  Overall, it would be a cost saving. \n \nAdditionally, as DuAne Young stated, the Division is also working with the bill's sponsor on \nthe portion of the bill regarding oversight for registration for doulas.  We are looking at how \nto figure that out.  Also, I wanted to help answer the question about CPT codes.  Even though \nwe have not developed a policy and CPT codes to be billed like other states such as Oregon \nthat  have  doulas,  they  have  them  bill  their  Medicaid  program  based  upon  the  type  of \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 24, 2021 \nPage 35 \n \ndelivery—whether it was a vaginal delivery, vaginal that turned into a cesarean, or vaginal \nafter  a  previous  cesarean—all  those  have  different  CPT  codes.    That  would  allow  the \nMedicaid program to tie the doula to the type of birth that actually occurred.  Even though it \nwould have the same type of reimbursement, it would help tie the service provided to the \noutcome.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nMs. Lynch, will you please stay on the line?  I know you are here to provide neutral \ntestimony.  Does anyone have any questions for Ms. Lynch? \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nYou just testified that you are estimating a $1.2 million savings.  Is that based on national \ndata or are you using Nevada's data?  We already have doulas here.  Do you have any studies \ndone in the state of Nevada that would be relevant?  It sounds as though we have a significant \npopulation of doulas already who are involved in the process. \n \nAlso, do you have a fixed number that you would pay a doula?  It sounds as though if there \nwere bad outcomes, they would be paid more.  For instance, if they ended up having a \ncesarean section, are you now going to stratify that and pay them more?  I am curious about \nwhere you got your figures. \n \nErin Lynch: \nWe looked at national studies on Medicaid and applied those cost savings using Nevada \nMedicaid data.  If it said that the national studies helped reduce Medicaid costs by $1,500 per \nbirth, then we applied that to the number of births that occur in Nevada.  Also, national \nstudies say that only about 6 percent of births are attended by doulas, so we applied that type \nof percentage too, so it is like both, using national studies and then applying it to Nevada \nMedicaid data. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nMaybe you could get this out to the entire Committee:  were these studies done using a doula \nversus a coach?  Certainly, if you have a loved one, a parent, or a coach there, versus no one \nat all, but what is the end number?  How many did it really serve?  I really researched this \nissue before this testimony today trying to find some actual factual double-blind studies and \nthe end numbers.  If you have that information, I would love to see it. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nObviously,  we  put  you  on  the  spot,  but  would  you  provide  that  information  to \nAssemblywoman Titus?  Obviously, with this data collection it is premature at this time, and \nI understand that you are using some national statistics as well as trying to incorporate them.  \nIf you can get whatever you have to the Committee, that would be helpful. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 24, 2021 \nPage 36 \n \nErin Lynch: \nThere was a question about reimbursement.  The analysis we conducted was mostly based \nupon other states such as Oregon.  Oregon reimburses a bundled rate.  Their rate is $350, no \nmatter what the outcome is—whether it is a vaginal birth or a cesarean birth. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you for that.  Again, if you have any other follow-up information, I am sure it would \nbe very helpful for the Committee members to be able to review.  Do we have anyone else in \nneutral?  [There was no one.]  At this time, I will turn this back over to Assemblywoman \nSummers-Armstrong to make any closing remarks. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nThank you, Committee, I appreciate your listening attentively and asking such pointed and \ndeep questions.  I will refer all Committee members to NELIS.  There are a number of \nexhibits  from  the  March  of  Dimes  [Exhibit M],  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human \nServices  [Exhibit  N],  and  even  an  excerpt  from  the  National  Vital  Statistics  System \n[Exhibit O].  These reports paint a stark picture of maternal deaths in our great state.  This \nbill allows us to improve these statistics by focusing on moms.  When moms do better, babies \ndo better, and families do better.   \n \nI am going to conclude by sharing my screen.  Doulas and birth support people are important.  \nThis woman, Frau Busse, helped me birth two beautiful sons in a foreign land, five thousand \nmiles from my mother.  The first picture is of the two of us in 1987 when she helped me birth \nmy son Brandon.  I was just a kid.  The second picture is the two of us in 2013.  My husband \nand I took a trip to Europe and made a side trip to see Frau Busse, and that is taken in her \ngarden.  This woman loved me when I needed her to.  She cared for me when I needed \nsomeone to care for me; she wrapped me in her arms with love; she supported me.  She saw \nme.  She was a doula and she was a midwife.  I was lucky that I had her, and I am asking that \nthis Committee consider that every mother in the state of Nevada is worth it, and I hope you \nwill support this bill. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 24, 2021 \nPage 37 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you, Assemblywoman Summers-Armstrong, for your presentation.  At this time, I will \nclose the hearing on A.B. 256. \n \n[Exhibit P, Exhibit Q, Exhibit R, Exhibit S, and Exhibit T were submitted but not discussed \nand will become part of the record.]         \n \nWe will now begin public comment.

Committee rules and protocol were explained.]  I will now open the \nhearing on Assembly Bill 345. \n \nAssembly  Bill  345:    Revises  provisions  relating  to  substance  use  disorders. \n(BDR 40-978) \n \nAssemblyman David Orentlicher, Assembly District No. 20: \nAssembly District No. 20 is in Las Vegas and Henderson.  I am grateful for the opportunity \nto present Assembly Bill 345.  I am joined by experts Dr. Joanne Csete and Dr. Alex Kral, \nwho will talk about the research, and others from the community who know a lot about \nopioid abuse and how we can deal with it.   \n \nAssembly Bill 345 is designed to reduce harm and save lives in Nevada [page 1, Exhibit C].  \nI have had much help in development from Joanne Csete and from Megan Comlossy of the \nLegislative Counsel Bureau.  The seeds for this bill were planted three years ago when our \nHealth Law Program at University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) hosted a conference on \nthe opioid epidemic in Nevada and in the United States.  We invited Professor Csete to speak \nabout the experience in other countries with addressing similar problems.  When she talked \nabout overdose prevention sites, it blew me away.  The data are amazing about how effective \nthey are in preventing overdose deaths and transmission of communicable diseases.  When \nI heard that presentation, I thought we needed this in Nevada.  I am glad I can present that to \nyou today.   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 26, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nI had help from Lisa Lee, Karla Wagner, Lea Moser, and Robert Harding, who are experts \nhere in Nevada, and other members of our working group for Bill Draft Request 40-978.  \nJason Griffin also helped on this.   \n \nThis bill is designed to reduce harm from the problem of opioid use [page 2].  One definition \nof \"harm reduction\" says it \". . . is a set of practical strategies . . . aimed at reducing negative \nconsequences associated with drug use.\"  We could do harm reduction in other settings, not \nonly with drug use, but this is a common area where you can have a behavior that you cannot \ncontrol entirely.  Sometimes you do not want to control it entirely, sometimes you do.  If \ndrug use is going to exist, you at least want to minimize the harm that is caused.  This is a \nbalancing act because you want to reduce the harm, but not go too far.  Here are some \nexamples:  not driving if you plan on drinking alcohol, but having a designated driver come \nwith you; consuming nicotine in the form of gum or patches instead of smoking cigarettes—\nat least you are not doing the harm to your lungs from the cigarette smoke; distributing sterile \ninjection devices to reduce the spread of HIV or hepatitis C, which is common in the United \nStates and in Nevada.  These examples all relate to drug use, but here is another example in \nanother  setting—seat  belts  and  airbags  in  motor  vehicles.    We  hope  we  do  not  have \nautomobile accidents, but we cannot eliminate them entirely so at least we reduce the harm \nfor people who are wearing seat belts and having airbags.   \n \nThe opioid problem has been a serious one, especially during the pandemic, in the United \nStates and in Nevada.  In 2019, almost 50,000 people in the United States died from opioid-\ninvolved  overdoses  [page  3].    This  past  November,  the  National  Drug  Helpline  placed \nNevada on \"red alert\" status because of the increase in death from overdoses.  We have seen \nthis problem exacerbated by COVID-19.  Here is a chart that shows the increase in opioid \nproblems from 2019 to 2020.  It shows Nevada in dark red, which means we have seen more \nthan a 50 percent increase.  A few months ago, the American Medical Association put out \na statement,  urging  governors  and  state  legislatures  to  take  action  and  implement  harm \nreduction strategies.   \n \nThis bill has two components to save more lives [page 4].  One is to authorize an overdose \nprevention site pilot; the other is to make sure doctors are giving naloxone prescriptions to \npatients who are at higher risk for overdose.  These two together will provide more harm \nreduction from opioid abuse in Nevada.   \n \nI will turn now to my copresenters, Joanne Csete and Alex Kral, to talk about what we know \nabout overdose prevention sites.  \n \nJoanne Csete, Ph.D., M.P.H., Associate Professor, Mailman School of Public Health, \nColumbia University: \nI congratulate the Assembly for opening a discussion on this important bill.  In the mid-\n1980s, HIV linked to drug injection was exploding in western Europe [Exhibit D].  The \nSwiss, among other authorities, decided they needed to do something innovative to try to stop \nthe harm that was coming from the enormous increase they were seeing in drug-related HIV \n[page 2].  In the shadow of their own Parliament in Bern, they created a space where people \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 26, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \ncould come inject drugs with medical personnel around them.  This would ensure the people \nhad clean injection equipment, and, if there was overdose, there would be medical people to \nhelp reduce the harm of it.  Since then, these services have multiplied, as shown, in western \nand central Europe.  There are also 37 of them in Canada and 3 in Australia.  In Canada, \nthere was only one supervised consumption facility, which was open from 2003 until 2016 \nwhen Canada realized it had the same kind of dramatic increase in overdoses as we have \nexperienced in the U.S.  Those sites, then, multiplied across the country. \n \nBecause  of  these  decades  of  experience  we  have  with  this  service  and  thanks  to  the \nenterprising  work  of  many  researchers—especially  those  at  the  University  of  British \nColumbia  in  Vancouver—we  have  a  robust  body  of  evidence  to  look  at  the  outcomes \nassociated with this intervention [page 3].  Obviously, these services were created to reduce \noverdoses.  Most of them boast many thousands of overdose episodes without a single \nassociated death or brain injury.  This is because people have health help nearby.  Needle \nsharing goes down, reducing HIV transmission.  The better services have good systems of \nreferral to other kinds of health and social support.  These include, in many cases, access to \nvarious forms of treatments for drug dependence.  The service in Vancouver that has been \nwell studied has a drug treatment facility on the premises.   \n \nThe sites lead to a decrease in the unsafe disposal of syringes.  Most of these places have \nbeen able to demonstrate a decrease in open drug scenes and public disorder.  I know of no \nevidence in the peer-reviewed literature of any increase in crime in the neighborhoods where \nthese services exist, along with no increase in the initiation of drug use, which is often a fear \nexpressed.   \n \nThe last point is one that is frequently overlooked but is important to the cost-effectiveness of \nthese services.  We are looking at people who come inside these services instead of being on \nthe street where, if there is a difficulty or overdose, ambulances with emergency medical \ntechnicians will need to come and people will be taken to hospitals.  That has declined \ndramatically in places like Vancouver.  When I visited the neighborhood in question before \nthe service opened, I constantly saw ambulances going back and forth to hospitals.  Now they \ndo not need to. \n \nDespite this evidence, when the conservative government was elected in Canada in 2006, it \ndecided to close the facility in Vancouver.  That was challenged by some people who used \ndrugs.  The case went all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court, in \na unanimous decision, showed that it was very much convinced by the kind of evidence \nI have just talked about [page 4].  Without any kind of negative evidence it could see, lives \nwere being saved.  So, Insite continued and was a model for the many services that now exist \nacross Canada. \n \nI wanted to show you a picture from a visit I made to Berlin, Germany [page 5].  The \nGermans have gone beyond the first model of a stationary overdose prevention site to having \nmobile ones.  On the right, you see the inside of a supervised consumption bus.  The political \nviability of these facilities is that they now have a long history, thousands and thousands of \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 26, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \noverdose episodes with no deaths on their premises.  In Germany, as would be the case in the \nNetherlands and a number of other places we could look at, these services exist in part of a \nrange of harm reduction services [page 6].  You can see I have explained some of the drop-in \ncenters, fixed and mobile consumption spaces.  There are also first aid centers where people \nwith soft tissue infections can get those treated.  There is free HIV and hepatitis testing.  \nThere is even a place where people can bring pets.  The symbols are well known in Berlin.  \nPeople know the routes of the mobile services.  This shows a range of harm reduction \napproaches. \n \nYou know that fentanyl is the culprit in much of the overdose mortality in North America.  \nAs fentanyl markets expand their reach to Europe as well, some of the services are starting to \ndo things like testing the drugs that come into their centers for the presence of fentanyl or \nfentanyl derivatives [page 7].  As shown by the Harm Reduction Coalition in New York, \npeople can decide whether they want to take their drug, take it more slowly, or modify their \nbehavior accordingly.   \n \nIt is obvious that the European Union has never seen the level of overdose mortality we are \nnow suffering within the U.S. [page 8].  I think there are three main reasons for that.  First, \nthey are committed to investing in a broad range of overdose prevention services and other \nharm  reduction  services  that  are  supported  by  government  money,  not  just  by \nnongovernmental  organizations  (NGOs)  as  they  are  here.    They  are  sustainable  and \nconsidered to be part of primary care.  Second, with nationalized or quasi-nationalized health \nsystems, you would not see the same kind of out-of-control, unscientific, aggressive, and \ndeceptive marketing of opioid medicines that caught us up here and was in many ways an \nengine for the dramatic increase we see in the graph.  Third, and perhaps most important, in \nmost of these countries minor drug offenses and nonviolent drug offenses are decriminalized \nor people do not go to jail for them, so there is greater opportunity to steer them to a range of \nhealth and social services.   \n \nI gave you a few links to summaries of some of the research we have [page 9].  In the more \nrecent one by Armbrecht and others, you will be able to see more recent peer-reviewed \nliterature.  The second one on the list was done for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, when they \nstarted considering having a supervised injection or overdose facility.  The third is the \nevidence that went to the Canadian Supreme Court from the pilot years of the Insite facility \nin Vancouver.  \n \nAlex Kral, Ph.D., Distinguished Fellow, RTI International: \nI am an epidemiologist and have been studying drug use here in the United States since 1993.  \nIn the United States, there are about 71,000 overdose deaths, 2,400 new infections of HIV, \nand 38,000 new infections of hepatitis C per year [page 2, Exhibit E].  Infective endocarditis, \na heart disease, is also up, with about 20,000 cases a few years ago, and soft tissue infections \nare at about 500,000 a year.  The health complications associated with injection drug use in \nthe United States are quite broad.   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 26, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nIn the United States, there are no legally sanctioned overdose prevention programs [page 3].  \nThere is one unsanctioned site that we have evaluated.  It has been open for six years.  \nIt entails, much like you saw in the previous presentation, two separate rooms—one for \ninjection, one for post-injection.  They have six stainless steel tables with mirrors and a table \nfor assisted injection.  A staff person is present in the room at all times who can help to save \nsomebody or counsel them as needed.   \n \nWe published a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine last July [page 4].  It looked \nat all the overdoses at that site.  During the six years of operation, there were over 10,000 \ninjections.  Thirty-three people overdosed, and none of them died.  They were all saved by \nthe people who worked at the site.  It is also important to note there were no ambulance calls \nrequired.  That is a big issue as well because of the resources related to having an ambulance \nrespond to overdoses.   \n \nWe also did a study looking at crime in the neighborhood [page 5].  The left graph shows ten \nyears  of  data,  the  five  years  before  and  after  the  site  opened.    The  green  depicts  the \nneighborhood within 500 meters of the site; the blue on the left and the red on the right are \ncontrol  neighborhoods  in  the  same  city  that  are  similar  neighborhoods  without  a  safe \nconsumption site.  Based on police reports, crime went down after implementation of the site \nin the 500 meters around the site.  In the blue control neighborhoods, things are stable.  There \nwas good news in terms of crime around the site.   \n \nWe published a study in a peer-reviewed journal two years ago that showed if you implement \nthe same type of site they had in Vancouver in a city in the United States, it would save the \ncity $3.5 million a year.  There would be savings in overdoses; in ambulances not being used; \nand reduction in HIV, hepatitis C, abscesses, and those kinds of things.  This is why the \nAmerican Medical Association voted to approve overdose prevention programs in 2017 \n[page  6].    This  is  something  that  is  completely  sanctioned  by  the  American  Medical \nAssociation and many state medical associations.   \n \nYours is not the only state considering such a bill.  There are similar bills being deliberated in \nmany states close to Nevada [page 7].  The mayors of many cities have declared they want to \nimplement these overdose prevention sites.   \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nAs we heard, the American Medical Association and the American Public Health Association \nendorsed the concept of overdose prevention sites [page 6, Exhibit C].  Now I will go \nthrough an overview of what the bill does.  This bill would not create an overdose prevention \nprogram; it would enable pilot programs.  Washoe County and Clark County would have \nauthority to open one pilot program each.  If those go well, other counties would be given the \noption.  These could be done either in a brick-and-mortar fixed site or with a mobile site.  \nThey would be operated by the health authority, an academic institution—University of \nNevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) or University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) School of Medicine—\na nonprofit organization, or a combination of any of those three.   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 26, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nHow would these work?  They are controlled environments with on-site, trained personnel.  \nThey can connect the users to education and with referrals for treatment.  There would be \noversight by state or local health authorities to make sure these are carefully regulated. \n \nThe bill provides a number of safeguards for the community [page 7].  Before opening a pilot \nsite, the entity would have to consult with law enforcement, health authorities, and the public.  \nThey would have to ensure there was safe and proper disposal of used injection equipment.  \nOne of the virtues we have seen is that, instead of needles and syringes being left out in \nparks, on sidewalks, and in streets, they are disposed of properly in these facilities.  There \nwould be oversight by local health authorities, county commissions, and the State Board of \nHealth. \n \nThere are safeguards for the participants [page 8].  These will be staffed by trained personnel.  \nThere  will  be  distribution  of  sterile  needles  and  syringes  so  users  are  not  transmitting \ncommunicable diseases.  Participants will be monitored in the treatment and posttreatment \nrooms.  First aid will be administered on-site if it is necessary.  There will be consultation \nand referral for treatment for mental health conditions or substance use disorders.  Sections 9 \nand 10 have confidentiality provisions for the participants and protection from any legal \nconsequences for both participants and the staff at the program.   \n \nThis legislation would enable pilot sites, one each in Washoe and Clark Counties, for four \nyears [page 9].  After two years, if the preliminary review indicates that things are going \nwell, as we would expect, based on the data from other countries and the unsanctioned site in \nthe United States, it would be possible for the Board of Health to authorize pilot programs \nin other counties.  They would review the number of participants, see whether there were \noverdoses, and see if there were referrals, to gauge how they are operating.  After four years \nfor any pilot site, there would be a formal review to decide if they could transition to \na permanent site.  If it all went well in Washoe and Clark Counties after one year, they could \nbe authorized to expand beyond the one site.  That is the main part of the bill.   \n \nThe second part of the bill is in section 12 that deals with another harm reduction policy, \nnaloxone coprescribing [page 10].  People who are being prescribed opioids and are at risk \nfor overdoses would be prescribed naloxone along with the opioid prescription, so the patient \ncan have naloxone on hand in case of an overdose.  Ten states have legislation or regulations \non this.  Eight states require the prescription be provided; two states require the prescription \nbe offered.  What we see in those states is it leads to increases in pharmacy dispensing of \nnaloxone.  We do not have enough data yet to know if that method of expanding access to \nnaloxone compares with programs like we have in Nevada for nonpharmacy community \ndistribution of naloxone.   \n \nThe provisions in A.B. 345 are modeled after Rhode Island regulations.  What we brought \nin from the Rhode Island regulations is that if a physician is prescribing for patients at \na higher risk for opioid overdose, the physician would provide a naloxone prescription.  \nThe categories of patients who would be considered higher risk are these:  if they are taking \nmore than 50 morphine milligram equivalents per day, if they are taking an opioid and \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 26, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \na benzodiazepine, or if they have a history of opioid overdose or opioid use disorder.  In our \nconceptual amendment,  we  removed  previous  section  12,  subsection  3,  and  section  12, \nsubsection 4 [Exhibit F].  There is a new section 12.3 to clean up some problems we had with \nthe original language.  If you are looking at the people who would get this prescription, it is \nimportant to be looking at the conceptual amendment.  It seemed like Rhode Island had \na good model, but the data are not as clear as with the overdose prevention site, so we \nwelcome suggestions on refining the criteria.  We might be leaving some people out that \nshould be in; there may be some people in who do not need to be.   \n \nI would like to thank Natalie Johns and Areli Alarcon from my office for their excellent help \nin preparing this presentation.  If you would like to cosponsor this bill, I would be happy to \nadd you on by an amendment.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThere are quite a few questions from members regarding this policy conversation about your \nbill. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank you, Assemblyman Orentlicher, for bringing up this discussion and this bill.  I think it \nis a good policy discussion to have.  I am glad you mentioned section 12.  That was one of \nthe first things I was going to bring up, especially section 12, subsection 3, where you \ndescribe not being able to prescribe Narcan or a reversal drug or opioids if the patient is \nbeing prescribed benzodiazepine.  I know you are not a practitioner, but as a practitioner \nI would say it would be important the practitioners themselves make that decision.  I am \nanxious to see what that looks like in your amendment.  I will follow up with my questions \non that once I see the amendment. \n \nThe  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  (CDC)  recently  released  a  graph  on \noverdoses.  We know the opioid epidemic came in three waves.  In 1999, the prescription \nopioid overdoses became a problem.  In 2010, it was the heroin overdoses.  The third wave \nwas fentanyl overdoses.  Over the last several sessions, we have successfully tried to curb \nthat.  We were an early state to adopt Narcan prescriptions and allow Narcan to be dispensed \nto family members.  Providers like me who prescribe these are accountable for how they do \nthis.  We have also entertained needle exchange programs.  I am curious to know how many \nstates actually passed this legislation.  Do we have the number? \n \nAlex Kral: \nNo states have passed this legislation.  A bill passed through both health committees and \npublic safety committees in other states, but none of the bills has passed so far.   \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThe first program started in the 1980s in Switzerland, so this is not a new idea.  I graduated \nfrom medical school in 1981; we were dealing with the HIV epidemic, including issues about \nneedle sharing.  Since that time, we have progressed in thinking about not sharing needles.  \nI am  curious  about  statistics  on  the  drugs.    Who  supplies  the  drugs?    What  drugs  are \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 26, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nparticipants allowed to use?  Do they bring in their own?  Is this a volunteer program?  Who \ncontrols the dose of heroin?  Do participants tell those at the center how much they plan to \ntake?  Who controls the actual process, and where do the drugs come from? \n \nJoanne Csete: \nDr. Kral, did you want to talk about the site you studied? \n \nAlex Kral: \nThere are no drugs provided at the site, so people must bring and use their own drugs.  They \nwill typically let the attendant know what type of drug they are using.  That is essentially it.  \nThey are then free to use as much or as little of those drugs as they want to use.  If they use \ntoo much and overdose, the attendants are there to help save them.  There are no drugs given \nout at the site; they are pre-obtained.   \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nYou bring in your own drugs, such as heroin, which is still illegal under federal and state law.  \nWhat is the role of government in this?  Conceptually, it is nice to be in a safe area.  I know \nthere is no increased crime in the area, and overdoses are prevented.  Do you see folks \ncoming in just to push the envelope?  They can get a new supply of their heroin, not know \nhow strong it is, go to a safe site to inject it, get their high, and know they are safe if they \noverdose.  Is this more enabling than preventative? \n \nAlex Kral: \nThe number of overdoses at these sites is actually lower than the rate of overdose in the \ncommunity.  That indicates to us that people are not taking more risks in these environments \nthan they are out in the community. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nYou said there has been a decrease in number of deaths in the area around these sites because \nNarcan is available.  Was the Narcan already available in these areas?  In Nevada, Narcan is \navailable.  Is that a unique situation? \n \nAlex Kral: \nThe difference here is that, if you use drugs while you are alone, you can have all the \nnaloxone you want, but you cannot use it on yourself because you have overdosed.  The point \nof these sites is to ensure there is someone there, a professional who knows how to use the \nnaloxone or oxygen they have available.  That is the main intervention—to make sure there is \nsomebody there in case of overdose. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI would like to bring this back to the state of Nevada.  The studies we have seen show a \nlowered rate of overdose except for during this pandemic, which is the outlier.  We have seen \nan increase in overdoses in this last year.  It is a significant tragedy.  Do you know how many \nNevada overdoses have been from heroin or from other injectable drugs? \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 26, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nI do not have that information.  We have some Nevada experts on the call who may know.  \nLet us bear in mind that we get recurring waves.  This is not an outlier.  The waves seem to \nbe inevitable.  The extent of data we have is impressive.  There is no reason to think that \nNevada would be any different from what we have seen in the all these other locations that \nhave benefitted from these sites. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nWould the use of these sites be restricted to Nevada residents?  Would you have to show an \nID, a health insurance card, or some sort of health care information in case there is an \noverdose, the overdose had to be reversed, and the person needed to be hospitalized?  How \nmuch information gathering will be required? \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nWe had not thought about that.  I would be happy to talk to you about it to see if that should \nbe part of the legislation.  I would be interested in hearing whether it is an issue for the \nunsanctioned site. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nMy concern is if medical care is sought after an overdose.  Do participants have to sign a \nwaiver at the door?  How do we, as health care providers, take care of them if they need \ncare?    Having  worked  thousands  of  hours  in  emergency  rooms  and  having  dealt  with \noverdoses, I am curious about how the process would work and how it would affect those \nproviding  care  these  folks  might  need.    I  have  other  questions  but  can  reach  out  to \nAssemblyman Orentlicher off-line.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI see Ms. Lisa Lee is on the line.  She may have Nevada-specific data. \n \nLisa Lee, Private Citizen, Reno, Nevada: \nData is slow to catch up to us.  The most current data on the opioid dashboard is from 2019.  \nPre-pandemic data in Nevada show about 400 people have fatal overdoses each year.  A good \nshare of those are due to polysubstance use of opioids and a benzodiazepine, which is \nimportant to note with the coprescribing of naloxone in section 12.  I asked the medical \nexaminer in Washoe County for the quarterly report.  I try to stay on top of that because I do \noutreach with people who use drugs, so I want to make sure that I can warn people if there is \na bad batch.  I have fentanyl test strips that I will be taking out when doing outreach and data \ncollection in northern Nevada.  In addition, I wanted to say that there is data collection \nplanned.  We are going through the IRB [institutional review board] process currently with \nDr. Karla Wagner.  The study will be collecting data with people who use drugs to talk about \nwhat is happening on the ground as well as acceptability of the overdose prevention sites \ngoing forward.   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 26, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIf there is additional information, please provide it to Assemblyman Orentlicher.  He can get \nit to Committee staff for distribution.  \n \nAssemblyman Hafen: \nI have several questions but will touch on two different sections of the bill.  Section 9 refers \nto the confidential nature of the information being collected.  Do you think that language will \nstand up to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request?  Do you think the information \nwill not be released to individuals who request it? \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nI will check to make sure. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIt looks as if Ms. Lee would like to respond. \n \nLisa Lee: \nRobert Harding is on the call.  He can answer that question. \n \nRobert Harding, Private Citizen, Reno, Nevada: \nThe language used for section 9 is pulled from previous legislation that authorized the \nsyringe access programs in 2013.  There have not been any challenges with those records \nsince then, so I do not foresee any problems using it in the future.  \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you, Mr. Harding.  Are there any follow-up questions? \n \nAssemblyman Hafen: \nMy concern is these actions are still considered criminal.  I would not want the information \nto be released.  I had a question about section 7, subsection 1.  It states that these sites will be \noperated  by  a  health  authority,  higher  education,  a  nonprofit  organization,  or  any \ncombination thereof.  It does not seem to be specific to Nevada higher education or Nevada \nhealth authorities.  Is this limited to the Nevada System of Higher Education and Nevada \nhealth authorities?  If so, have they provided any feedback? \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nOur assumption was they would be.  I have had conversations with people at UNLV School \nof Medicine.  The person I spoke with said they would be interested in participating in a \nproject like this.  Our intent was Nevada entities would operate the program. \n \nLisa Lee: \nWe currently have a large stakeholder group that includes people from the Southern Nevada \nHealth District, the Washoe County Health District, and the Office of the County Manager \nfor Washoe County.  It also includes associate professors from UNR.  We are in constant \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 26, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nconversations about these issues.  It all depends on what happens with A.B. 345 going \nforward, but they all are voices at the table in this larger stakeholder group. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nIn  this  Committee,  we  have  talked  quite  a  bit  about  the  societal  stigmas  attached  to \nbehavioral and mental health and the impact that has on access to treatment, the type of \ntreatment you can receive, and the burden of carrying those issues in your life.  Would you \ntalk about how this plan works to destigmatize mental and behavioral health related to \naddiction and other issues? \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI see that one of the people on the line to answer questions has his hand raised.  I will go to \nhim. \n \nTick Segerblom, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \nI was trying to reply to the previous question.  Clark County is eager to go forward with this \nprogram.  I have served on the Southern Nevada Health District Board and the Clark County \nCommission.  There are places in my district that are ready to go.  All we need is a little help.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe have someone else who can answer Assemblywoman Peters' question. \n \nJoanne Csete: \nThere is a lot of qualitative literature about these places.  If you talk to people who use drugs \nand these facilities, they often say those are the only places where they have been able to get \nnonjudgmental care.  For many, it is also the only way to integrate them into any other kind \nof health or social service system.  These are often the door people will go through when they \ndo not want to go elsewhere because they fear stigma, judgment, and discrimination.  The \nbest of these facilities have served to be places where people can feel that they do what they \nneed to do without being stigmatized and judged.   \n \nLisa Lee: \nI am a woman in long-term recovery from opioid use disorder.  While I have not had the \nprivilege of using one of these overdose prevention sites, I can safely say I probably would \nnot have lived with hepatitis C for 21 years if these sites had existed.  I can safely say that \nmany of my friends would still be alive at this point.  Stigma is a real thing that ends in \npeople not getting care they need.  I can tell you that, because of stigma, I did not go for \nmedical care and lanced my own abscesses while experiencing homelessness and being an \ninjection drug user.  I constantly endangered my life.  There are people around us with \nnecrotizing fasciitis and whatnot that are a direct result of prohibitive policies and keeping \npeople who use drugs in the shadows and without care.  I think spaces like this are deeply \nmeaningful.   \n \nThe opioid crisis has been in the American mass purview for a limited time, but I have been \nhaving an opioid crisis for decades.  I think of places like this, and I know that a lot of people \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 26, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nwould still be here, a lot of people would not live with stigmatizing blood-borne infections, \nthere would be limitations of soft tissue infections left untreated that end up turning septic or \ngo into endocarditis.  Stigma is a real thing that kills people.  I am glad you brought that up. \n \nRobert Harding: \nTo reinforce what was just said, there are two forms of stigma.  There is external stigma—the \nstigmas placed on a person.  There is also internal stigma, which is when we take those \nstigmas and start to feel them deeply within our souls and think of them as a person.  Having \nharm reduction services that support people who use drugs and providing that space and that \nenvironment helps break down and change the internal stigma, which can be just as deadly as \nthe external. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nMembers, if you have questions, please send me a message so I can get you in the queue.  \nWe need to get to testimony in support, opposition, and neutral for this bill, and we have one \nmore bill to hear. \n \nI am excited you have so much data to analyze; unfortunately, it is from outside the United \nStates, from countries with different health care systems and different public health care \nsystems, and they have had prolonged education campaigns to destigmatize this.  How do \nyou take some of that data and have it play into the success we might have in our health care \nmodel? \n \nJoanne Csete:  \nOf course, the history is different with the nationalized or quasi-nationalized health systems \nmaking an enormous difference.  The criminal law is different.  I think, however, that the \nactual interventions that go with these services or that could be linked to an overdose \nprevention site have a certain universality from which we can extrapolate from the decades of \nexperience that is already out there, because overdoses suffered in Europe are not different \nfrom the ones here.  The other data that is very useful is the cost data.  There have been some \ngood costing studies.  It is rare to get good costing of any kind of intervention that deals with \nmarginalized populations there.  I think the data could be very useful for policy makers here. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nA  majority  of  the  countries  that  have  these  types  of  programs  available  have  also \ndecriminalized drug possession.  How does that work here?  This is still a felony charge in \nNevada.  How does that work in this legislation?  I would not want to see facilities set up, \nand police officers are waiting outside to arrest people going in or out. \n \nJoanne Csete: \nCanadian controlled substance laws are similar to ours.  The sites there operate on an \nexception  to  the  Controlled  Drugs  and  Substances  Act  that  enables  people  to  not  be \nprosecuted for what goes on in the facilities.  It is a matter of community liaison work to be \nsure the police are not standing outside to arrest people as soon as they come out.  That is not \nhappening in places where possession has been decriminalized.  Basically, there has to be an \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 26, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nexception to whatever drug control laws there are.  Even in western Europe, excluding \nPortugal and a few other places, there has been a longer history of decriminalization but the \ndrugs  are  still  illegal.    The  law  allows  for  an  exception  to  the  drug  control  criminal \nframework. \n \nAlex Kral: \nThe  only  country  that  decriminalized  drugs  is  Portugal.    None  of  the  others  have \ndecriminalized drugs.  Norway is about to, but that does not span the data we have from the \npast few years in Norway.  It is much like syringe exchange programs.  You need public \nsafety and public health to work hand-in-hand for these programs to work.  We have been \ndoing syringe access successfully in many states in the United States for decades now.  I do \nnot see a reason why you could not also do that with respect to this particular intervention. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI have some concerns in addition to the question that was asked by Assemblyman Hafen.  \nI would not want people to be able to do a FOIA request to get the names and addresses of \npeople in the sites and then use that information to further criminalize people who are trying \nto get help.  I do not remember seeing that in the language of the bill, but I think it should \nprobably be considered as part of the legislation. \n \nAssemblyman Hafen: \nIn the bill language I do not see any age limitation on this program.  It does not preclude \nminors.  The Legislative Counsel's Digest implies there is an age restriction—that a person \nmust be at least 18 years old or older.  What was your intent?   \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nI would have to think about that.  I invite our other presenters to share thoughts about \ndrawing age distinctions. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI will ask Mr. Harding to answer the question so we can move on. \n \nRobert Harding: \nI would encourage the Committee to be cautious about requiring IDs or documents.  People \nliving on the streets and living without shelter often end up without those.  This program \nwould be most beneficial to those individuals because they do not have clean, sterile spaces \nto use their supply of drugs.  Requiring they have some sort of ID or documentation when \nthey come in creates a big barrier.  I want to reinforce that the language I brought in section 9 \nfrom the syringe services program addressed the anonymity of the program to protect the \nclients from any FOIA requests and to keep that barrier low.  \n \nChair Nguyen: \nMs. Lee, did you have a response to the juvenile question? \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 26, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nLisa Lee: \nI believe when we put together the original draft language our intention was these would be \nfor people aged 18 years and older. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo other countries with programs like this have age limits, or do they target adults? \n \nJoanne Csete: \nIn some of the facilities, the staff is trained to refer people under age 18 to other kinds of \nservices, but some of them require no proof of age or any identity documents.  The ones in \nDenmark have been widely visited.  People who used drugs were part of the design from the \nbeginning.  They serve everyone; they do not try to distinguish by age. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI appreciate your presentation.  There are lots of questions and lots of comments.  We could \nprobably be here all day discussing this.  I would encourage members to reach out to \nAssemblyman Orentlicher.  I am sure he would be happy and willing to provide contact \ninformation for some of the presenters.  I will open testimony in support, opposition, and \nneutral of Assembly Bill 345.   \n \nTick Segerblom: \nI am not appearing on behalf of the County Commission or the Clark County Board of \nHealth.  This bill is fantastic and greatly needed.  As you know, the war on drugs is over; we \nlost.  Oregon just decriminalized all drugs.  I think that is the way the nation is headed.  Now \nwe have to deal with the issue of how to make sure the people who use drugs do not kill \nthemselves and provide services so, hopefully, they can get off of them.  My district includes \nthe Flamingo Wash which runs next to UNLV.  There are huge numbers of drug users in that \nWash.    They  come  out  of  the  Wash  and  into  the  neighborhoods.    There  are  syringes \neverywhere.  We have started a syringe exchange program.  The next step will be this, where \npeople can come to a secure facility.  \n \nWith respect to drugs being illegal, I will remind you that possession of marijuana is a C \nfelony under federal law.  You will be dealing with bills about places you can go to smoke \nmarijuana.  If you can go smoke marijuana, I do not see why you could not also go to a place, \nbring your fentanyl or whatever you have, and use that at a site.  I do not want to oppose the \nbill, but I think one site in Las Vegas is not enough.  I would say, have the pilot programs, \nbut do not limit the number. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI would encourage you to continue to work with the bill's sponsor about any concerns you \nhave regarding the current language of the bill.  We can begin testimony in support of the \nbill. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 26, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nJim Hoffman, Member, Legislative Committee, Nevada Attorneys for Criminal Justice:  \nNevada  Attorneys  for Criminal  Justice  (NACJ)  supports A.B.  345.    Chair  Nguyen  had  \na question about FOIA requests and criminalization.  As I read the bill, section 10 states that \na person cannot be prosecuted, arrested, charged, et cetera, for either working at the place or \nfor consuming or possessing drugs in connection with it.  There is a basic level of protection \nthere.   \n \nStudies have shown that safe injection sites reduce the amount of outdoor drug use, prevent \noverdoses  and  transmission  of  disease,  and  provide  wraparound  access  to  addiction \ncounseling.  Nevada has spent the past 40 years trying mass incarceration as a response to \ndrug use.  That strategy has failed to stop drug use or the harm it poses to society.  Safe \ninjection sites would be a new tool to address the harm in a beneficial way.  For that reason, \nthe NACJ supports the bill.   \n \nErika Minaberry, Private Citizen, Reno, Nevada: \nI am privileged to have been in recovery for the last 15 years, but 15 years ago I almost died \nfrom an infection that was left untreated.  I consider myself lucky because a lot of my friends \ndid not make it to that point; they were never given the opportunity to recover, and they had \nvery brilliant brains.  If they were able to recover, they would have been able to do amazing \nthings for this community.  I believe by passing this bill, lives will be saved, and the \ncommunity will be enriched. \n \nDanielle Barrineau, Private Citizen, Reno, Nevada:  \nI wanted to talk a little bit about my past.  At the beginning of my drug use, I was kidnapped \nand sold for sex.  If that girl had known about a place like an overdose prevention site, how \namazing it would have been.  I cannot tell you how many times I tried to escape, and my \nkidnapper would find me and beat me and torture me.  I really did not have a way out.  I did \nnot know what to do.  If there was a place where I could go use safely, with all the resources \nthat are available for human sex trafficking victims, how soon could I have been saved?  \nHow much less trauma would I have had to suffer if not for a place like that?  On top of all \nthe facts that have been presented, I wanted to say that for girls who are suffering out there—\nwho cannot speak, do not know where to go, and cannot tell the truth to their pimp or sex \ntrafficker about going to use and get some syringes—this is a great option, and it should be \nsupported. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you for sharing your story. \n \nDarcy Patterson, Private Citizen, Reno, Nevada: \nI  am  grateful  for  this  opportunity  to  share  my  support  for  A.B.  345.    My  daughter  \nKirsten Yamaoka died from a heroin overdose here in Reno, Nevada.  She was 21, and it was \nher birthday.  Personally, and as an advocate, there are several reasons I support this bill.  \nWith the creation of programs for the prevention of overdoses and disease, those with \nsubstance use disorder can come to a nonbiased place that will prevent their admission to our \nhospitals for infection, overdose, and transmission of diseases such as hepatitis C and HIV.  \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 26, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nThe ability to administer opioid antagonists such as Narcan can mean another life saved.  If a \nperson who has substance use disorder does not remain alive, there is no hope for recovery.  \nThis seems elementary, but it is a huge part of how we can guide those to treatment and give \neducation regarding substance use disorder.   \n \nIn Nevada, we have at least one death from overdose every day.  Let us create programs in \nour community that foster harm reduction and reduce the stigma of substance use disorder, \nand create and provide a safe place to use substances, with policies put in place for the safety \nof those who have substance use disorder and the staff of such programs.  If this bill had been \nenacted years prior, there would have been a possibility that my daughter would have been in \nthe presence of someone who legally could have reversed her overdose, therefore saving her \nlife,  finding  treatment,  living  recovery,  and  becoming  a  contributing  member  of  our \ncommunity.  Please support A.B. 345.   \n \nHolly Welborn, Policy Director, American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada: \nI am testifying in support of A.B. 345.  Among the most disastrous costs of the failed war on \ndrugs  are  its  detrimental  consequences  for  public  health.    Assemblyman  Orentlicher  is \njoining the chorus of lawmakers who are moving the state away from the criminalization \npolicies that destroy our communities and people's lives.  Assembly Bill 345 is the right \nsolution to this crisis.  Prevention sites offer the promise of reduced overdose fatalities, \nincrease access to health services, and promote overall benefit to public safety.  We thank \nAssemblyman  Orentlicher  for  bringing  this  legislation  and  encourage  the  Committee's \nsupport.  \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you.  We can go to our next caller in support.  [There was no one.]  We will go to \ncallers in opposition to this bill.  [There were none.]  Are there callers in neutral? \n \nBradley Mayer, representing Southern Nevada Health District: \nSouthern Nevada Health District has been at the table as this bill was being crafted.  For the \npurposes of providing information and context, I have some things to share.  The rate of drug \noverdoses is increasing in Clark County.  It has risen from 19.2 per 100,000 people in 2011 \nto 21.2 per 100,000 in 2020.  Most of those overdoses were unintentional.  The primary \ndriver can be attributed to the increasing presence of fentanyl in the drug supply.  Fentanyl \noverdoses are concentrated more in a younger population, with an average age of 29 years \nold versus 49 years old for overdoses not involving fentanyl.  In addition to the overdose \nissue, Nevada received a determination of need from the CDC in 2017 that found the state \nwas at risk for significant increases in hepatitis and HIV infections from intravenous drug \nuse.  Around the world, these overdose prevention sites have evolved as a harm reduction \nstrategy, one of several responses designed to address public health concerns associated with \nillicit drug use.  As far as we understand it, no one has died at an overdose prevention site.  \nStudies have been done in other countries that found that the presence of these sites has been \nassociated with decreases in infectious diseases over time—such as in Spain, where new HIV \ninfections were cut in half and in Canada where I suggest that overdose prevention sites \nprevent about 80 new HIV cases annually.  Vancouver, British Columbia, operates one of \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 26, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nthese sites.  At that site between 2003 and 2006, 46 percent of participants entered a drug \ntreatment  program.    It  is  important  to  acknowledge  there  are  currently  no  sanctioned \noverdose prevention sites operating in the United States.  As it pertains to the provisions of \nthis bill that involve or relate to the Southern Nevada Health District, we do not have any \nissues with how this bill is currently written. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIs there anyone else in neutral?  [There was no one.]  At this time, I will turn this over for \nclosing remarks. \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nThank you, Chair, and all my copresenters.  As you heard, we have an opportunity to \nimplement a well-tested, well-vetted intervention that will reduce harm, save lives, and bring \nmarginalized people back to our community to the services they need.  There are a lot of \nproposed interventions that we hope will work.  We do not have much data, but it is hard to \nimagine having more data than we have to support this.  The fact that the American Medical \nAssociation, the American Public Health Association, and other expert organizations have \nendorsed this should make us confident that this is the right thing to do.   \n \nThank you for the hearing and the suggestions.  We will continue to work to ensure we get \neverything right.  Please let me know about other ways we can improve the bill. \n \n[Exhibit G, Exhibit H, and Exhibit I were submitted but not discussed.] \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI will close the hearing on Assembly Bill 345 and open the hearing on Assembly Bill 260.   \n \nAssembly Bill 260:  Provides for the confidentiality of contact tracing information. \n(BDR 40-747) \n \nAssemblyman Glen Leavitt, Assembly District No. 23: \nAssembly District No. 23 is in the southern part of Clark County.  I am here to present \nAssembly Bill 260 for your consideration.  All of you know that since June 2020, contact \ntracing has been an important strategy for slowing the spread of COVID-19.  On June 1, \n2020,  Governor  Steve  Sisolak  released  the  Nevada  COVID-19  Disease  Outbreak \nManagement Strategy and Concept of Operations in coordination with the Department of \nPublic  Safety,  the  Nevada  National  Guard,  and  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human \nServices.    This  Concept  of  Operations  identified  contact  tracing  as  a  key  strategy  for \npreventing the further spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19.   \n \nIt is not clear that the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy \nrules  apply  to  groups  conducting  contact  tracing.    Iliana  Peters,  former  Acting  Deputy \nDirector for HIPAA at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil \nRights,  said  in  August  that  certain  entities  conducting  contact  tracing  are  not currently \nrequired to maintain confidentiality.  There was and still is a recognition by Nevada public \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 26, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nhealth departments of the need to protect the privacy of those diagnosed with COVID-19, \nsaying the individuals who were at risk [unintelligible] not be told the identity of the patient \nwho may be exposed to them.  I applaud these efforts to maintain patient privacy at a time \nwhen the public health is of utmost importance; however, we can certainly do more to ensure \nthese attempts are successful, including codifying into law specific provisions that protect \npatient privacy as it relates to contact tracing. \n \nSections 2 through 4 of the bill define contact tracing and COVID-19.  Section 5 prohibits a \ngovernment entity or persons from disclosing information obtained through contact tracing.  \nIt also prohibits a law enforcement agency from conducting contact tracing and prohibits a \ncourt from disclosing information related to contact tracing from a government entity or \nperson.  Additionally, no later than 30 days, a person who conducts contact tracing on behalf \nof a government entity must delete, dispose of, or remove such information.  Section 6 \nauthorizes  that  a  government  entity  that  conducts  contact  tracing  may  disclose  the \ninformation if a person gives consent, the information is needed to conduct the contact \ntracing, the information is needed to save a person's life, the information is needed to protect \nthe public health, the information is needed for an investigation after a person has given \nconsent, or the information is highly material to an investigation.  It also allows for a \nrepresentative to consent on behalf of a person for a minor or a person who lacks the capacity \nto provide informed consent.  Lastly, it requires a government entity to keep a written record \nof that disclosure. \n \nSection 7 requires government agencies that may disclose information may not include \npersonally identifiable information.  Section 8 requires the Board of Health to establish \nregulations to protect the confidentiality of information obtained by individuals.  Section 9 \nauthorizes the Division of Public and Behavioral Health within the Department of Health and \nHuman Services (DHHS) to conduct investigations of alleged violations.   \n \nThat  was  the  initial  bill.    We  have  received  some  friendly  conceptual  amendments \n[Exhibit J].    The  DHHS  inquired  about  the  30-day  limit  for  keeping  data  as  they  are \nmandated to keep their data for one year.  In section 5, subsection 5, the period of 30 days \nwill be amended to one year.  They also want to be able to do a further investigation of \ncontact tracing for those held in jail or prison.  Section 5, subsection 2, will be amended to \nallow law enforcement to conduct contact tracing when the individual is currently being held \nin jail or prison. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any questions from members? \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nI am confused about how this differs from what is already occurring for contact tracing.  \nWould you please talk about the need for this in the long term, rather than having it be driven \nby policy? \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 26, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nAssemblyman Leavitt: \nIt is difficult to answer that question because everything is unknown with COVID-19.  We \nhope everything will be under control, and we will not have to worry about it in the future.  \nWe hope, but we do not know.  Putting protections in place now is a step forward in what we \nare doing even though we are remedying the situation as it currently exists.  The reason for \nthe bill is contact tracing does not currently fall under HIPAA.  That is the need for this issue.  \nIt did not come about because of the newness of COVID-19. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nMy other question has to do with limiting this bill to COVID-19.  Would it make sense to \nexpand  this  to  other  pandemic-style  scenarios  in  case  we  have  something  like  another \noutbreak? \n \nAssemblyman Leavitt: \nI am happy to look into that and expand this beyond just COVID-19 for other diseases that \ndo not currently fall under HIPAA.  The goal of the bill is so we do not have people being \narrested or forced to stay in their houses because of information regarding their current \nCOVID-19 status.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any other questions?  [There were none.]  Is there anyone on the line in support?  \n[There was no one.]  Is there anyone in opposition? \n \nBradley Mayer, representing Southern Nevada Health District: \nWe met with Assemblyman Leavitt and appreciate the intent of what he is trying to bring \nforth.  We do not want to be in a place where we are opposing this bill and hope to work with \nhim to address some of our concerns.  As you will hear from my colleague in Washoe \nCounty, there are some issues about the time limits for holding data, beginning with section \n5,  subsection  4.    They  would  jeopardize  current  funding  streams  that  have  specific \nrequirements that must be met regarding this data.  Also, it disrupts the accepted framework \nfor conducting case investigations and contact tracing. \n \nAs Assemblyman Leavitt mentioned, we also have the issue of section 5, subsection 2, \nasking that provision be deleted, as currently law enforcement does contact tracing among \ninmates.  We agree on that, but we need to work with Assemblyman Leavitt on the timelines \nthat exist so something is workable for the health districts relating to those issues.  We \nsupport the general concept of what is trying to be accomplished here, we just need to do \nsome more work.   \n \nChuck  Callaway,  Police  Director,  Office  of  Intergovernmental  Services,  Las  Vegas \nMetropolitan Police Department: \nGenerally, we are in support of the bill.  We share the same concern that was voiced by the \nprevious caller about section 5, subsection 2.  We believe that needs to be clarified.  Our \nagency does contact tracing on employees.  If we had an officer who was involved in training \nor was in a briefing and had COVID-19, we have an obligation as an employer to ensure that \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 26, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nother workers were not infected.  That involves our risk management section doing contact \ntracing among our employees.  As was stated, there could be issues with the Clark County \nDetention  Center  and  the  inmate  population  with  contact  tracing.    We  would  like  the \nopportunity to have that section clarified. \n \nJoelle Gutman Dodson, Government Affairs Liaison, Washoe County Health District: \nI wanted to thank the bill's sponsor for working with us.  We are almost there.  I appreciate \nthe proposed amendments; however, we still have a problem with section 5, subsection 5, \nwhere it limits the storage of data for one year.  I know it sounds interesting that our \nrequirements are different than DHHS's, but we have to store data longer for research and \nmeasurements that we send to the Centers for Disease Control and other places for funding \nmechanisms.  Without changing that time limitation, we could be subject to losing funds.  \nWe have about $25 million in funding streams now through 2023 for contact investigation.  \nI think we can get there on this bill. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nMay we go to our next caller in opposition?  [There was no one.]  Do we have any callers in \nneutral? \n \nLindsey Kinsinger, Manager, Office of Public Health Investigations and Epidemiology, \nDivision  of  Public  and  Behavioral  Health,  Department  of  Health  and  Human \nServices: \nWe are testifying in neutral.  As some of the counties expressed, we would welcome the \nopportunity to work with Assemblyman Leavitt to provide more clarity.  Right now, we do \ntreat contact tracing and disease investigation data and information for COVID-19 with \nHIPAA protections.  I will assure you that information is not being given out unless there is a \nsubpoena or law enforcement is involved.  We will work with you.  We support the idea of \nthe bill and would look forward to helping you rewrite the data policy. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIs there anyone else in neutral?  [There was no one.]  I will turn this back over to you, \nAssemblyman Leavitt, for any closing statements. \n \nAssemblyman Leavitt: \nIt looks as if we are making progress on this.  I apologize that I did not get the amendments \nexactly right.  We are still working on them.  I will get those to the Committee.  I do not \nthink any of the issues proposed would be too difficult to overcome.  I will continue to work \nwith the Southern Nevada Health District, Washoe County Health District, and the other \nstakeholders who voiced concerns to get the language right so we can move this from being a \ngreat concept to being a great bill.  This concludes my presentation.  I believe this is an \nimportant piece of legislation to keep individuals' information private.  I will continue to \nwork with the stakeholders to ensure we find common ground.  The working product we pass \nto the Committee in the future will be solid. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 26, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI will close the hearing on Assembly Bill 260.  We will move to public comment.  Do we \nhave anyone on the line in public comment?  [There was no one.]  Are there any comments \nfrom members?  [There were none.]  We will have a busy next couple of weeks.  We have \nquite a few bills that have come in these last few weeks.  Plan on being here on Monday, \nWednesday, and Friday.  We might have another evening meeting if we need to schedule \nthat to hear these bills before the deadline for first committee passage.

(BDR 38-919) \n \nAssemblywoman Rochelle T. Nguyen, Assembly District No. 10: \nI am here to present Assembly Bill 358, which improves access to Medicaid for people who \nare recently released from prison.  I had submitted a Committee on Health and Human \nServices bill that did the same thing when I saw that Speaker Frierson had also submitted this \nbill,  so  we  were  thinking  alike.    With  me  today  is  Richard  Whitley,  Director  of  the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services; Suzanne Bierman, Administrator of the Division \nof  Health  Care  Financing  and  Policy;  and  Robert  Thompson,  Deputy  Administrator  of \nProgram and Field Services for the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 29, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nI want to give you some information about the intent of A.B. 358.  It is to improve care \ntransitions to the community for incarcerated individuals who are eligible for Medicaid.  Let \nme give you some background.  Individuals who are incarcerated often have significant \nphysical and mental health care needs.  For example, they may experience chronic and \ninfectious diseases such as hepatitis C, and they may suffer from severe mental health and \nsubstance use disorders and other physical health issues associated with mental health and \nsubstance  use  disorders.    And  they  occur  at  a  much  higher  rate  than  in  our  general \npopulation.  The COVID-19 pandemic showed us how vulnerable many of these individuals \nare, and many suffered from this horrible disease while incarcerated when we had severe \noutbreaks in our prisons. \n \nWe want to improve health care for individuals who are recently released from prison.  This \naction in this bill will help improve health in our communities, lower spending of state health \ncare, and potentially advance public safety goals such as successful reentry and reduced \nrecidivism.  Currently, we have many individuals in our criminal justice system who qualify \nfor Medicaid, especially since Nevada expanded eligibility for low-income adults through the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act.  Medicaid has a key role in providing support to \nthese individuals, and as you know, people who are incarcerated are often disproportionately \npoor and people of color.  This bill also helps address some of those health care inequities \nwhile advancing health care and racial equity in our state. \n \nAs of 2019, 43 states—so we would be asking to join those 43 states—already have a policy \nor have enacted policies that suspend Medicaid eligibility for an individual person while in \nprison, and 42 states had a policy to suspend eligibility for an eligible person while in jail.  \nSix additional states are considering this policy, including us here today with A.B. 358.  This \nbill provides that same policy to suspend Medicaid while someone is incarcerated, rather than \nterminate them from Medicaid when they are sent to prison.   \n \nSection 1 of the bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to suspend, \nrather  than  terminate,  Medicaid  eligibility  of  an  individual  who  is  incarcerated.    If  an \nindividual is not eligible for Medicaid, or if eligibility was terminated prior to incarceration, \nhe or she can apply for Medicaid up to half a year before his or her scheduled release date.  \nI am sure my copresenters will talk about the cost savings we will have, as well as the \ncontinuity of medical care upon their release from prison.  Upon a release from prison, the \nDepartment shall reinstate or institute eligibility for and coverage under Medicaid to a person \nas soon as possible if the person otherwise meets eligibility requirements at that time. \n \nSection 2 of the bill requires the director of the Department of Corrections to complete the \nMedicaid application paperwork for an individual who is incarcerated as soon as practicable \nafter the individual is authorized to enroll in Medicaid as outlined in section 1.  As you can \nsee, the bill's provisions aim to improve access to Medicaid for a person who has just been \nreleased from prison.  Ideally, a person will have Medicaid coverage on the day of his or her \nrelease from prison without gaps in coverage.  \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 29, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nCurrently, we have about 19,000 people incarcerated in our state prisons, and we need to find \na way to ensure continuity of health care coverage and provide relevant social services for \nthose who are incarcerated and transitioning back into our communities.  Connecting these \npeople to Medicaid early on can facilitate their integration back into the community by \nincreasing their ability to address their health needs.  This bill will contribute to greater \nstability in their lives and provide broader benefits to all our communities and help reduce \nrecidivism within this population.  I urge you to support this bill.  Now, I would like to turn \nover my time to Director Whitley and his staff for additional remarks. \n \nRichard Whitley, Director, Department of Health and Human Services: \nThank you for the opportunity to speak on behalf of this bill.  The Department of Health and \nHuman Services (DHHS) sees this as good policy.  For evidence of why this legislation is \nneeded, go to DHHS.NV.gov/analytics and scroll down to the corrections outreach dashboard \n[Exhibit C].  For some time, we have been collecting information on inmates who are being \ndischarged and matching it to identify if they have been enrolled in Medicaid.  We do not do \na good job; we definitely can do better.  I think we do a good job in our detention facilities in \nClark and Washoe Counties with getting inmates who are leaving enrolled, but we could do \nbetter  in  the  Department  of  Corrections.    So  this  legislation,  with  the  combination  of \nenrollment and suspension, will go a long way toward those improvements. \n \nAssemblywoman Nguyen also identified the benefits, and continuity of care is the big one.  \nMany of these inmates with chronic health conditions, whether serious mental illness, HIV, \nor other conditions, are stabilized while they are incarcerated.  To continue that care upon \ndischarge could dramatically support their continuity of care.  The other element is that the \nDepartment  of  Corrections,  with  General  Fund  money,  currently  pays  for  30  days  of \ndischarge medication.  We believe there would be a savings through enrollment in Medicaid \nupon exit.  The day they leave, they would be enrolled in Medicaid and that pharmaceutical \ncost  could  be  covered,  drawing  down  a  federal  match  for  that,  which  would  result  in \na savings for the state.  So those are the two drivers.  \n \nWe currently have a contract out for our managed care.  In the urban areas—Clark and \nWashoe Counties—Medicaid utilizes a managed care model.  We have included in the \nrequest for proposal (RFP) for managed care a highlight of the criminal justice-involved \npopulation with scoring on strategies for transition to be included in the response.  That RFP \nis  currently  out,  and  we  are  looking  forward  to  innovations  from  the  managed  care \ncompanies to assist us with the transition from facility to community, and we will be scoring \nthose applications based on the response.  With me are Administrator Bierman and Deputy \nAdministrator Thompson to answer any questions. \n \nAssemblywoman Nguyen: \nDo they have any presentations or are they here to answer any questions? \n \nRichard Whitley: \nThey are just here to answer questions. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 29, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nAssemblywoman Nguyen: \nWe are ready to answer questions. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nDirector Whitley said \"We\" when he spoke about the Medicaid costs in the first 30 days after \nrelease.  Could we get clarity on who is paying for that?  How is that being financed? \n \nRichard Whitley: \n\"We\" means the State of Nevada.  The Department of Corrections currently provides 30 days \nof discharge medications to an inmate leaving.  That is paid for with General Funds.  If the \ninmate were enrolled in Medicaid, we would work with our managed care organizations \nto cover the cost and get the inmate an appointment prior to the 30 days of medication \nrunning out. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nIf we can enroll those who are going to be released before they are released, not only do we \nhave an opportunity to have a federal match for Medicaid, which would save money, but we \nwould also have an opportunity to get them an appointment with the person who will provide \nthat continuing care so we can have a better opportunity for that person to remain stable.  \nAm I understanding this correctly? \n \nRichard Whitley: \nYes, both are the two key pieces:  saving General Fund money and then the connection to an \nappointment prior to the medication running out. \n \nAssemblywoman Black: \nI do not see a fiscal note on the bill.  I understand that there might not be one for the people \nwho were on Medicaid who will now be suspended instead of removed, but what about new \npeople coming on?  How does that not cost any extra money? \n \nRichard Whitley: \nThese  individuals  are  all  eligible  for  Medicaid,  so  they  are  entitled  to  application  and \nenrollment.  In the case of those leaving on medication, we believe they may be presenting a \nburden  to  our  emergency  rooms  or  having  a  crisis  needing  intervention,  because  that \ncontinuity of care is not currently as tight as it could be if they were enrolled in Medicaid.  \nBut their eligibility would already be covered, and they would mostly be newly eligible, \nwhich is the higher federal match.  You are correct, there is no fiscal note on this, not only \nfor the operation of the enrollment, nor for the actual delivery of services under Medicaid.  \nThere would not be an additional cost.  The enrollments may go up, but people who are \neligible for Medicaid can apply at any time, and we would not deny anyone who is eligible \nfor Medicaid the enrollment. \n \nAssemblywoman Black: \nIs there any way to know roughly how many new people there might be?  If we do not \nautomatically enroll them, they may never enroll in Medicaid.  I cannot believe that there is \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 29, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nnot an added cost.  I understand that they would be eligible, but apparently there is not an \nadded cost.  Is there some way to quantify that? \n \nRichard Whitley: \nAs you can see on the dashboard I made reference to, we would continue that out to actually \nshow the follow-up services inmates received.  We could match that with the recidivism or \nreduction.  But like any population, we review their application for eligibility.  If they get a \njob and exceed the income, they would be terminated from Medicaid just like any other \npopulation.   \n \nTo your point, probably what would be interesting to look at is how many people leaving \ncorrections end up in the emergency room, perhaps with uncompensated care, or with a more \ncostly crisis because that continuity did not continue.  We have not looked at that, but we \ncertainly could.   \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nFor reference, the link Director Whitley was talking about, that dashboard, is available on \nthe Nevada Electronic Legislative Information System if you would like to check it out.  \nAre there other questions? \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nI have a question regarding success with local jails.  How has that been going for you? \n \nRichard Whitley: \nI can speak most comprehensively about the Clark County Detention Center and the Washoe \nCounty Detention Center.  We have eligibility workers who go in.  We have a good working \nrelationship with the captains at each facility.  The models are a little different in rural \nNevada; it is relationship-based with sheriffs and whether they want us in their facility.  The \nsolutions in the jail are largely written applications.  We continue to look at making it as easy \nas possible and certainly as less interruptive as possible.  In the Clark County Detention \nCenter, prior to COVID-19 we were averaging a few hundred applications a month.  With \nCOVID-19 and some of the restrictions on our staff being able to go in and assist with \neligibility, those numbers have gone done.  Captain Teel with Clark County Detention Center \nsaid that \"This is so good for our community\"; they have directly seen a reduction in \nrecidivism and asked us to get this back up—get our staff outfitted with PPE [personal \nprotective equipment] so they could go back in.  I would aspire to have our state Department \nof Corrections have outcomes like our large detention centers.  Our welfare and eligibility \nworkers do a fantastic job with getting folks enrolled. \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nIs there quantifiable data related to the detention center in Clark County you were referencing \nthat we could see?  That may help answer some of Assemblywoman Black's questions about \nthe results we are getting from lack of recidivism and the care provided through Medicaid \noffered to those inmates. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 29, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nRichard Whitley: \nYes, we have Clark and Washoe detention centers data we can provide going back to 2019. \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nAs related to that, would you have the dollar amount of what is currently being spent on the \npurchase of medications as inmates are leaving the system—those 30 days of medications \nthey are getting? \n \nRichard Whitley: \nI do not.  Within the Department of Corrections' budget, I do not know if they carve out their \npharmaceutical costs that way.  As we have this huge opportunity for improvement in the \nenrollment, it would be an important piece of data to capture—not only for that 30-day \nmedication issue, but did they get their appointment before the 30 days, and also that cost.  \nI can follow up with the Department of Corrections and ask that question. \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nThank you.  That would be helpful in understanding the kind of win this would be.  I also \nhave another clarification for you about the Medicaid match.  What is the percentage of \nMedicaid match right now?  Can you give us, dollar for dollar, on what the state puts in and \nhow much is matched through the federal programs? \n \nRichard Whitley: \nI believe primarily this population would be newly eligible, so it would be a 90 percent \nfederal match.   \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nSo for every ten cents the state puts in, ninety cents from the federal government would be \nmatched to that? \n \nRichard Whitley: \nYes. \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nThank you for the clarification.  Are there other questions from the Committee? \n \nAssemblyman Hafen: \nWhat is the state currently spending on medication for inmates? \n \nRichard Whitley: \nI do not have that information from the Department of Corrections.  Currently, health care of \ninmates is in the Department of Corrections' budget, and that would include their discharge \nmedications.  I would be happy to reach out to them and get that information. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 29, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nAre there other questions from the Committee?  [There were none.]  I will move into \ntestimony.  Do you have anyone testifying in support, Assemblywoman Nguyen? \n \nAssemblywoman Nguyen: \nI do not believe there is anyone else.  Director Whitley, was there anyone else testifying in \nsupport? \n \nRichard Whitley: \nNo, I am speaking for our Department in support of the bill. \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nWe will take support testimony from the phone lines now for A.B. 358. \n \nNick  Shepack,  Program  and  Policy  Associate,  American  Civil  Liberties  Union  of \nNevada: \nFormerly incarcerated individuals suffer disproportionately from health-related problems and \ncan pose health risks to their family members and their communities.  Prisoners experience \ninfectious diseases such as HIV-AIDS, hepatitis C, and tuberculosis at a rate five times \nhigher than those in the general public.  Many suffer from a variety of mental illnesses— \nsome very severe.  Health problems can also hinder a formerly incarcerated person's ability \nto secure employment.  Access to health care is an essential yet often ignored aspect of \nsuccessful reentry.  Medicaid expansion under the ACA [Affordable Care Act] has offered an \nunprecedented opportunity for formally incarcerated people to gain access to health care.  \nThere are many barriers for formerly incarcerated people that make it difficult to enroll upon \nrelease.  For one, they are dealing with other urgent issues such as housing or employment \nand may not have the time or bandwidth to seek health insurance post-release. \n \nThe Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, using data from the annual Medicaid budget, found \n38 states are working with prisons and 32 are working with jails to help facilitate Medicaid \nenrollment prior to an inmate's release date.  Additionally, in 37 states, Medicaid benefits are \nsuspended rather than terminated upon being incarcerated in prison.  Half of the states also \nreport that they are working to enroll parolees in Medicaid.  By ensuring that all eligible \nparties are enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid upon release from prison, we can reduce \nrecidivism rates, reduce the community spread of communicable diseases, and provide one \nmore tool for success for those being released from prison.  We urge you to support this very \nimportant piece of legislation. \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nBefore we continue with support testimony, I want to restate that testimony is limited to two \nminutes per caller.  You are always welcome to send in written testimony up to 48 hours after \nthe Committee hearing.  We will be taking 20 minutes of testimony in support. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 29, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nJim Hoffman, Member, Legislative Committee, Nevada Attorneys for Criminal Justice: \nNevada  Attorneys  for  Criminal  Justice  (NACJ)  supports  A.B.  358.    Health  care  is  an \nimportant part of preventing recidivism in formerly incarcerated people.  In particular, a lot \nof theft and drug crime is driven by untreated mental health problems or drug abuse.  By \nensuring that people have access to mental health treatment and drug counseling immediately \nupon their release, we reduce the likelihood that they will reoffend.  This is better for the \npeople  involved  and  better  for  the  community  as  a  whole.    Therefore,  NACJ  supports \nA.B. 358. \n \nKendra  G.  Bertschy,  Deputy  Public  Defender,  Washoe  County  Public  Defender's \nOffice; and representing Clark County Public Defender's Office: \nI am testifying in support of A.B. 358 on behalf of the public defender's offices in Washoe \nCounty and in Clark County.  We want to thank the bill's sponsor, Assemblywoman Nguyen, \nfor bringing this important bill forward.  This Committee and the legislative body last session \npassed A.B. 236 of the 80th Session.  The whole purpose of that bill was to enhance our \ncriminal justice system and provide individuals with services to ensure that they do not enter \ninto the criminal justice system in the first place.  This bill will expand on that and help \nto ensure  that  those  who  are  involved  in  the  criminal  justice  system,  when  they  are \nleaving jail  or  prison,  have  Medicaid  so  they  are  able  to  successfully  reenter  society \nand reduce recidivism.   \n \nAs of 2019, 43 other states have already implemented these suspension policies for those in \nprison and over 42 states have done the same for jails.  Currently, in the Clark County \nDetention Center, it costs $190 per day for healthy inmates to be housed.  In Washoe County, \nit is $130 up to $300 or $500, depending on the medication needs of the individual.  Because \nof a lack of housing, sometimes our clients are stuck in custody waiting for bed space or \nwaiting for other services because their Medicaid has been terminated.  That is time in \ncustody, and if we had the ability to provide them with resources more quickly, they would \nbe able to reintegrate sooner, which would save us money in the long run, as well as reduce \nrecidivism.  Thank you again for this bill and for your time. \n \nMaria-Teresa Liebermann-Parraga, Deputy Director, Battle Born Progress: \nI want to say \"Ditto\" to what everyone else mentioned.  Everyone pretty much covered the \nreasons we support this bill.  We want to thank Assemblywoman Nguyen for bringing this \nforward, especially at a time when, for people who are released, health care access is more \nimportant than ever during a pandemic.  We ask for everyone's support. \n \nGillian Block, representing Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers: \nThe low-income Nevadans legal aid providers serve often depend on Medicaid for their \nhealth care services, and access to health care is a vital piece of the puzzle of supporting \nindividuals who are reentering the community following incarceration.  Assembly Bill 358 \nwill ensure that people leaving the criminal justice system have the ability to quickly regain \naccess to health care services, ensuring quicker access to medications, mental health services, \nand other essential services that people need to get back on their feet and be stable following \nincarceration.   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 29, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nTerminating Medicaid coverage for incarcerated individuals unnecessarily delays access to \ncritical health care while suspension instead of termination provides continuity of care to \nformerly incarcerated people at a time when these individuals are particularly vulnerable.  \nAssembly Bill 358 promotes both individual and community health, reduces the risk of \nmortality and recidivism, and helps people succeed.  For those reasons, we support A.B. 358. \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nAre there any more callers in support?  [There were none.]  Next, we will hear testimony \nin opposition to A.B. 358.  [There was none.]  Is there anyone wishing to testify who \nis neutral on this bill?  [There was no one.]  Assemblywoman Nguyen, do you have any \nclosing remarks? \n \nAssemblywoman Nguyen: \nI do not.  I do not know if Director Whitley has any closing remarks.  I know he has been \nworking on this a lot with local jails to get people covered.  I do see this as a cost savings for \nour General Fund.  The idea that we are paying for medication for people who are eligible for \nwhat is essentially a 1-to-9 federal match is crazy to me, especially during a time when we \nare trying to do more with less.  This puts us in line with 43 other states in preventing \nrecidivism or reducing recidivism, saving our state money and also continuing the continuity \nof care for people who are incarcerated and who are trying to reintegrate successfully into \nour communities.  Director Whitley, do you have anything you want to say in closing? \n \nRichard Whitley: \nI do not think I could say it any better than you just did, so thank you. \n \nAssemblywoman Nguyen: \nDid we hear any testimony in neutral? \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nI did call for testimony in neutral but there was no one on the line, nor was there anyone on \nZoom. \n \nAssemblywoman Nguyen: \nThank you, and again, I would ask everyone to support A.B. 358. \n \nVice Chair Peters: \nWith that, I will close the hearing on A.B. 358 and transfer the chairmanship back to Chair \nNguyen. \n \n[Assemblywoman Nguyen reassumed the Chair.] \n \n[Exhibit D was submitted but not discussed and will become part of the record.] \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI will open the hearing on Assembly Bill 343 and turn this over to Assemblywoman Thomas.  \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 29, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nAssembly Bill 343:  Provides for walking audits of urbanized areas. (BDR 40-742) \n \nAssemblywoman Clara Thomas, Assembly District No. 17: \nI am introducing Assembly Bill 343 which addresses the health and walkability of our \ncommunities.  Assembly Bill 343 is aimed at improving accessibility and public health.  We \nAmericans have come to appreciate the link between urban planning and the health of our \ncitizens.  Being able to walk to stores and restaurants serves the dual purpose of improving \nour health and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  By making cities safe and accessible for \nchildren, older adults, and persons with disabilities, we improve the quality of life for all of \nus.  Walking paths, bike lanes, safe crosswalks, and curb cuts give us a chance to get outside \nand move or commute to work without a car. \n \nThere are initiatives in states all over the United States that recognize this link between \npedestrian- and bike-friendly communities and the improved public health outcomes that \nfollow.  Nationally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and AARP, along \nwith many land-use and transportation-planning organizations, have endorsed the use of \nwalking audits to better understand a community's needs.  Our own regional transportation \ncommissions and Nevada's Department of Transportation participate in a similar program \nknown as Complete Streets.  But it is my hope that this bill will take these efforts to the next \nlevel in Nevada by assembling a diverse group of people to conduct walking audits and to \ninclude accessibility to healthy food options. \n \n\"Food  deserts\"  are  a  well-documented  problem  in  many  inner-city  communities,  and \nLas Vegas is no exception.  The pandemic has made it painfully clear that a lack of access to \nhealthy food to fight diabetes and other preventable diseases continues to be a national issue. \n \nI want to mention that, while I do not have any amendments to present to you today, I am \nworking with stakeholders on a possible amendment to the bill.  I will make sure to share any \npossible amendments with you prior to a work session.   One of the amendments I am \nexploring is whether there are other agencies better suited to conduct or organize the audits, \nsuch as the regional planning agencies or regional transportation commissions.  Another \naspect would be the incorporation of geographic information system, or GIS, mapping as a \nway to make data from the audits more broadly available. \n \nWith that background, let me briefly go over the key provisions of the bill.  Section 1 lays out \nthe requirement for the district health departments to conduct walking audits of urbanized \nareas within their jurisdiction every three years.  The state Division of Public and Behavioral \nHealth would be tasked with conducting the audits in urbanized areas not covered by the two \ndistrict health departments in Clark and Washoe Counties.  The audits will be organized by \ncensus districts in urbanized areas to determine whether the physical environment contributes \nto the health of the community or detracts from it. \n \nSection 1 further provides that audit results will be submitted to the city council, county \ncommission, and any planning commission or regional entity with jurisdiction over the area.  \nIn addition, the audit results would be posted on the health district's and Division's Internet \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 29, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nwebsites.  Section 1, subsection 2 lays out the makeup of the audit groups and the goals of \nassessing land use, site design, and other factors contributing to public health, such as \nlighting, curb cuts, crosswalks, sidewalks, and benches.  I have also included access to \nhealthy  food  in  the  walking  audits  because  too  many  inner-city  residents  have  limited \ngrocery and restaurant options.  It is hard to eat well and be healthy when you are relegated \nto shopping at a convenience store or eating at a fast-food restaurant. \n \nLastly, the audits would include suggestions on ways to enhance all these factors and thereby \nimprove public health in the audited area.  In closing, I urge your support of A.B. 343 and the \nconcept of walking audits to better understand our communities and their needs so we can \nwork towards improving public health.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo I have any questions from Committee members? \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThis is a new concept for me, so how many other states have this?  I live in a very rural area, \nand  one  would  have  a  tough  time  walking  there.    I  understand  this  addresses  certain \npopulation sizes.  Can you give me some statistics or where to turn concerning other cities \nthat have this and their results?  I understand the intent.  I believe in getting out in local \ncommunities; I believe in being part of your community.  As a doctor who still makes house \ncalls, nothing opens your eyes more than going out into your community to see what the \nrealities are for these folks.  I would really appreciate having some direction so I could do my \nhomework and look into this further. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nJust about every major city in the United States has walkability audits such as New York.  In \nour own state, back in 2005, Assembly Bill 231 of the 73rd Session had walkability for our \npublic schools.  We have walkability audits dealing with our children and public schools to \nsee about transportation and whether two miles was adequate for them to walk to school.   \n \nI want to improve on the concept of A.B. 231 of the 73rd Session which would be for our \ngeneral community, especially now in 2021.  There are so many things I noted this past \nsummer when we were going around the community to see if children were able to engage on \nthe Internet.  There were places that were very dark.  There were places where sidewalks \nwere crumbling.  There were places where we needed curb cuts.  Just walking around during \nmy campaign, I noticed these things.  We have to move to the twenty-first century as far as \nhaving food accessibility for our citizens.  If we can have our children walk two miles to \nschool, surely we can have a grocery store within two miles of our communities. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank you for that.  I look forward to having more information and some data. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nYes, I will get that. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 29, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you, Assemblywoman Thomas, and if you could provide that to Patrick Ashton, he \nwill get that documentation out to the rest of the Committee.  Are there any other questions? \n \nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \nI have a question about section 1, subsection 2, paragraph (b) which lists several things to \nlook for.  Those are all important things to look for, and you also say \"including, without \nlimitation,\" so they can look for other things.  One thing that occurs to me that might be \nworth including specifically is to look for commercial operations that might foul the air with \ntoxic chemicals that might be produced at the site.  We know those are more common in \nminority and lower-income communities.  Perhaps that is picked up somewhere else, but it is \nan important thing for us to know about. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nWe will look into that also. \n \nAssemblywoman Black: \nWhat is an \"urbanized area\"? \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nAn urbanized area generally would be what we would consider the urban community. \n \nAssemblywoman Black: \nThat is my concern.  I do not know what it is.  There is no formal definition. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nI  can  get a  formal  definition  for you  [Exhibit  E],  but  it  is  the  same  thing  for  a  rural \ncommunity.  Is there a definition for that? \n \nAssemblywoman Black: \nIf you are saying we are going to study an urbanized area, we need to be able to identify what \nan urbanized area is.  Is there a population threshold?  Is there a density threshold? \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nYou are correct.  There is a population threshold.  As the bill indicates, with Clark County \nthere is \"a population of 700,000 or more.\"  In less populated areas it would be less than \n700,000. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe have Ms. Karly O'Krent, our Legislative Counsel Bureau committee counsel, with us.  \nShe might be able to describe what that means in statute. \n \nKarly O'Krent, Committee Counsel: \nThe provisions of this bill only apply in a county that is over 700,000 people.  Currently, that \nis only Clark County, so an \"urbanized area\" would be Clark County. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 29, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nAssemblywoman Black: \nSo the purpose of this is to collect the data and then the data is put on the health department's \nwebsite.  Say there is not a store where you can buy healthy food; we have simply identified \nthat.  We have not taken any steps to change it; we would just say that an area is lacking this \nor needs cuts into the sidewalks.  It is just collecting data.  I would like to understand what \nthe intent is. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nYes, the bill wants to clarify what those areas are lacking, and we want to present it to the \ncounty commissioners, as I stated in my address, and other entities so that we can afford this \nchange.  There is one thing we have to remember:  urbanized areas are missing a lot of grant \nmoney from the federal government.  When you change the way an area is and you can \ndocument it, you can apply for a grant; and with those grants, you can make changes.  When \nwe identify that certain areas are missing healthy food options, that is a big thing, and the \nreason why we can afford change is to, hopefully, get these grocery stores that can give us \nhealthy food options to build. \n \nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \nThis issue is very near and dear to my heart as I represent a community that is within the \nurbanized area of Las Vegas, Assembly District 6.  The gathering of this information is very \nimportant for all the reasons she stated.  Once a problem or situation is identified, then we \nhave quantifiable data we can use as the basis for grants and to try and find funding to \nresolve some of these issues.  Have you had an opportunity to meet with anyone from our \nlocal regional transportation commissions, either Washoe or the Regional Transportation \nCommission of Southern Nevada (RTC), to see what they have gathered, how they gather, \nand whether there is an opportunity for collaboration? \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nWe have been in contact with the transportation commission.  This week we will be sitting \ndown with all the stakeholders to clarify the language in the bill.  We will get all concerned \nentities together so we can get this information.  Right now, some of the things Washoe \nCounty and Clark County representatives—Joanna Jacob and Joelle Gutman Dodson—their \nconcern is putting the weight on the health districts.  I agreed that since we already have a \nway of assessing the audits through the RTCs, that perhaps we can get together with them \nand then the costs would not be burdensome on the health district because this is something \nthey already do.  We can quantify what A.B. 343 is looking to do because they already have \na way of auditing certain communities. \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nI have a question regarding section 1, subsection 1 and the three years that the audit needs to \ntake place.  How was the three-year time period determined versus two or four years? \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nLooking at A.B. 231 of the 73rd Session, we got the information from that bill.  As I said, \ngoing back to the stakeholders meeting we will be having, we will decide whether it will be \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 29, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nthree years or five years.  That would be in conjunction with the transportation commission \nand/or RTC.  When they walk to get their information, we want to make sure we are not \nputting due pressure on them to get another.  We want it to be concisely done together, so I \nwill be addressing that and I will get that answer for you. \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nI believe there are zones the federal government has already established, like Level 3 zones, \nwhich  are  economically  disadvantaged  zones.    If  you  get  SBA  [Small  Business \nAdministration] loans in those areas, you can get some forgiveness, so this would really help \nthat process.  They would know what they could build in those areas and what the area \nactually needs.  Am I putting those puzzle pieces together correctly? \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nI have not discussed zoning or zones.  I will bring that question up with the stakeholders this \nweek. \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nAgain, I may not be putting those puzzle pieces together correctly, but I remember some \nwork I did in my other job.  We were getting loan possibilities and they were talking about \neconomically disadvantaged areas.  I am thinking that this would work wonderfully, by \ndetermining what is needed in those areas, to encourage investors to build in those areas so \nthey can get some benefits for that through the federal government.   \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nThank you so much, and I will include that in our conversation.  It sounds like a good idea. \n \nAssemblyman Hafen: \nWe have the Nevada New Market Jobs Act which allows certain business entities to receive a \ncredit in certain communities if they make these investments being talked about today.  Have \nyou talked to Clark County and their planning department to see if they are currently working \non something similar?  I know that in Nye County we looked at this, not as extensively as \nthis bill proposes, but some of our recommendations came out to go into our master plan, to \nexpand bike lanes and things of that nature.  I did not know if there was any coordination \nwith Clark County, and I was curious. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAssemblywoman Thomas, I see Ms. Jacob from Clark County on the line. Possibly she can \nanswer Assemblyman Hafen's question after we have taken testimony in support, opposition, \nand neutral. \n \nAt this time, we will begin testimony in support of A.B. 343. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 29, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nJosé  Silva,  Environmental  Justice  Organizer,  Progressive  Leadership  Alliance  of \nNevada: \nWe are here in support of A.B. 343.  For years, constituents in Clark County have been \nraising awareness on issues that add significant pressure to communities of lower incomes.  \nNot everyone who lives in the county is the sole owner of a vehicle.  Many times, a vehicle is \nshared between household members and not all folks can get where they need to when they \nneed to. \n \nI live about a mile away from a supermarket.  It is a 4-minute drive, but if I was to walk \nthere, it is a 30-minute walk, and walking back is also an additional 30 minutes.  One side of \nthe street has a paved sidewalk, and the other side does not have a paved sidewalk.  This \nstreet in general is very dark during the evening.  Creating a process to help increase \nfeasibility of pedestrian travel would be an important step in raising quality of life for \nnon-vehicle-owner constituents.  Although this may sound detached from the feasibility of \nbeing a pedestrian, the importance of reducing vehicle contamination from our communities \nand neighborhoods plays a crucial role in maintaining the health of Nevadans.  In addition, \nthe American Heart Association, in a 2019 ozone report, ranked Las Vegas as the thirteenth \nmost ozone-contaminated city in the U.S.  Contamination can lead to Nevadans becoming ill, \nit increases medical costs, and in worst-case scenarios, it takes lives away.  I urge your \nsupport  of  this  legislation  to  address  the  public  health  impacts  of  our  neighborhood \nenvironments.  \n \nChristi Cabrera, Policy and Advocacy Director, Nevada Conservation League: \nI would like to echo the comments of the previous speaker.  Nevada is ranked the eleventh \nmost dangerous state in the nation for pedestrians, and we must do more to make sure our \nstreets are safe for everyone.  We believe this bill will help our state better understand and \naddress  walkable  neighborhoods  and  move  toward  creating  safe  environments  for \npedestrians,  bicyclists,  motorists,  and  transit  riders.    Walkable  neighborhoods  increase \nphysical activities and promote healthier communities and can make our communities more \nsafe, accessible, and enjoyable for everyone.  Increasing walkability can also encourage \npeople to leave their cars behind, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions and pollution.  We \nwould like to thank Assemblywoman Thomas for bringing this bill forward, and we urge the \nCommittee's support. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nLet  us  go  to  our  next  caller  in  support.    [Additional  support  testimony  from  Dora \nUchel-Martinez was taken after opposition testimony.]   \n \nDo we have any callers in opposition?   \n \nJoelle Gutman Dodson, Government Affairs Liaison, Washoe County Health District: \nI want to thank the bill's sponsor for having an in-depth conversation with me, and I look \nforward to further conversations.  While we are certainly in support of the concept and work \nin  the  areas  Assemblywoman  Thomas  has  addressed  regarding  environmental  justice, \nnutrition deserts, air quality, and walkability to resources, unfortunately as written, we are in \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 29, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nopposition to the bill today because it is essentially an unfunded mandate for the health \ndistricts that we cannot afford right now.  I have submitted a fiscal note, although I do not see \nit on NELIS [Nevada Electronic Legislative Information System]. \n \nRight now, health districts in general might not be the appropriate placement for this bill and \nwould require a professional skill set and technology database or system we do not have now.  \nIt would require hiring and purchasing that kind of equipment.  There are several things \nhappening  in  each  of  our  communities  north  and  south  that  may  meet  some  of  the \nAssemblywoman's needs for this bill, and I look forward to a conversation, possibly with the \nRTCs of northern and southern Nevada as well as with the Truckee Meadows Regional \nPlanning Agency and the Southern Nevada Regional Planning Coalition.  I think we can get \nto a solution, and I look forward to further conversations.   \n \n \nDora Uchel-Martinez, Private Citizen, Reno, Nevada: \nI apologize.  I was calling in support but I had so much trouble with my phone.  May I \nproceed or do you want me to call back? \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI know everyone is having difficulty and I am flexible on this situation, so go ahead and \ntestify in support and I will ask the Committee secretary to reclassify your testimony. \n \nDora Uchel-Martinez: \nI am calling in support of A.B. 343.  I am totally blind and have a service dog.  I live in north \nReno in District 27.  I utilize the sidewalks.  Pretty soon my kids will be going into the \nmilitary and I will not have a driver and I cannot always depend on buses.  Sometimes they \nare late and sometimes they are cancelled due to mechanical issues and lack of drivers.  \nUsable and accessible sidewalks are awesome.  My service dog and my husband, we walk a \nlot, and if there was a sidewalk all the way to Carson, I would be there too. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe will go back to testimony in opposition to the bill.  [There was none.]  We will go now to \ncallers in neutral to the bill.   \n \nBradley Mayer, representing Southern Nevada Health District: \nCertainly  the  intent  of  this  bill  is  good  for  public  health.    We  are  working  with  the \nAssemblywoman.   We have been in contact with her and we are working on this bill \ntogether; but we at the health district are also engaged in some of these walking audits—\nspecifically we are doing one with the City of Henderson in conjunction with their parks and \nrecreation department that also focuses on low-income census tracts.  We are also working \nwith the City of Las Vegas and University of Nevada, Las Vegas to help develop a decision-\nsupport tool for city public works.  It is a tool that planning, public works, and transportation \nprofessionals use to grade health, safety, and equity-related considerations to land use to \nsupport safe, walkable, bikeable, connected communities.  So we are doing some of this \nwork. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 29, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \n \nWe are still evaluating the fiscal and operational impact of this.  The bill came out last week, \nand then of course is being heard today.  We are looking forward to working with the \nAssemblywoman as she works on some amendments for this bill ahead of the work session.  \n \nJoanna Jacob, Government Affairs Manager, Clark County: \nI am calling in to see if I can answer the question raised by Assemblyman Hafen.  I am also \nspeaking in neutral on this bill.  I tried to work with Assemblywoman Thomas last week to \nconnect her to appropriate people at the RTC in southern Nevada because they are engaged \nin transportation planning and that includes walkability for the regions they serve, including \nClark County.  This is the bread and butter of what they do so we are trying to engage in this \nprocess.  As Assemblyman Hafen noted, our comprehensive planning department does assess \nthis, especially a Complete Street policy, as we are rewriting our codes right now.  We are \nengaged in looking at this in a comprehensive way.  We have added bike lanes and sidewalks \nwhere feasible every time we update a street in Clark County.  We always address ADA \n[Americans With Disabilities Act] compliance, so this has been something discussed at our \nboard, so Assemblyman Hafen, yes, we are engaged in doing this work as well as in a \ncomprehensive planning way that we do in unincorporated Clark County.  We will continue \nto work with the Assemblywoman on this bill and take part in the stakeholder groups, \nMadam Chair, and assist where we can. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo we have any other callers in neutral?  [There were none.]  At this time, I will turn this \nover to Assemblywoman Thomas for any closing remarks. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nAs I stated earlier, we are working to solidify this bill to make it amenable to just about every \nagency that has a hand in affording the walkability for our residents.  We know that this is \nsomething that is probably new to the state of Nevada because when I first moved here in \n1982, they did not have sidewalks.  So we are gradually moving into the twenty-first century \nand I look forward to meeting with the stakeholders this week. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWith that, I will close the hearing on A.B. 343 and open the hearing on Assembly Bill 344.  \nAssemblywoman Thomas, you may begin when you are ready. \n \nAssembly Bill 344:  Authorizes the establishment of a program to facilitate transition of \nthe care of older persons and vulnerable persons. (BDR 38-743) \n \nAssemblywoman Clara Thomas, Assembly District No. 17: \nThank you for the opportunity to present Assembly Bill 344 before you today.  This bill aims \nto improve care coordination and continuity of care for elderly Nevadans and individuals \nwith disabilities following discharge from the hospital.  Before I begin, I would just like to \ndraw your attention to the amendment I submitted which should be on the Nevada Electronic \nLegislative Information System (NELIS) and which I will discuss in a minute [Exhibit F]. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 29, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \n \nBeing in the hospital is hard, and when a person is discharged, there are often aftercare \ninstructions to follow, new medications to take, and follow-up appointments to attend.  The \npost-discharge time can be hard for anyone, but it is especially hard on elderly individuals \nand those with disabilities—and particularly for those who do not have a support system, or \nwhose  caregivers  are  not  familiar  with  navigating  the  health  care  system.    I  recently \nexperienced this firsthand when my mother was in the hospital.  After her stroke, no one \nrealized that this was the onset of dementia.  Mom became very confused and frustrated \nwhenever seeing her doctors and could not remember what she was advised to do.  My \nbrother, as her caregiver, would ask to go into the examination room so he was able to get the \ninformation and assist Mom with her meds and other doctor's orders. \n \nThe goal of this bill is to authorize the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to \ncreate  a  program  to  improve  care  coordination  and  continuity  of  care  for  vulnerable \nNevadans after they are discharged from the hospital.  Specifically, section 1, subsection 1 of \nA.B. 344 authorizes the Division of Aging and Disability Services (ADSD) within DHHS to \nestablish a program through regulation to help older Nevadans and Nevadans with disabilities \nwith the transition from the hospital to their home. \n \nCurrently, the bill language refers to \"older persons\" and \"vulnerable persons.\"  However, in \nworking  with  ADSD  on  this  bill,  I  am  proposing  an  amendment  to  replace  the  term \n\"vulnerable person\" with \"person with a disability,\" which is language currently used in \nNevada Revised Statutes (NRS).  This amendment does not change the intent of the bill but \nensures consistency in the use of existing terms. \n \nIf ADSD creates this type of program, it must provide for cooperation between hospital staff \nwho are responsible for discharging these individuals, as well as the individuals and their \ncaregivers.  It must also facilitate the coordination of health care and social services to \nsupport these individuals and their caregivers. \n \nSection 1, subsection 2 of the bill allows ADSD to limit the program to certain groups of \nolder individuals or people with disabilities based on funding.  It authorizes the Division to \naccept gifts, grants, and donations in order to establish and operate the program, and to use \nother  available  options  to  fund  it,  including  billing  third-party  payers—such  as  health \ninsurance—for services provided by the program.  That brings me to another amendment I \nam proposing in section 1, subsection 2, paragraph (c), which follows \"Use other options \navailable to fund the program, including, without limitation, billing third parties for the \nservices  provided  by  the  program\"  for  current  plan  members.    That  is  the  additional \nverbiage—\"for current plan members.\" \n \nSection 1, subsection 3 of the bill defines \"older person\" to mean an individual who is \n60 years of age or older.  It defines the term \"third party\" to include various health insurers, \nand it defines \"vulnerable person.\"  However, as I mentioned, the proposed amendment \nwould replace the definition of \"vulnerable person\" with the term \"person with a disability.\" \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 29, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nFinally, this bill should not have a fiscal impact to the state, as it authorizes ADSD to \nestablish the program to the extent money is available for this purpose.  At this point, I would \nlike to turn my time over to Jeffrey Klein, President and CEO of Nevada Senior Services.  \nMr. Klein's organization currently has a program that is doing this type of work, which has \nbeen extremely effective.  We have submitted two documents that I believe he will discuss so \nthat everyone has a better understanding of the type of program we envision through this bill.  \nAfter his presentation, we would be happy to answer any questions, and I believe Cheyenne \nPasquale,  Social  Services  Chief,  ADSD,  DHHS,  is  available  to  answer  any  technical \nquestions from the Division's side. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThe amendments you were speaking about in your presentation were uploaded onto NELIS \nthis morning. \n \nJeffrey B. Klein, President/CEO, Nevada Senior Services: \nI  am  also  a  member  of  the  Nevada  Commission  on  Aging  and  chair  its  legislative \nsubcommittee.  My thanks to Assemblywoman Thomas for bringing forth A.B. 344 and my \nthanks for the invitation to be here today. \n \nThe PowerPoint [Exhibit G] we have submitted has more material than I intend to cover, but \nit will be useful reference information for you.  Nevada Senior Services operates two adult \nday health care centers [page 2].  We provide in-home respite, home modifications, clinical \ngeriatric assessment, we have a wellness set of initiatives, and we are the Nevada Care \nConnection Resource Center for Lincoln, Nye, Esmeralda, and the majority of Clark County.  \nWe are very much on the ground floor of the development of what we call \"Hospital 2 \nHome\" which is a care transitions program for some of the most difficult populations we \nhave. \n \nAs you know, Nevada is among the states with the fastest-growing senior populations, if not \ntotal populations, in the country [pages 3 and 4].  With that comes the issue of dementia.  \nNevada has seen an astronomical increase in deaths from dementia.  Our Alzheimer's disease \ndeaths have increased 261 percent since 2000 [page 5].  It is the sixth leading cause of death \nin Nevada and a major driver of hospital admissions and readmissions.  We are faced \nnationally, but very much in Nevada, with the fact that while lifespan is much longer, health \nspan is becoming more problematic because we live longer.  We have people with multiple \nchronic conditions which ultimately lead them to be greater consumers of health care and \nmore likely to be admitted to the hospital. \n \nPersons  with  dementia  and  the  frail  elderly  typically  will  have  care  partners,  family \nmembers,  who  are  responsible  for  assisting  them  and  maintaining  themselves  in  the \ncommunity [page 6].  Those folks can be very stressed when family members have chronic \ndiseases.  We know that dementia in particular increases the burden on acute care systems.  \nAny hospital executive will tell you that, and I was one for most of my career.  It creates \nexcessive resource consumption, higher complication rates both in the hospital and after the \nhospital, and generally results in poorer outcomes.  They are more likely to be hospitalized \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 29, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nthan the general population over age 65 [page 7].  About 25 percent of all hospital patients \naged 65 and over have a dementia, and there are all sorts of studies about the issue of \ndementia in the record.  Very few of the folks that are hospitalized or who even have a \ndementia have it existing openly in their hospital record.  To quote my wife's grandmother, \n\"Don't let them know how old you are and don't let them know if you are having problems \nthinking.\"    There  is  a  fear  factor  in  seniors  in  particular,  but  also  in  other  vulnerable \npopulations, in having the hospital staffs even be aware the patient has this kind of fragile \nsituation.  Hospitalization rates for persons with dementia are more than twice what they are \nfor the cognitively healthy.   \n \nA third of hospitalized persons with Alzheimer's disease average one-and-a-half to two \nhospital stays a year [page 8].   People with dementia comprise 40 percent of total hospital \n30-day readmissions.  Hospitals are faced with the huge problem of people who are living \nalone at home with dementia representing an unsafe discharge which clogs hospital beds \nbecause the hospitals have difficulty even discharging them.  Clark County, for instance, has \none of the highest readmission rates in the country with over 35 percent of Medicare patients \nbeing readmitted to the hospital.  They are more likely to not regain their health [page 9].  \nFor people with discharge issues associated with their ability to function in their homes, it \nmakes them a more complicated discharge and more dangerous to discharge to the home \nwithout successful supports.  They are more likely to get discharged to a nursing home, \nwhich  we  know  is  not  the  location  of  choice  as  we  found  out  during  the  COVID-19 \nepidemic.  They are also three to seven times more likely to be living in a nursing home three \nmonths after discharge, which represents both a human cost and an economic cost to the state \nof Nevada. \n \nOur Hospital 2 Home program started originally with a pilot program funded by the Aging \nand Disability Services Division as a subset of a federal Administration for Community \nLiving program grant [page 10, Exhibit G].  We piloted what we thought was an innovative \napproach to dealing with this population.  We brought 25 dyads or 50 people through the \nprogram to test it, and it worked so well that we were invited by the federal Administration \nfor Community Living to apply for a much larger three-year grant which just ended.    \n \nBecause of the grant, this population was focused heavily on the dementia population— \npersons with intellectual developmental disabilities who were at much higher risk for a \ndementia, the frail elderly who were hospitalized for any medical condition, live-alones, and, \nmost recently, COVID-19-related admissions and discharges [page 11].  Right now, we have \na caseload of over 150 of those persons in Clark County who have either been directly or \nindirectly impacted by COVID-19 and have been discharged from hospital to home.  We use \na model originally developed by Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, adapted it for \nour environment, and developed a collaboration initially with the seven hospitals of Valley \nHealth System [page 12].  Now, it has spread to most of the hospitals in southern Nevada.  \nCollaboration  is  really  important,  and  one  thing  it  brings,  in  addition  to  hospital \ncollaborations  for  the  clients,  is  post-discharge  care  transitions  wraparound  for  all  the \nservices they need. \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 29, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nThese days, the approach is both in-person and/or telephonic because of the COVID-19 \nlimitations [page 13].  The first contact is within one to two days post-discharge if we do not \ncatch them in the hospital first.  The duration of the core program is 30 days.  It focuses on \nthe values and desires of the individual, and that is really critical [page 14].  We talk about \nbeing person-centered, but it is more than that.  People crave autonomy, and those of us in \nthe health care field, and even as family members, crave safety.  Very often we are inclined \nto sacrifice the wishes of the person trying to be discharged from the hospital or its complex \nin favor of what we think is going to keep them safe.  That push and pull is really important \nin Hospital 2 Home.  We start with the desires of the individual and we look to see how we \ncan do that in a safe way.  It includes both internal and external referrals for ongoing \nsupports.   \n \nWe  start  with  this  30-day  program,  we  develop  personalized  care  plans,  we  deal  with \nbehavioral and psychological symptoms, and the goal is to support these folks to not only \nmake the transition, but to be able to engage access to supports which keep them safe in the \ncommunity [page 15].  We have added a fairly innovative feature to the program called \n\"respite coaching\" [page 16].  Right now, we are evaluating what the best personnel would be \nto ultimately, long-term, deliver that service—we are starting to think community health \nworkers which has a special place in Nevada.  The idea of the respite coach is to decrease \npost-hospitalization stress and caregiver burden because we know that caregiver burden is \nlikely to cause readmission or long-term care placement.  It provides a short-term, intensive \nrespite but also allows us to provide training so the family caregiver can handle what is going \non in the home and make connections for long-term supports [page 17, Exhibit G].  These \nrespite coaches, which are teams, are an intrinsic part of this whole idea of care transitions \nwhich is unique to Nevada and to our program.             \n \nThe  service  delivery  also  ties  into  referrals  to  community  public  and  private  resources \n[page 18].  We have licensed social workers on the team.  We provide case management and \nlong-term services and supports, which is a natural for our aging and disability resource \ncenters;  basic  needs  programs;  and  caregiver  education  and  support,  which  is  really \nimportant.  How do we educate family caregivers to be better navigators of the health care \nsystem and the social services system both coming and going?  We have created a series of \nworkshops for family caregivers and for health care professionals [page 19].   \n \nOutcomes—and these are last year's numbers [page 20]:  out of 363 clients/participants who \ncame through the program, the readmissions for the same diagnosis-related group was zero.  \nNot one person was readmitted to the hospital, and we are excited about that not only \nbecause of the human savings, but for the financial savings of keeping people successfully in \ntheir homes—not having them bounce in and out of the hospital.  There were 6 out of the 363 \nwho ultimately were readmitted for a different diagnosis; for example, someone had a stroke \nand then three months later fell and broke a hip—that was a different admission. \n \nA couple of interesting things came out of some of our studies that I think will help you \nunderstand the pragmatics of the program and how important they are.  If you take a look at \nwhat we call \"first tier\" discharge challenges, insufficient support at home is 66 percent of \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 29, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nthe cases [page 21], so we know that this is a critical factor.  Concerning referrals for \ncaregiver support [page 22], 76 percent of the people discharged required caregiver support, \n75 percent required respite care, and then home modifications were 36 percent.  These are \ncritical for wrapping this into the whole idea of a successful discharge.  Basically, what is \nhappening with this program now is it is more ubiquitous.  We started with dementia and \nthen moved on to broader cognitive impairments, then COVID-19, and now the broad arena \nof people who are complex—have family caregivers or have an array of problems which \nmake them difficult to be discharged.  We know that it clears beds in the hospitals faster.  We \nknow it eliminates unsafe discharges to homes.  We know it predicts outcomes.  We know it \nkeeps people out of long-term care and therefore reduces their risk for things like COVID-19 \nor pneumonias or even the flu.  It has been a highly successful program.   \n \nWe are very supportive of the state of Nevada having a broad-based program to assist \nhospitals, to have this resource available and most importantly, to assist our seniors and those \npersons who are at highest risk to be able to get back to home and stay there—without \nreadmissions, without possible utilization of services, and without the need for long-term \ncare placement.  My thanks to Assemblywoman Thomas for taking on this very tough issue \nand one that has a big impact on an aging and fragile population. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nWe are open to answer questions. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAssemblywoman Titus, go ahead with your question when you are ready. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nAs a provider, having been administrator and director of a long-term care unit and working in \nemergency rooms discharging patients, there is already a mandatory requirement for safe \ndischarges.  We have discharge planners, patient advocates, and communications.  We have \nto have that \"warm handoff,\" that safe discharge.  Does this bill change any of that?  That is \nmy first question.  My second question is, are we now limiting this to just persons with \ndisabilities?  Do we now not have to have that safe discharge for all the other patients I \ndischarge?  And finally, I would like some more details on some of the studies you did.  It \nsounds as though you are already doing this.  What will this law change that you are not \nalready doing? \n \nJeffrey Klein: \nOne of the issues about this kind of Hospital 2 Home program is that it focuses on the most \ncomplex cases that traditional discharge planning does not get to.  The example I always give \nis a 45-year-old who had gallbladder surgery and the discharge planner comes through the \ndoor and says, \"When can your person pick you up?  You are going home today, and make \nsure you take your medications and get back to your doctor.\"  If the hospital has a good care \ntransitions initiative, they follow up to make sure you filled your prescription and you \nbooked your doctor's appointment.  To a family caregiver who is so totally fried that they are \nbasically immobile because they have been taking care of a loved one for a long period of \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 29, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \ntime who has now ended up in the hospital, that person needs way more help and supports; \nthat person has issues.  To give you an example, very often they do not have a working \nrefrigerator when they go home, there is no food in there and no way to fill the medications.  \nWhat Hospital 2 Home tries to do is decompress that family caregiver and get life back under \ncontrol.  In the first couple of days in particular, we try to take away a lot of those really \npressing issues that have so immobilized those family caregivers so they can clear the air, \ndeal with them, and then have a support system.  That is fairly unique, and not necessarily a \nprogram everyone needs.  We think for our highly complex, more fragile family caregiving \nsituations—whether in the elderly population or in the adults-with-disabilities population—\nthey find it very valuable.  Not only is it humane, but it is financially beneficial. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nJust to be clear, you are already doing this.  You have this program.  Do we need legislation \nto enact a program you are already doing? \n \nJeffrey Klein: \nIt is not available to everybody.  It was done originally through a federal grant which is now \nover.  We have it available on a limited basis through some minor funding we have available \nthrough  ADSD—Older  Americans  Act—or  COVID-19  money  which  will  expire  on \nSeptember 30 of this year—or through a limited number of insurers that are willing to pay for \nportions of the service.  It is not yet covered by Medicare as we know it, nor is it yet covered \nby Medicaid as we know it.  It only exists to the extent that we are able to provide funding \nand do it for free for people. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nNowhere in this legislation does it mandate that Medicaid or Medicare pays for it, but does it \nenable you to accept grants to expand the program? \n \nJeffrey Klein: \nThe ADSD would be able to accept those grants and then contract with us or others to help \ndeliver the program.  More importantly, I hope it sets a platform for Medicaid to cover the \nservices where it will be cost-beneficial.  Also, it encourages the hospitals to urge their \nmanaged  care  partners to  participate  in  it.    Right  now,  we  have  several  managed  care \norganizations that are looking at it, but certainly, encouragement from the State of Nevada \nwould help. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThat brings me back to your statement about readmissions.  You testified that no one was \nreadmitted for the original diagnosis.  What was the length of time?  Was it within 30 days \nthat no one was readmitted for their original diagnosis?  Was the diagnosis limited to mental \ndementia?  What was the diagnosis no one was readmitted for, and over what period of time? \n \nJeffrey Klein: \nThe study had 363 people in it over a 3-year period of time—really it was over 2.5 years \nbecause the first 6 months was a planning cycle.  It included a wide range of diagnoses from \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 29, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \nsurgeries  to  heart  failure,  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease,  the  late  effects  of \ndiabetes—so there was a wide range.  The initial work was limited to persons with a \ndementia—not necessarily diagnosed dementia, but a perceived dementia if no diagnosis was \navailable.  Later it became broadly available to complex families with COVID-19.  Some of \nthose numbers are people who had a COVID-19 diagnosis or who were admitted to the \nhospital with a suspected COVID-19 diagnosis. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe also have Ms. Pasquale, Chief of ADSD, and she might also be able to answer the \nquestion concerning why this legislation is needed if we are already doing it in some aspect. \n \nCheyenne  Pasquale,  Social  Services  Chief,  Aging  and  Disability  Services  Division, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services: \nTo Mr. Klein's point, they piloted this program and were able to develop a model that can be \nreplicated to scale.  This legislation offers ADSD the opportunity to build capacity across the \nstate and make this type of program available to a broader population. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAssemblywoman Titus, does that answer your question? \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThere is nothing that prohibits this from happening since we are already doing it in some \nform.  I guess the answer to my question is that it enables them to potentially expand the \nprogram and look at future payment resources. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI will follow up with that to see if we can get some clarity on the record.  Ms. Pasquale, \nwould this enable us to apply for different grants and funding?  Without this, would we not \nbe able to? \n \nCheyenne Pasquale: \nIt would not prevent us from applying for grants if we did not have this legislation.  What it \ndoes do is it gives us a little more \"backing,\" I would say, when applying for grants to say \nthat this is a priority for the state.  It is a legislatively approved program and that can help \nmake us more competitive in our grant writing. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAm I correct in saying legislative backing or support would enhance applications of people \nwho wanted to get into a grant program?  Is that correct? \n \nCheyenne Pasquale: \nYes, it can help to support that.  This legislation specifically also provides an opportunity for \nthe Division to explore other funding mechanisms. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 29, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there other questions from Committee members before I go to testimony in support, \nopposition, or neutral?  [There were none.]  At this time, we will begin with testimony in \nsupport of A.B. 344. \n \nGillian Block, representing Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers: \nI am speaking in support of A.B. 344.  The Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada and \nWashoe Legal Services serve older persons and vulnerable persons, providing representation \nto seniors and adults with disabilities who are facing or who are under guardianship, to \nensure  the  adult's  legal  rights  are  protected.    We  support  increasing  opportunities  for \ncollaboration between hospital staff and caregivers to coordinate health care and social \nservices for older persons and persons with a disability such as our guardianship clients.   \nCare coordination programs can help to improve continuity of care, improve outcomes, and \nprovide smooth transitions home for people who are most vulnerable and in need of ongoing \nsupport. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIs there another caller in support?  [There were none.]  Do we have any callers in opposition?  \n[There were none.]  Is there anyone testifying in neutral?  [There were none.]  I will turn this \nback over to Assemblywoman Thomas for any closing remarks. \n \nAssemblywoman Thomas: \nThank you, Chair Nguyen, and Committee.  I am hoping that you will support A.B. 344.  It is \nnecessary; it is a good program for the most elderly persons in our communities and those \nwith disabilities. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThank you for that presentation.  I will close testimony on A.B. 344 and go to public \ncomment. \n \nTom Wellman, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \nI am a resident of Assembly District 1.  I successfully retired from the Clark County School \nDistrict and currently serve as president of the Nevada State Education Association-Retired \nprogram (NSEA-R).  I am here to make public comment about a very serious issue—the \nretirees in the state of Nevada and our retired members' health care.  One of the major \nexpenses all senior citizens and our members face in retirement is the continuing escalating \ncost of health care.  Retirees who live in rural Nevada also face the additional burden of \naccessibility to quality health care because it requires them to drive over two hours or more \nto see a doctor or go to a hospital.  Any measure that can be put in place to help curb this \nrunaway train is greatly appreciated. The NSEA-R is asking that along with everything else \nyou are faced with, you make access to retiree health care a priority and address the rising \ncost  of  medication.    However,  please  keep  in  mind  that  Nevada  is  a  WEP  [Windfall \nElimination Provision] and GPO [Government Pension Offset] state, and many of our retired \nmembers who desperately need this assistance may not qualify for access to either social \nsecurity or Medicare.  Please consider as you move forward that active educators and support \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 29, 2021 \nPage 27 \n \nprofessionals will also need to have access to quality affordable health care when they retire.  \nWorking together, we can help solve this problem for the employees who continue to handle \nthese life-changing assignments on a daily basis. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there other callers for public comment?

(BDR 40-98) \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 31, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nAssemblywoman Lesley E. Cohen, Assembly District No. 29 \nPresenting with me is Mr. Trey Delap from Group Six Partners.  Mr. Delap has worked in \nbehavioral health addiction and recovery policy for years and specializes in advocating in the \nspaces where they converge, so I am going to turn this over to Mr. Delap. \n \nTrey Delap, Director, Group Six Partners: \nMy role is to update on the state of affairs with regard to some statistics that are relevant to \nthis population of young Nevadans [Exhibit C].  I want to talk about what has happened in \n2020,  which  was  the  largest  year  for  overdose  deaths  Nevada  has  seen  so  far.    The \npreliminary data for 2020 show opioid-related overdose deaths increased by 27 percent over \nthe prior year to the highest single-year number of fatalities since 2010 for all age groups.  \nFifty-one percent of these deaths are attributable to synthetic opioids like fentanyl.  Fentanyl \nis 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine.  Preliminary \ndata show the number of unintentional opioid overdose deaths in 2020 was twice as high as \nthe previous peak of four deaths in 2015.  Between 2010 and 2019, the average annual \nnumber of opioid overdose deaths among the 8 to 17 age group was 1.7.  In 2020 alone, these \neight deaths represent a 371-percent increase over the average established over the past \ndecade.  \n \nNevada's youth are at higher risk of opioid overdose death rate because 18.5 percent of \nNevada high school seniors reported using prescription pain killers that were not prescribed \nto them, in comparison to the same age group in neighboring states, including 9.6 percent in \nUtah  and  14.8  percent  in  Arizona.    Nonmedical  forms  of  these  prescriptions  are \nmanufactured nefariously and often include a blend of various substances including fentanyl.  \nSeizures  of  these  illicitly  manufactured  drugs  have  increased  117  percent,  according to \nNevada HIDTA [High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas].  The combination of increased \nsupply of highly potent synthetic opioids indistinguishably and deliberately manufactured to \nappear like other medications, and a higher rate of use, accounts for an increased risk of \nopioid deaths.  That risk has shown to be realized as the data show when broken down from \n2010 to 2020.  The dramatic rise in overdose deaths among 8- to 17-year-olds has lowered \nthe median age of unintentional opioid overdose deaths from 49 years to 29 years in a single \nyear. \n \nSubstantial federal dollars have been granted to states to promote harm-reduction strategies \ninclusive of the wide distribution of naloxone to lay persons.  State-targeted response grants \nhave been distributed to states to expand access to naloxone.  Nevada has distributed over \n16,000 doses of naloxone since February 2018.  There is hope for young people in recovery.  \nFor  young  people  with  addictive  disorders,  there  is  hope  at  Mission  High  School  in \nLas Vegas.  This comprehensive school is the first public high school for young people \nseeking recovery in the United States.  Fifty percent of the students there are credit-deficient.  \nOne hundred percent have used alcohol or drugs; 38 percent have been involved with the \njustice system.  At Mission High School, students are surrounded by peer, community, and \nsupportive adults, giving them their best chance of recovery from addiction occurring so \nearly in their lives.   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 31, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nThis  bill  would  expand  access  to  naloxone  to  more  people,  therefore  increasing  the \nopportunity that overdoses may be reversed.  The key here is that the synthetic opioids are so \npotent that the risk is so much greater.  That is why this bill is very important. \n \nAssemblywoman Cohen: \nThe federal government, in an effort to stop the health crisis that has been escalating, has \nbeen giving out the opioid antagonist to prevent overdoses.  This is without qualification.  In \nother words, the medication is safe and can be given without harm, and this is confirmed by \nthe following organizations:  the Nevada Osteopathic Medical Association, which provided \nan exhibit for today's hearing in the form of a letter [Exhibit D]; the National Association of \nSchool  Nurses;  and  the  Substance  Abuse  and  Mental  Health  Services  Administration \n(SAMHSA) of the United States Department of Health and Human Services.  According to \nthe Nevada Osteopathic Medical Association, naloxone—Narcan—is a safe and effective \ndrug for the treatment of suspected opioid overdoses.  In the event the drug is administered to \na person who is not experiencing a narcotic overdose but other medical event, it will not \ncause harm.  To be clear, if someone is overdosing from opioids, they will die without \nintervention.    But  often,  lives  are  lost  while  waiting  for  the  ambulance  to  arrive,  and \nnaloxone administered while waiting for an ambulance saves lives.  At the same time, \nnaloxone is safe and more benign than epinephrine.  In fact, if it is administered to someone \nwho is not overdosing, it does not harm them. \n \nYesterday, I distributed to Committee members a typical naloxone kit from Partnership \nCarson City.  With money from the federal government, the Nevada State Opioid Response \nreports they have distributed 13,185 kits and there have been 932 reversals from the use of \nnaloxone—reversal meaning someone is overdosing, is given the naloxone, and it basically \nsaves them.  That is 932 Nevadans who would have died if they had not received naloxone.  \nIf you look at the kits, there are gloves, there is some information about opioids, instructions, \nand a couple of naloxone sprays.  As you can tell from the kit, you do not have to have \ntraining to save someone's life; however, organizations such as Partnership Carson City \nprovide free monthly training.  The training takes from 30 minutes to 1 hour, depending on \nthe length of time for questions.  In that training, the administration of naloxone takes up \nabout 10 minutes.  The training also stresses calling for medical help.  Even though I am \nmentioning a Carson City organization, every county has an organization that will provide \nthese kits free to the public and training upon request. \n \nThere is a problem in that the rate of our students who are overdosing on opioids and using \nopioids is rising.  There is a way to solve it, which is using the naloxone or the opioid \nantagonist.  That way to solve it does not cause harm if you accidentally give the naloxone to \nsomeone who is not overdosing.  It does not harm them, so there is something we can do \nabout it.  We can prevent the skyrocketing numbers of unintentional overdoses we have seen.  \nThat is a 300-percent rise in numbers, so we definitely want to address this issue.  This bill is \na way to address this issue, so let me go through the bill with you. \n \nWe already have laws that authorize specific medical professionals to prescribe and dispense \nopioid antagonists to anyone at risk of an overdose or to another person who might assist \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 31, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nsomeone with an overdose.  We also have a law allowing for auto-injectable epinephrine in \nschools for treatment of anaphylaxis.  This bill allows for the opioid antagonists to be in our \nschools.   \n \nSection 1 allows a health care professional authorized to prescribe an opioid antagonist to \nissue to a public or private school an order for an opioid antagonist for treatment of an \nopioid-related drug overdose.  That section also provides information that is required in the \norder to the professional who is providing the antagonist.  The section also includes that the \nhealth care professional is not liable for an error or omission related to that order which is not \ngross negligence or reckless, willful, or wanton conduct. \n \nSection 2 authorizes a school nurse or other designated employee of a public or private \nschool who has received training in the storage and administration of opioid antagonists to \nadminister it to anyone on the premises of the school who is reasonably believed to be \nexperiencing an opioid-related drug overdose.  As you can see in that section, it is adding \nopioid-antagonist language to the auto-injectable epinephrine language for having those in \nschools. \n \nSection 3 is conforming language in the maintenance and administration of auto-injectable \nepinephrine statutes.  Section 4 establishes requirements related to the storage, handling, and \ntransportation of opioid antagonists in public schools and requires each school district and \ncharter school to report to the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services the number of doses of opioid antagonists administered at each \npublic school during each school year.  This language is duplicative of the auto-injectable \nepinephrine language. \n \nSections 5 and 8 require the board of trustees of each school district and the governing bodies \nof each charter school or private school that obtains an order for an opioid antagonist to \nestablish  a  policy  to  ensure  that  emergency  assistance  is  sought  each  time  a  person \nexperiences an opioid-related drug overdose on the premises of the school and the parent or \nguardian of a pupil to whom an opioid antagonist is administered is notified as soon as \npracticable.  Sections 5 through 8 of the bill require training in the storage and administration \nof opioid antagonists to be provided to designated employees of the public or private school \nthat obtains an order for an opioid antagonist.  Again, schools do not have to do this, but if \nthey do, there are guidelines they have to follow.  Section 5, subsection 2, and section 8, \nsubsection  2,  are  clear  that  the  schools  may  obtain  opioid  antagonists;  this  is  not  a \nrequirement.  It is a \"may\" and not a \"must.\"   \n \nSections 5 and 8 additionally exempt a school, school district, employee of a school, and \ncertain other persons affiliated with the school from liability for certain damages related to \nthe acquisition, possession, provision, or administration of auto-injectable epinephrine or an \nopioid antagonist not amounting to gross negligence or reckless, willful, or wanton conduct.  \nI am working with a stakeholder on this, and you will probably hear from them.  We want to \nclarify what these protections are and that the protections apply only in an emergency \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 31, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nsituation.  We are still working on that, but we are very close.  We are in agreement; it is just \ngetting the language. \n \nSection 9 requires a registered pharmacist to transfer an order for an opioid antagonist to \nanother registered pharmacist at the request of the public or private school for which the \norder was issued.  That same section exempts pharmacists who dispense an opioid antagonist \npursuant to the order from liability for certain damages related to the acquisition, possession, \nprovision, or administration of an opioid antagonist not amounting to gross negligence or \nreckless,  willful,  or  wanton  conduct.    Again,  this  is  duplicative  of  the  auto-injectable \nepinephrine language.  Section 10 is the effective date.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe have quite a few questions. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank you for bringing back my bill.  This was a bill I presented in 2019, and I have to give \ncredit to former Assemblyman Hambrick who initially presented the bill.  Trey Delap and \nI worked hard on this bill.  We got it across the finish line through both houses and then it sat \non a desk and died, so I am glad you brought it back.  I appreciate that, but I definitely \nwanted to give credit to Assemblyman Hambrick.  This was one of his priority legislations. \n \nWe were getting ahead of the opioid epidemic and the overdose deaths until this pandemic \nshowed us where we were really lacking.  This surge is real.  Hopefully, the members of \nthis Committee will support this.  It was pretty well vetted.  This bill is very similar to the \none in 2019.   \n \nA previous concern brought up during multiple testimonies was the availability of Narcan.  \nThis is a nasal spray, unlike the EpiPen, the auto-inject, where there is a syringe involved.  \nAs Assemblywoman Cohen pointed out, there is zero risk.  That was one of the other \nconcerns in previous testimony, how do you know for sure if you use it?  Well, we testified \nthat there was really no harm to give it.  You have an unconscious person.  We give glucose \nin case they are diabetic, or you give them Narcan and see if they wake up.  There were \nalways worries about the shot and availability, so has the supply increased now?  Can we \nadequately supply everybody with Narcan? \n \nAssemblywoman Cohen: \nI would like to address something before Mr. Delap answers.  I want to be clear about the \nhistory of what happened last session.  Certainly, this is Assemblyman Hambrick's bill, and \nI promised him I would bring it back.  It did not sit on a desk and die; it was basically really \ngetting watered down to the point that it did not seem that it would have any effectiveness.  \nThat is why I said to him that if he would agree, I would bring it back because we wanted it \nto be effective. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 31, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nTrey Delap: \nYour question was about the available supply of nasal naloxone.  That is something I would \nhave  to  check,  but  this  preparation  of  it  does  not  require  needles.    This  is  the  nasal \nadministration spray; this is what is given to the lay public.  I would envision that this is the \nmost appropriate delivery system.  This nasal spray eliminates the needle fear and worry \nconcerned with that.  Naloxone has been around and proven safe since 1971.  Thousands of \ndoses have been distributed to the public.  If the question were whether we would have \nenough to put some in every school, I am confident that we could. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nWhen we heard this in the past, there were volunteers, some funds, and lots of grants for the \nschools because this comes with a cost.  Is that funding still available so that agencies and \nschools that wanted to get this could have some assistance?  Also, is there any agreement on \nthe shelf life and return of unused packets? \n \nAssemblywoman Cohen: \nReferring to cost, we need to keep in mind that this is a policy committee, but also this is not \nobligatory.  For the schools, it is a \"may.\"  There are some federal funds, but that is not really \nthe point of the bill.  We want to get something in place.  If a school decides they want to do \nthis, they will get the materials.  They will get the sprays.   \n \nTrey Delap: \nThe naloxone distributed to the community is paid for by the federal government, and I find \nthat to be a very compelling note for two reasons:  one, federal grant dollars are being used to \nbuy a medication to give to the lay public for the administration to people who may need it.  \nThat  is  a  key  detail.    All  the  doses  we  have  mentioned  have  been  dispensed  to  the \ncommunity, the state, and all have been paid for by a variety of grant sources from the \nfederal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.  The Opioid STR [state \ntargeted response] Grant was a major chunk of money that came into the state for the \ndistribution of it.  There are a number of resources that have dashboards and data.  Covering \nthe cost of the product was probably the easiest part to solve.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nOur policy analyst might be able to clarify that this is not an unfunded mandate because of \nthe \"may\" language. \n \nMegan Comlossy, Principal Policy Analyst: \nIt is enabling language so school districts or a school would choose to participate in the \nprogram.  What was said before is accurate.  There are lots of sources for federal funds for \nthese types of naloxone kits, and they are being distributed widely.  It may even work for a \nschool or school district to work with local nonprofits or local community organizations to \nobtain naloxone. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 31, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nAssemblyman Hafen: \nMy question was regarding the fiscal notes that were attached and the conversation we are \njust having that the feds were paying for it.  I know this is enabling language; however, I am \nstill confused.  Are we putting enabling language so the schools can obtain federally paid \nantagonists? \n \nAssemblywoman Cohen: \nTo be clear, the fiscal note is zero.  We are allowing the schools to obtain the naloxone, to \nhave it in the schools, and to use it if they choose to have someone at the school trained to \nuse it, which is a very short training session and not extremely technical.  If the schools \n\"choose.\"  It is not that we are saying they can get the money from the feds; we are saying \nthey can do this and we are saying that the feds have been distributing and providing funds \nfor the kits, but they are not correlated. \n \nAssemblyman Hafen: \nIt was not the fiscal note from the state; however, it was from local governments.  The Clark \nCounty School District is showing roughly $182,000 over the biennium, and a number of \nother school districts are also showing fiscal impacts to this.  I understand we are trying to \nget help from the feds, and I think this is a good program, but I wanted to get on the record \nthat there are fiscal notes from local municipalities. \n \nAssemblywoman Cohen: \nI am not seeing those.  I am only privy to what is on the Nevada Electronic Legislative \nInformation System (NELIS) for the public.  I am not seeing anything from the school \ndistricts.  Oh, there they are.  However, I would just remind you again, as Ms. Comlossy said, \nthis is enabling language so they can choose to do this or not.  They can choose to do it and \npay for it; they can choose to do it and find other resources to pay for it, but they will choose \nwhether or not to do it. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nI am looking at the fiscal note and it looks as though there is some confusion from the school \ndistricts as to accessibility of resources and the need for training.  I would encourage that a \nletter be sent to them letting them know where they can find this.  My question has to do with \naccessibility.  In thinking about 16- and 17-year-olds I know, some of them are incredibly \ncapable people.  With the prevalence of the supply, is there anything that inhibits a student \nfrom administering something like this at their school?  If it is available to the public, what is \nthe importance of having the enabling of the health care professional language in the bill? \n \nAssemblywoman Cohen: \nTo your first point, in case any districts are watching and interested, in March there was a \ngrant announced by the federal government.  It is on the SAMHSA page with information \nabout how to get a grant for the kits.  What were your other questions?   \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 31, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nIt was about students potentially having a kit in a backpack.  Because they are careful and \nthoughtful  people,  can  they  administer  that  on  school  property?    My  other  question \nconcerned the importance of having the enabling language for health care professionals \nspelled out.  What is the purpose of that? \n \nAssemblywoman Cohen: \nFrom what I know about this, students probably could do it, but this bill does not allow for it.  \nThat would have to be done by a different vehicle.  The bill is for an employee in the school \nto be trained to do it.  Maybe we can ask Ms. O'Krent why that language is in there.  The bill \nvery much follows the existing epinephrine language about the prescriber, and I think the bill \ndrafters thought it was necessary.  Also, because it is going to a school, maybe that is why we \nneeded to specifically say that it is okay for the prescribers to prescribe it.   \n \nKarly O'Krent, Committee Counsel: \nThat is precisely it.  As this bill was originally drafted, that section tracks the epinephrine \nstatutes and so required the training that was required for epinephrine.  It is certainly not a \nrequirement that the bill maintain that same training requirement [unintelligible] for this \nlegislative process but that is why it was drafted that way. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nThat makes sense.  I was curious about the availability of Narcan.  I have a box of it at my \nhouse that I was intending to take to an event this summer, so I know it is available.  I think it \nis important to understand whether students can administer this on school grounds if they \nhave it available or whether there is liability associated with that.  It sounds like that is a \nseparate issue from what we are talking about today, so I can clarify later. \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nWhat would it look like if someone were overdosing?  If I am at the grocery store, a mall, or \nin a park and someone falls over, I am not so sure this would have been my first thought—to \ngrab a Narcan and administer it.  What might some of the symptoms be for someone who is \noverdosing? \n \nAssemblywoman Cohen: \nThat is part of the required training.  Mr. Delap, you told me a story about someone who was \noverdosing. \n \nTrey Delap: \nThis would look like a variety of things.  The training basically says if you encounter \nsomeone who is unresponsive—not conscious or in and out of consciousness; they may not \nbe able to talk; they are difficult to rouse—the protocol would be to call 9-1-1 or activate \nEMS [emergency medical services].  If you have the nasal-administered Narcan, you would \nopen it.  The instructions about how to use it are in the package, and you would administer it.  \nNarcan is very effective only if someone has opioids on board, period.  It has been described \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 31, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nas a Lazarus drug.  It does one thing; blocks the effect of the opioid, so the person will \nimmediately reverse.   \n \nOne case that got some media coverage was a highway trooper in the middle of nowhere.  A \nperson riding a bus was overdosing and unresponsive, so the bus driver pulled over.  The first \nresponder was a highway trooper who had just gotten his training on Narcan.  His body cam \nfootage shows the entire encounter.  He was attempting to talk to the person, but the person \nwas unresponsive.  They did a sternum rub, but he was unable to rouse.  They took him off \nthe bus; someone was doing CPR [cardiopulmonary resuscitation] and rescue breathing.  \nThen the trooper remembered his Narcan and administered it.  In the meantime, the trooper \nhad called for a medivac helicopter, so a helicopter was coming.  He administered the Narcan \nand the patient woke up.  This is critically important, especially to communities where help is \nnot five minutes away.  In Las Vegas, you might call an ambulance and two ambulances are \ngoing to show up within five minutes, but in other parts of the world that may not happen. \n \nThe major piece of legislation that passed in 2015 was the Good Samaritan Drug Overdose \nAct, which created NRS Chapter 453C.  Its intent was to protect individuals who would \nadminister this to others.  The thing in the balance is the life of the person, and the intent of \nthat bill is to relieve any hesitancy in that.  Assemblywoman Titus mentioned that sometimes \nin a clinical setting, this is used as an assessment tool:  if they administer Narcan and there is \nno change in the patient's condition, it is something else, but if it does change the patient's \ncondition,  it  shows  there  were  drugs  on  board.    It  would  look  like  someone  who  is \nunresponsive—maybe breathing, maybe not.  The critical detail with this, and why the spike \nhas been so bad, is the fact that the synthetic opioid with fentanyl is so tiny.  When you look \nat the data from 2020, there was one death of a 14-year-old or younger.  All eight of the \ndeaths we talked about from 2020 were unintentional overdoses.  That means someone was \ntaking something and it overwhelmed their system.  That is a key detail. \n \nAnother example was brought up.  There is a computer program called \"ODMAP\" [Overdose \nDetection Mapping Application Program] that tracks the use of naloxone by EMS.  If there \nare a number of reports in a specific area, that triggers an alert.  Now you know there is a \nbatch of fentanyl-laced stuff in a particular area and overdoses are going to start happening.  \nFrom a surveillance perspective, that is critical information, so the administration of Narcan \nis an indicator that opioid overdoses are occurring.  That indicator prompts a stronger public \nresponse.  \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any more questions?  [There were none.]  We will go to callers in support of \nA.B. 205. \n \nJoseph Heck, representing Nevada Osteopathic Medical Association: \nOn behalf of the Nevada Osteopathic Medical Association, I voice our strong support for \nA.B. 205.  We have provided a more complete statement for the record that is available on \nNELIS [Exhibit D].  While all attention has been fixated on the COVID-19 pandemic, we \ncannot lose sight of other public health crises which include the opioid epidemic that is \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 31, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nplaguing our nation and state, and the isolation and depression associated with COVID-19 \nmitigation measures.  That is why we applaud Assemblywoman Cohen's efforts to make \nnaloxone—trade name Narcan—readily accessible in schools across Nevada.  This safe \nantidote has proven effective in saving lives when administered by lay persons.  Taking the \nsame approach as the Legislature did when making epinephrine auto-injectors available in \nschools is a logical and much-needed next step in combating opioid overdoses.  We urge its \nswift passage. \n \nKendra  G.  Bertschy,  Deputy  Public  Defender,  Washoe  County  Public  Defender's \nOffice; also representing Clark County Public Defender's Office: \nOn behalf of my office as well as the Clark County Public Defender's Office, we want to \nthank Assemblywoman Cohen, as well as Mr. Delap, for bringing forward this important bill.  \nWe hope and believe that this will save lives, especially the lives of our children.  So we \nappreciate this effort. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nCould we go to our next callers in support?  [There were none.]  Are there any callers in \nopposition to A.B. 205?  [There were none.]  We will begin testimony in neutral at this time. \n \nJamie Ross, Executive Director, PACT Coalition: \nI work in substance misuse prevention.  We have free Narcan in our naloxone trainings at our \nagency.  With the increase of illicitly manufactured fentanyl in our drug supply in Nevada, \nour concern is the increase in fatal overdoses of children under 18 that occurred in 2020.  \nMost of the fentanyl seen in Nevada is in fake pressed pills that cannot be differentiated from \npharmacy-manufactured  pills.    Youth  who  may  not  use  heroin  but  perceive  a  pill  of \noxycodone to be safer than heroin would not be able to tell that this pill had fentanyl in it.  \nThe goal is to decrease overdoses and increase access to naloxone.  It is a safe and effective \nway to do that.  There is currently a grant open through SAMHSA's First Responders-\nComprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act for funding for additional naloxone.   \n \nLindsay Anderson, Government Affairs Director, Washoe County School District: \nWe are testifying in neutral today because of the enabling nature of this legislation and \nwanted to provide some context for the Committee's consideration.  Currently, our school \npolice officers carry these kits through a grant at the Office of the Attorney General.  We \nhave a school police officer at every high school campus and share them among the middle \nand elementary schools.  We have less than 40 school nurses and more than 100 school \ncampuses.  Our clinical aides at each school do not have medical training.  Asking them to \ndecide among administering Narcan, epinephrine, an automated external defibrillator (AED), \nor  other  tools  at  their  disposal,  to  an  unresponsive  individual  is  a  great  responsibility.  \nWe have not had a documented opioid overdose case on school campus in the recent past.  \nI know this is a policy committee, but at least last session, the bill did not go to the Assembly \nWays and Means Committee.  I would hope that this session we may get an opportunity to \ndiscuss the potential fiscal impact in Ways and Means, if necessary. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 31, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nBrad Keating, representing Clark County School District: \nWe are calling in a neutral capacity on this bill because this is a policy committee.  I wanted \nto pass along a few important facts for the Committee to know.  Assembly Bill 205 is \nproposing to have schools acquire and maintain storage and provide training to licensed and \nunlicensed employees to recognize the signs and symptoms of an opioid overdose and then to \naccurately  administer  an  opioid  antagonist  while  monitoring  the  student's  response.  \nUnlicensed, assistive personnel at schools are often reluctant to be trained in administering \ninjections, particularly during a medical emergency when there are varying circumstances to \nconsider, and careful ongoing monitoring of the student needs to take place. \n \nAlso,  the  current  basic  life  support  guidelines  recommend  an  AED  be  available  when \nadministering  an  opioid  antagonist.    Automated  external  defibrillators  are  only  in  high \nschools and administrative buildings in the Clark County School District; therefore, they \nwould be the only sites equipped to manage an opioid overdose.  Administration of those \nopioid antagonists would not be safe to administer in elementary and middle schools without \nthe proper emergency equipment available, including AEDs.   Again, this is a policy decision \nby the Legislature, and the Clark County School District is testifying in neutral and wanted to \nprovide you with those facts as you make a decision on this bill. \n \nHawah Ahmad, representing Clark County Education Association: \nThe Clark County Education Association is the official bargaining partner for the Clark \nCounty School District and represents more than 18,000 licensed professionals, including \nschool nurses, counselors, psychologists, and social workers.  The Clark County Education \nAssociation is testifying in neutral on A.B. 205.  We appreciate the intent of the bill, but we \ndo have questions on the policies for administration and notice that may potentially be given \nto parents, and we are concerned about the implementation date being so soon, with our \ncurrent retention issues for teachers and licensed professionals.  This is not to say that we are \nnot supportive of the intent of the bill.  It is completely necessary, and we do believe it will \npositively impact our students, especially our students struggling with opioid addiction.   \n \nWe  ask  that  the  members  on  this  Committee  who  are  also  on  the  Ways  and  Means \nCommittee consider payment for the opioid antagonists from the Attorney General's opioid \nsettlement funds or a request that the Office of Grant Procurement pay special attention to the \nSAMHSA funds.  We look forward to working with the sponsor to ensure implementation of \nthe bill is impactful and prevents all unnecessary deaths caused by opioid overdoses.  We are \nalso looking forward to ensuring that this does not take money away from our classrooms.  \nWe are very thankful to the sponsor for stimulating discussion on this topic and bringing this \nbill forward. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI  will  remind  those  testifying  in  support,  opposition,  and  neutral  that  this  is  a  policy \ncommittee, so if you have concerns with some of these other issues, I suggest you bring them \nup with the bill's sponsor or in our money committees.  Do we have any other callers in \nneutral?  [There were none.]  At this time, I will turn this back over to Assemblywoman \nCohen for any closing remarks.  \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 31, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nAssemblywoman Cohen: \nMr. Delap, would you like to make any closing statements? \n \nTrey Delap: \nThank you for the opportunity to talk about this.  For as long as we have had awareness that \nopioid overdose is a public health issue, we have been working on a number of fronts.  This \nis a piece of a much wider public health effort that involves how prescriptions are written and \nhow much the prescription monitoring program is used.  When we use the example of the lay \nperson administering the naloxone, that is the expectation.  It is the intent of the Good \nSamaritan Drug Overdose Act to protect people to encourage that kind of activity.  There are \na number of schools, and the National Association of School Nurses offers a number of \nresources in designing proper school policy.  One I found was with the Albuquerque Public \nSchools that had a policy and they cited their Good Samaritan law as the rationale for that.   \n \nWith regard to the implementation and how it might mesh with other policies, this one is \ninteresting and nuanced in that we are educating the lay public with no medical training and \nno obligation to administer this drug.  If they do it and the person does not need it, there is no \nconsequence.  I do not know of any other medication or substance that has been publicly \nfunded for mass distribution.  One thing about the expiration date, for example, is that the \nFDA [Food and Drug Administration] has extended the expiration for three years, so now \nthey are good for three years instead of one year.  Where it might be deployed in a school, \nI think there are a number of resources that can work with that, because there are school \ndistricts and states that have done this successfully.   \n \nThe policy brief done by the Nevada Institute for Children's Research and Policy indicated \nthat  a  survey  of  school  nurses  showed  that  only  5.2  percent  of  school  nurses  ever \nadministered naloxone.  If that 5 percent did, that means there was one less student's life lost.  \nIf we have the opportunity to do that, that is very valuable.  Also, the education about opioid \nuse and especially the extreme prevalence of the synthetic opioids are very compelling to \nsome sort of action.  This is a dynamic process.  There are a lot of community partners \ninvolved in this who have done a lot of work.  The Legislature has done a lot of work.  There \nare a lot of resources and stitching that together is something we can certainly do.  I would be \nwilling to have a conversation or work out the details, as far as what the expectations are with \nthis particular intervention.  Again, this is so important.  I want to emphasize the final detail \nhere is the tremendous spike—eight in Clark County between the ages of 8 and 17 in one \nyear.  The peak was four, so it is a huge spike.  Also, 27 percent statewide of unintentional \noverdoses of the synthetic opioid, so we have a greater risk with these substances.  I really do \nthink we should do as much as we possibly can to overcome whatever barriers there are.  \nI know that the autoinjector bill had some barriers and took some time, but we do not have a \nlot of time, when we see such a profound impact in a single year.  Thank you for considering \nthis legislation. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI would like to understand some of the neutral comments by the school districts related to \ncost.  I was trying to identify where in the bill those concerns about cost originated.  Also, \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 31, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nsomeone had a concern about the implementation date.  I also heard mention of this bill \ngoing to the Committee on Ways and Means which is not practical because we only send \nthings to Ways and Means that are under the purview of the state's budget, and this is not.  \nObviously, their budgets are their budgets, but I wanted to hone in on the bill a little more \nconcerning where they thought specific costs were coming from.  In looking at Washoe \nCounty, I did the math and it looked like $150 each to get the naloxone into 120 schools, but \nI  do  not  see  anything  in  the  bill  language  that  says  that.    Clark  County  talks  about \n\"indeterminant\" costs, and I am seeing different levels of response to the bill, so it would be \nhelpful to know I am reading the bill the same way they are. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWe are trying to get them back on the line, but I do not know if we are going to be able to.  \nI believe Assemblywoman Cohen can probably answer some of these questions.  I know she \nhas had conversations with them.  \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nIt is fine for the school districts to give us that information.  It is their argument to make, but \nI think that would be helpful information for them to get to the Committee.  If they could just \ncite the specific section that is causing the fiscal impact, if they could help us understand the \nthinking behind that number, that would be helpful for me.  That way we do not have to wait \nfor them to come back on the line. \n \nAssemblywoman Cohen: \nI will just wrap up.  The mention of the Ways and Means Committee was my mistake, and \nI think they were just following along with what I had said.  However, I want to address a \nfew things that were said that I have found to be an issue and kind of confusing from the \nparties who were in neutral.  \n \nWe have heard that there are not nurses in every school and the aides do not have any \nmedical training.  Well, you do not need medical training to do this.  You just need the \ntraining that is offered for free and is available online, so that should not be an issue.  Also, \nsomeone mentioned the bill should address that the funds are going to come from the \nAttorney General's opioid settlement funds.  My understanding is that those are not our funds \nto play with; they are the Attorney General's, so that is not relevant.  On top of that, another \nthing I want to address and stress is that this is enabling language.  School districts do not \nhave to do this if they do not want to.  I hope that if we pass this bill, they will see their way \nclear to wanting to do this.  Also, I am getting a message from a doctor that there was a \nmisrepresentation by the Clark County School District of the need for the AED with use of \nNarcan [Exhibit E].  There is no need for there to be an AED as part of the emergency \nresponse kit with Narcan.  It is my understanding that these are two separate treatments and \ntwo different problems.  If a person is unconscious or unresponsive, without a pulse, an AED \nis the first intervention that should be applied, but they do not necessarily have to be done \ntogether.   \n \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 31, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nI will also reiterate what Mr. Delap mentioned.  When medical professionals do not know \nwhat is wrong with someone, they will give them the Narcan first because, again, it does not \nhurt them.  So if they are in anaphylactic shock, and you give the Narcan, it does not hurt \nthem.    The  reverse  is  if  that  person  is  overdosing,  and  you  give  the  medication  for \nanaphylactic shock, that can harm them, and that is something to keep in mind.  I will \ncertainly keep working with the school districts and try to get them to a place where they are \nwanting to do this.  I will also provide more information about the AEDs to clarify that.  \nWith that, I thank you very much for the hearing. \n    \nChair Nguyen: \nI will reach out to the people who testified in neutral and have them try to address those \nissues and get that information to the Committee for your consideration.  With that, I will \nclose the hearing on A.B. 205. \n \n[Exhibit F was submitted but not discussed and will become part of the record.] \n \nWe will now open up the hearing on Assembly Bill 287.   Welcome, Assemblywoman \nMonroe-Moreno. \n \nAssembly Bill 287:  Providing for the licensing and regulating of freestanding birthing \ncenters. (BDR 40-799) \n \nAssemblywoman Daniele Monroe-Moreno, Assembly District No. 1: \n[Assemblywoman Monroe-Moreno submitted a proposed amendment Exhibit G.]  I am here \ntoday to present for your consideration Assembly Bill 287.  Joining me here today is Dr. Tara \nRaines, Ms. April Clyde, owner of Serenity Birth Center in Las Vegas, and Ms. Genevieve \nBurkett, Director of Nursing at Serenity Birth Center.  During the 80th Legislative Session, \nI presented, and this body passed with an overwhelming majority Assembly Bill 169 of the \n80th Legislative Session, which established the Maternal Mortality Review Committee.  It \nwas important to pass that legislation because maternal mortality was, and still is, rising in \nthe U.S. as it is declining in other countries.  Sadly, we continue to be the only high-resource \ncountry whose rates are rising.  Black women face significantly higher maternal mortality \nrisk, currently at 44 deaths per 100,000 of live births, compared to their white counterparts \nand women of other races who are at 13 to 14 per every 100,000 live births.  But that was last \nsession, and this is 2021.  We are still battling maternal mortality, it is still an issue, but it is \nan issue while we are battling COVID-19.  During the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis, \npregnant people were often forced to deliver in hospitals alone without their partners or \nfamily members.  That was important because it was for the safety and protection of the \nhospital staff and other patients.  While I do not disagree with the decision that was made, \nI do understand the stress it caused for families.  I understand that because I had a number of \nconstituents reach out to me and ask why we did not have more options to have healthy \nbabies  where  families  could  be  involved,  thus  A.B.  287.    Madam  Chair,  with  your \npermission, I would like to share a short three-minute video that can explain what a birthing \ncenter is much better than I can [Exhibit H].  Families in my community, and I am sure, in \nyours, are looking for healthy options, and I believe free-standing birth centers are one of \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 31, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nthose options.  Assembly Bill 287 simply defines, in Nevada statute, what a free-standing \nbirthing  center  is.    Now,  I  will  turn  the  remainder  of  this  presentation  over  to  my \ncopresenters. \n \nTara Raines, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \n[Tara Raines presented a PowerPoint explaining birth centers Exhibit I.]  I would like to talk \nabout birth centers, the rise of birth centers in the United States, some outcomes associated \nwith birth centers, projected cost savings related to birth centers, and ways in which they \naddress disparities.  As was explained in the video, birth centers can be considered more a \nmaxi-home than a mini-hospital [page 3].  They are a safe place for birthing people and their \nfamilies to have babies, receive prenatal care, and then receive postpartum support.  The \nmajor  tenets  of  birth  centers  are  prevention,  sensitivity,  safety,  appropriate  medical \nintervention, and cost effectiveness [page 4].  Birth centers are centered in the midwifery \nmodel of care which by its nature is relationally oriented.  Birth centers respect and facilitate \nbirthing persons' rights to make informed choices about their health care based on their \nvalues and their beliefs.  Birth centers allow birthing people to define \"family\" as they see fit, \nand also allow them to have family members present during their labor and delivery [page 5].   \n \nThe proliferation of birth centers is on the rise.  Currently, particularly in the wake of \nCOVID-19, we have seen an increased number of birth centers [page 6].  There are currently \n384 free-standing birth centers in the United States; there are none in Nevada [page 7].  \nThere is one birth center on the brink of opening; however, because there has been no \ndefinition, there have been some struggles and my copresenters will speak more about those.  \nOf all U.S. births, birth centers make up a little less than 1 percent.  This data has been \nupdated by the American Association of Birth Centers (AABC), and it is now a little more \nthan 1 percent, which is a 200-percent increase in births in the last ten years.   \n \nWe know the outcomes associated with birth centers include lower rates of cesarean sections, \ncost savings, and increased client satisfaction [page 8].  As previously mentioned, the U.S. \ncurrently ranks really poorly in relation to its peers in regard to maternal mortality health \noutcomes and infant mortality outcomes [page 9].  Most notably, the racial disparities in \nthese outcomes are tremendous.  Black women are exponentially more likely not only to not \nsurvive childbirth, but to suffer severe disability following childbirth [page 10].  We know \nthere is an abundance of literature saying that implicit bias in the medical community plays \ninto this.  There have been several high-profile stories, including Serena Williams, in which \nit has become clear that in the medical community, for whatever reason, Black women's \nexplanation of their pain is not believed by providers.  Another reason why this relational \napproach, this midwifery approach, to care is so important. \n \nLooking at the value, we see that about 42 percent of births nationally are covered by \nMedicaid [page 11].  In Nevada, it is more like 60 to 70 percent of births are covered by \nMedicaid.  Birth centers are poised to save the state a tremendous amount of money, if \nnothing else, through the reduction of high intervention during birth.  Again, looking at the \ncost savings, most recently Washington, D.C., engaged in a Medicaid study to estimate about \nhow much it would save to utilize birth centers for their low-intervention Medicaid births.  \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 31, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nWhat they found was they saved around $1,163 per birth [page 12].  These numbers I am \nreporting for Nevada would not entirely be the case, and Nevada would have to do a cost \nstudy to see how much it would save the state; however, based on my estimates, with 41,233 \nbirth certificates issued just in Clark County in 2020, and if we estimated that 60 percent of \nthose births were Medicaid-funded, if every Medicaid-funded birth in Clark County went to a \nbirth center and we saved the same as Washington, D.C., it would save the state over \n$28 million.  Realistically, we know it would be closer to 1 percent of births coming to birth \ncenters, however, that would still save the state a few hundred thousand dollars just in Clark \nCounty.   \n \nWe know that if more pregnant beneficiaries use birth center services during the prenatal \nperiod for the duration of their care, they are more likely to experience better outcomes.  \nBirth center care is a high value for Medicaid beneficiaries [page 13].  Currently, only a \nsmall fraction of Medicaid beneficiaries are able to obtain birth center care and that is due to \na lack of birth centers.  The birth center model relies heavily on the Strong Start model of \ncare [page 14].  This is the use of the midwifery model in addition to group prenatal care \nwhich allows birthing persons to build relationships during that prenatal period and find that \npeer support, find a group; and it offers wraparound services, family care in-home to help \nsupport things like nutrition and lactation in those first few weeks postpartum.  Using the \nStrong Start approach, the AABC versus national data found that in a number of maternal \nand  infant  health  indicators,  the  Strong  Start  approach  was  much  more  successful  and \nproduced better outcomes [page 15, Exhibit I].  \n \nSpecifically in relation to race, I think it is important to note that using the Strong Start \nmodel with African-American birthing persons reduced the cesarean rate by more than half \n[page 16].  To close out the birth center model of care benefits, it is time-intensive, but it is \nrelationship-based.  It includes referrals to needed resources, health education, and emotional \nand mental health support.  Midwives see fewer clients per day than obstetricians (OBs) and \nas such, they are able to really connect with their clients in a different way and support these \npositive outcomes [page 17].  Incentivizing birth center use for prenatal care could result in \nlots of savings to Medicaid.  These cost savings also come in the postpartum period because \nwe know that you have better prepared parents, you have healthier breastfed/chestfed babies, \nyou have lower rates of cesareans and lower rates of interventions. \n \nI would like to tell my story [page 18].  I had two birth center deliveries in Colorado.  I had \nread the outcomes about the Black maternal health crisis and I did not feel safe going to a \nhospital.  I was not certain that would be a place where my needs would be met and my voice \nwould be heard.  I went to an OB for my initial appointment when I found out I was \npregnant.  Having a history of miscarriages, having a previous loss, the OB said to me, \n\"Okay, where you are sitting right now, it looks pretty good.  You have a 10- to 15-percent \nchance of miscarriage at this point.\"  The next day, I had an appointment with a midwife at \nthe birth center.  After I told her my story, she said, \"Knowing what we know, you are \nlooking at an 85- to 90-percent chance of having a healthy baby.\"  The difference in that \nperspective, the emphasis on the life I was growing, was what it took for me to realize that \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 31, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nhaving a birth center birth is what would make me feel like an empowered, educated, \nknowledgeable person during my delivery. \n \nA lot of these slides were taken from the AABC.  Monet Nicole Photography was kind \nenough  to  allow  us  to  use  photographs  for  this  presentation.    All  the  photos  in  this \npresentation were taken during birth center births, and I would like to thank the incredible \ncommunity of birth workers in Nevada and across the country who work to empower their \nclients, and my partner who allowed me to quit a tenured faculty position to pursue this work \nhere in Nevada. \n \nApril Clyde, Owner, Serenity Birth Center, Las Vegas, Nevada: \nI started my career at Sunrise Hospital in 1998 as a labor and delivery nurse practitioner.  The \nbirth center pictures you saw of the building and inside are of my birth center that is, \nhopefully, weeks away from opening.  I started the process, first getting laws changed and \nnow opening the center, but actively working to get the center open for the last three years.  It \nhas been such a challenging process that I do not know whether anyone following behind me, \nwithout some law changes, would be able to see it happen.  Most of that three years was \nworking through city, fire, and state agencies, and we are still working with the health \ndepartment.   \n \nAs you can see, the birth center is ready to go.  It is stocked with medical equipment.  Instead \nof using the Commission for the Accreditation of Birth Centers, a national organization that \nlicenses and accredits birth centers, think hospital—The Joint Commission that accredits \nhospitals—they are the experts in that, they do that—rather than looking toward the state and \ncity to do the licensing and accrediting.  What is left for birth centers like mine is lots of \npeople arguing and not understanding what we are, so the two closest templates that fit what \na birth center is in Nevada are an ambulatory surgery center and a nursing home.  We are \nneither of those.  We do not have people who are anesthetized, our moms are healthy, \nlow-risk women.  They are walking in in labor.  They are our existing patients.  We do not \nhave someone showing up at the door who did not have prenatal care with us.  They are \nwalking out.  We have an agreement with a collaborative physician, and University Medical \nCenter (UMC) is ten minutes away, so there is a plan. \n \nBecause there is not an understanding of this among health department officials and city \nofficials, we are being met with things that are really delaying the process and not increasing \npatient safety.  So, it is my hope that no one else has to go through the journey I have gone \nthrough because there is incredible evidence to support that freestanding birth centers and the \nmidwifery model of care increase maternal and child outcomes. \n \nGenevieve Burkett, Director of Nursing, Serenity Birth Center, Las Vegas, Nevada: \nI am a registered nurse and work for April Clyde.  Tara Raines and April Clyde have covered \nthe majority of the information.  I want to add to what Tara and April have spoken to.  The \nwebsite evidencedbasedbirths.com provides an incredible amount of research showing that \nthe midwifery model of care provides the safest and best outcomes for low-risk women.  The \nCommission for the Accreditation of Birth Centers, our soon-to-be accrediting body for \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 31, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nSerenity Birth Center, goes over an incredible amount of thorough review of birth centers \nbefore they are allowed to be accredited.  We are working on an immense amount of policies \nand procedures.  We provide training and drills in safety to all our staff who are registered \nnurses and certified nurse-midwives who are required by the state of Nevada to attend each \nbirth.  I am grateful to be a part of it and was a beneficiary of April Clyde's services as well. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAssemblywoman  Monroe-Moreno,  do  you  have  anything  else  or  should  we  ask  for \nquestions? \n \nAssemblywoman Monroe-Moreno: \nWhatever you want. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI know we have quite a few questions, and I will begin.  Thank you for bringing this bill.  \nWhen I was pregnant and looking for birthing centers in Clark County, I quickly realized \nthere were none.  Can you explain how you think the changes in this bill would allow \nbirthing centers to become more prevalent and avoid some of the regulatory confusion \nMs. Clyde has gone through? \n \nAssemblywoman Monroe-Moreno: \nI think it was explained very well by Ms. Clyde.  She has had to jump through hoops to \nadhere to provisions for a traditional medical center that she is not.  In our statutes, we did \nnot have a clear definition of what a birthing center is.  By putting that definition within our \nNevada Revised Statutes (NRS), it will make it not only easier for her, but for other people in \nour community who qualify and want to be accredited to build birthing centers and give \noptions so we can have healthy moms and healthy babies, give them options.  By making a \ndistinct definition, it will make that process much easier. \n \nAssemblyman Matthews: \nHow many other states have this licensing and regulation of birthing centers, and in the states \nthat do, is there any statistical correlation between the licensure and health outcomes? \n \nTara Raines: \nCurrently, 40 states have active birth centers, and the findings have overwhelmingly been \nthat outcomes for birth center births are better as far as prenatal satisfaction, labor and \ndelivery satisfaction, and postpartum support. \n \nAssemblyman Matthews: \nWhen you say, better, as compared to what?  Births in other circumstances or better health \noutcomes in those states in general?  Would you mind clarifying that, please? \n \nTara Raines: \nBetter in relation to their peers in hospital births.  The studies I will reference are listed at the \nend of my presentation [page 20, Exhibit I].  Many of those studies are looking at birth center \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 31, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nbirths versus hospital births or birth center prenatal support versus hospital or more typical \nprenatal support. \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nGoing through the bill, I was hoping you could clarify the difference between a freestanding \nbirthing center and an obstetric center.  Also, in section 12, subsection 2, how was that \ndistance of 30 miles to a hospital determined? \n \nGenevieve Burkett: \nA freestanding birth center is not attached to a hospital. The state of Nevada determined it \nwanted to call a freestanding birth center an obstetric center in their legislation. \n \nApril Clyde: \nIt has been called an \"obstetric center\" for decades in the NRS and never got changed.  It was \nbefore birth centers were as prevalent as they are now.  It is a holdover and has just not been \nchanged.  There really is not a difference because we are talking about the same thing.  The \nproblem  is  when  you  call  it  an  obstetric  center,  I  think  people  are  confused  because \na freestanding birth center is called out in functional guidelines in other regulatory wording.  \nIt is not called an obstetric center in other states or in other regulatory wording. \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nI had the impression an obstetric center was mostly just for deliveries but that the birthing \ncenter did the prenatal care, did the birth and postpartum care, so it encompassed more care \nthan what an obstetric center would cover. \n \nApril Clyde: \nCorrect.  The birthing center does all of it.  It is care through what we call the \"birthing year.\"  \nFrom preconception until two months after delivery, we care for moms and babies.   \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nAgain, can you also explain how we came to a birthing center being 30 miles from a \nhospital? \n \nApril Clyde: \nI am not sure.  There is some research that supports being within 30 minutes, or 60 minutes, \nthat outcomes are better when there is that distance from the birth center specifically to a \ntertiary care hospital—a big hospital. \n \nTara Raines: \nResearch from late 2019 looked at distances for rural birthing people to hospitals.  They \nfound for low-intervention births where the birthing person knew in advance they would be \nfar away from a hospital, there was no benefit to being closer to the hospital.  The key to that \nwould be making sure people are prepared to be farther from a hospital.  I know that is part \nof this legislation, but it would be phenomenal if it were not, because birth centers are poised \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 31, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nto really support our rural communities and places where there are obstetric care deserts in \nNevada.  Having an anchor to a hospital could be limiting. \n \nApril Clyde: \nSpeaking to that, I have had a home-birth practice.  I have worked both in hospitals and out \nof the hospital, but I have many families who travel from hours away in Nevada to birth here \nbecause there is not a hospital where they live.   \n \nAssemblyman Hafen: \nMy question has to do with the current birthing center up north here.  It is not a freestanding \nbirthing center, which this bill is addressing, but I want to clarify on the record that there \nwould not be additional licensing requirements for that current birthing center. \n \nApril Clyde: \nAre you referring to the Melinda Hoskins Birth Center in Minden?  That is the only one I am \nfamiliar with. \n \nAssemblyman Hafen: \nIt is my understanding that there is a birthing center associated with Renown up here.  I am \nfrom down south, so I am not very familiar with it.  I want to be sure we are not putting \nadditional burdens onto the current birthing facilities. \n \nAssemblywoman Monroe-Moreno: \nThis legislation would only refer to freestanding birthing centers.  It would not have an \nimpact on those birthing centers associated with our hospitals or cause them to have to get \nany other licensure. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nWhen we talk about licensing questions and where people fall within licensure, we can only \nregulate what happens if the state has put onto the law books about licensure.  It was \ninteresting to hear the testimony that you are living between two different licensing types—\nan ambulatory surgical center or a nursing home but were neither one of those things. \n \nI guess this is more a comment than a question.  What we have experienced before is \nsomeone with less transparent intentions—and we have seen this happen in other types of \nlicensing groups, where people start practicing and because we do not have a clear law about \nwhat they can and cannot do, we cannot go in and regulate them.  We had this problem for \nyears  with  group  homes,  and  then  we  were  trying  to  define  group  homes.    Our  state \nombudsmen would go to inspect and say, \"You look like a group home\", and be told, \"No, \nI am not because here is what you say a group home is and I am not licensed as that.  Since I \nam not licensed, you cannot touch me.\"  So we were constantly chasing through the 2011 \nSession, the 2013 Session, and the 2017 Session, trying to get these people onto the map.  \nOne thing I have appreciated when it comes to saying \"here is a clear path for licensure\" is \nyou know everything that is happening in your community and everyone who is willing to \nhang out a shingle and be transparent is known, and we have a better idea of what is \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 31, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nhappening versus if we only have a space where people exist ambiguously, without state \noversight, they will exist there.  That is what I always appreciate when we talk about trends \nin a community.  If we think it is worthwhile and ought to be done safely, then we ought to \nhave a serious conversation about regulations and licensure and how we ensure it is done \nsafely. \n \nAssemblywoman Monroe-Moreno: \nI appreciate your saying that and I appreciate the staff at Serenity Birth Center.  They could \nhave started this business three years ago and just opened their doors because they were \nin-between.  But it is very important to them and other midwives I have been working with to \nmake sure our policies as a state—the statutes in our NRS—are clear and concise.  They will \ntake as long as necessary to be sure they are following those guidelines and making sure that \nwithin this legislation there is enforcement.  You will see that in sections 17, 18, 20, and \n25—to make sure they are adhering to what we will set forth in this policy as we move \nforward.  So thank you to them for following the guidelines they had in that in-between \nspace. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nI did my OB training as a second-year resident at Los Angeles County General Hospital.  As \na medical doctor, I spent two months delivering babies every third night—sometimes 50 \nbabies a night.  It was everything wrong that this bill tries to solve:  no prenatal care, it was \nan amazingly intense experience, and I was pregnant at the time.  When I chose to have my \nbabies, I had them at Saint Mary's Hospital in Reno where they have wonderful birthing \nrooms.  You can have someone with you, the baby never leaves the room, and it was a \nwonderful experience for me.  \n \nSomeone testified that, in order to partake in this, you already had to have prenatal care or \nyou could not go to one of these birthing centers.  Is that correct? \n \nTara Raines: \nNo, I would like to clarify.  I went to an OB in trying to decide whether to pursue a typical \nroute versus a birth center.  The birth centers provide OB care, and in many cases birth \ncenters provide fertility support and well-person care for folks who are trying to conceive. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nAre these birthing centers all for-profit birthing centers? \n \nTara Raines: \nNo, it is a mixture.  It depends on the model of the owners and operators. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nSo there are some nonprofits? \n \nTara Raines: \nAbsolutely. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 31, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nIf a person walks into a birthing center and is going to have a baby, are there any EMTALA \n[Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act] violations?  What rules do you have to \nfollow?  Can you turn someone away? \n \nApril Clyde: \nIt is not like a labor and delivery unit at a hospital where you can just show up.  You have to \nbe a healthy, low-risk woman.  Having no prenatal care risks you out for care in a birth \ncenter. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nWill you accept Medicaid payment, cash payments, and will you accept someone who has no \nmeans of payment? \n \nApril Clyde: \nYes, and it is far less expensive when you are comparing vaginal birth to vaginal birth—\napples to apples—to birth in a birthing center.  We do accept women with late care, for \ninstance, someone beginning prenatal care in their second trimester or even in their third \ntrimester; but you cannot, as you can in a hospital, just show up and have had no prenatal \ncare. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nHaving done OB in rural Nevada with no backup, I know birthing can be a wonderful \nexperience.  It was something that I felt, as a family practice doctor, to be a complete family \ndoctor, I needed to do OB, and we would select our low-risk patients.  At the same time, \nunfortunately, even with low-risk patients, there is statistically about 20 percent of the ones \nI just  looked  at  will  be  transferred  to  a  hospital—that  is  the  current  rate  I  am  seeing \nnationwide.  Twenty percent, even in the low-risk moms, will be transferred to a hospital \ncenter for some sort of assistance with delivery, some sort of medication, recovery.  How do \nyou deal with that?  How do you deal with the transfer?   Do you have to have agreements \nwith  local  hospitals  for  those  situations  we  know  will  happen,  even  in  the  best  of \ncircumstances?  How will you deal with those pregnancies? \n \nApril Clyde: \nI think the number is 12 percent; the 20 percent may be total transfers and we are talking \nfrom the beginning of prenatal care? \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nCorrect.  That is the figure:  20 percent total transfers. \n \nApril Clyde:  \nMost of those are happening through prenatal care.  Someone gets gestational diabetes, \nsomeone has high blood pressure, and then they are not a candidate.  We are the experts in \nnormal—which is the vast majority of pregnant people in the United States.  That is what we \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 31, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \nare the experts in.  Speaking for our practice, we have a collaborative agreement with the \nUNLV School of Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nSo, you have an agreement with another center.  Will there be a requirement that there is an \nagreement with other facilities for the known complications, or the \"safe handoff\"?  Living in \nthe world and having had it happen, it is important that you know when it does happen, you \nhave that \"warm\" handoff.  Do you have any kind of requirements for that? \n \nTara Raines: \nCurrently, there is no requirement for that in the legislation.  I believe that is to reduce \nbarriers.  What other states have found is that some of the hospitals have not been as excited \nas  we  are  to  see  birthing  centers  in  their  communities,  despite  the  positive  outcomes \nassociated.  Of course, AABC and all birth centers would be strongly encouraged to develop \nformal relationships with hospitals.  What April Clyde said is that the early risk out, so those \nfolks are encouraged to find other care long before delivery.  Building relationships with both \nemergency departments and local OBs has been incredibly helpful for birthing centers and \ntransfers.  The birthing center where I delivered had a relationship with a local hospital and \nI was encouraged to check that hospital out ahead of time, in the event that I had to transfer \nfor one reason or another. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nAgain, that is where I am going with that question.  It is that safe transfer.  One of the \narguments for this bill is the poor outcome, especially as you quoted, in certain groups of \nwomen.  If all these requirements are there, you are almost preselecting that these women \nwill not qualify for this birthing center.  I want to make sure this is really helping solve the \nproblem you are trying to solve. \n \nTara Raines: \nOne of the key pieces of the birthing center is the prenatal education—that nutrition support, \nthat mental health support.  We found that with those pieces in place, it reduces morbidity.  If \nI am a super low-income, very young birthing person and I am getting nutrition support and \nsupport around healthy choices, I may not develop gestational diabetes that would risk me \nout.  I may not develop some of these other morbidities that we would consider disqualifying \nfactors for birth center supports.  The idea is to take a preventive approach. \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nLiability.  What type of liability coverage is mandated for these services? \n \nApril Clyde: \nThe way the law is now, the providers that have to be there for every birth include a nurse \npractitioner, nurse-midwife, and a registered nurse at every birth.  The nurse practitioner and \nthe  practice  are  required  to  carry  $1  million/$3  million  policy.    This  is  the  same  as \nOB/GYNs. \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 31, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThat was my limit:  $1 million/$3 million to practice OB.  In these birthing centers, and I like \nthe concept, I like having someone there.  I did that; I stayed by their side; it was a wonderful \nexperience to deliver a baby, but having had the experience of home deliveries, emergency \ndeliveries,  roadside  deliveries,  in-my-house  deliveries,  it  can  be  exciting  but  it  can  be \nterrifying.  If you are outside the other requirements for an obstetrical center or a hospital, are \nyou going to be required to have resuscitative equipment there or emergency equipment for \npostpartum hemorrhage, those kinds of things?  Will you be able to use Pitocin?  Will you be \nable to use anything if it does not stop, other than massage of the uterus?  What will you be \nrequired to have in your facility?   \n \nApril Clyde: \nThe Commission for the Accreditation of Birth Centers—think The Joint Commission—\nrequires everything you just described.  We have to have a crash cart and resuscitative \nequipment for mom and baby.  We have an AED machine and all the anti-hemorrhagic \nmedication—that all has to be there.  \n \nAssemblywoman Titus: \nThank you for the bill and all the questions you allowed me. \n \nAssemblywoman Krasner: \nWill these birthing centers have the equivalent of a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for \nbabies born in fetal distress? \n \nApril Clyde: \nWe have the same ability as a level 3 NICU—a well nursery.  This is what most rural \nhospitals in Nevada have, as well as what some suburban hospitals in southern Nevada have.  \nWe can take care of well newborns.  We do have resuscitation equipment, but we do not see \npreterm babies.  You have to be at least 37 weeks to deliver at the birth center.  Everyone, the \nRNs, the nurse practitioners, are all neonatal resuscitation-trained.  We also have protocols \nwith the three fire departments that could be responding if there was a situation where a mom \nor baby needed to be transported to the hospital.  Next week we are running drills with them \nfor transport. \n \nAssemblywoman Krasner: \nI know there are different levels of hospitals in regard to the urgent care they can provide.  \nThis goes to section 12, subsection 2, reading that the freestanding birthing center must be \nlocated 30 minutes from a hospital that offers obstetrics and emergency services.  When \nI gave birth to my first son, I was super healthy.  It was a low-risk pregnancy and I was \noffered to give birth in a more rural hospital that did not have the highest level of services for \na child born in fetal distress and it was 15 minutes away from a hospital that did.  I opted to \ngo to the hospital with the experts.  Thank goodness because even though I was a low-risk \npregnancy, my son was born in fetal distress and would have died in the 15 miles from that \nhospital to the other one.  Who would have known?  I was low risk, and this really concerns \nme. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 31, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \nApril Clyde: \nThere has been a lot of research comparing what is called intermittent fetal monitoring. This \nis what is done at a birthing center and moms can be in any position.  They can be in the \nwater  and we  are  listening  and  there  is  a  national  protocol  for  this listening.   That  is \ncompared to what is done in the hospital which is continuous fetal monitoring.  You may be \nmore familiar with this.  There is a wire, there is a belt on mom connected to a wire in a \nmachine that is continuously monitoring the baby's heart rate.  There has not been found to \nbe a difference between mommy outcomes or baby outcomes with continuous monitoring \nand intermittent monitoring. \n \nThere will be babies who need to be resuscitated just as you are in labor room 1, and they are \nplanning for a normal vaginal delivery, there is distress, and mom gets moved either to the \noperating room or staff come in for resuscitation of baby.  These same protocols are planned \nfor and we have emergency services and personnel there to resuscitate a baby if necessary.  \nWe also are not waiting for emergencies to happen.  If babies are not tolerating labor well, if \nwe are hearing decelerations in the heart rate, we are going to the hospital and we have \noxygen and emergency equipment to be taking mom and/or baby to the hospital. \n \nAssemblywoman Peters: \nI want to commend you all on your presentation and the bill.  The amendment is fantastic and \nnovel.  Great job, wonderfully written and well thought out.  I also want to say that having \nhad three kids at home and doing all the research, where you choose to birth is really an \nintuitive choice.  And Assemblywoman Krasner, you used your intuition to decide where the \nbest place was for you to birth.  The idea of options is directed at exactly that.  We should \ntrust women and their bodies and their intuition and willingness to listen to themselves, take \nin information, understand what the risks are for them and their babies, and give them the \nopportunity to make those choices themselves.  This is about that right to be a parent.  I \ncommend the bill's sponsor and the folks who are advocating for this and the people who are \nstanding up these kinds of facilities.  You are enabling women and birthing people to do what \nis best for them and their families. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nThis is a good stopping point to go to callers for testimony in support, opposition, and \nneutral.  We will begin with testimony in support.  [There was none.]  Are there any callers \nin opposition? \n \nKatie Ryan, System Director, Nevada Government Relations, Dignity Health-St. Rose \nDominican: \nI am calling in opposition to A.B. 287, and I provided a letter on behalf of St. Rose and \nour chief  medical  officer,  Dr.  Rodney  Buzzas,  which  describes  our  issues  with the  bill \n[Exhibit J].  We want mothers to have their babies in a comfortable setting, but we also want \nto make sure that those settings are as safe as possible and close to a higher level of care if \nneeded. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 31, 2021 \nPage 27 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there any more callers in opposition?  [There were none.]  Do we have any callers in \nneutral  on  A.B.  287?    [There  were  none.]    With  that,  I  will  turn  this  back  over  to \nAssemblywoman Monroe-Moreno for any closing remarks. \n \nAssemblywoman Monroe-Moreno: \nThank you for giving us the opportunity to present this bill.  I see a birthing center as another \noption for moms.  We should trust women to know what they want to do with their bodies \nand where they want to give birth to their babies—if it is at home in the living room, in a \npool, in a hospital, or in a birthing center.  I urge your support. \n \n[Exhibit K and Exhibit L were submitted but not discussed and will become part of the \nrecord.] \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWith that, I will close the hearing on A.B. 287. \n \nWe will now open the hearing on Assembly Bill 426.  We have Buffy Okuma, Chief Deputy \nDistrict Attorney in the Washoe County District Attorney's Office, as well as Gabrielle Carr, \nJuvenile Master in the Sixth Judicial District Court, who will present the bill. \n \nAssembly  Bill  426:    Makes  various  changes  relating  to  the  protection  of  children. \n(BDR 38-516) \n \nGabrielle Carr, Juvenile and Family Court Master, Sixth Judicial District Court: \nI also serve as chair for the Subcommittee of the Community Improvement Program (CIP) \nwhich is part of the Nevada Supreme Court that was created to create this bill.  As the chair, \nI have been practicing family law and related cases including child dependency for about \n25 years, so I have covered this topic from all aspects of dealing with representing the \nparents, the kid, representing child welfare agencies, and now overseeing these cases.  Also \nwith me as a copresenter is Ms. Buffy Okuma, Chief Deputy District Attorney for Washoe \nCounty, and also with us to answer questions is Chief Deputy District Attorney Janne \nHanrahan from Clark County.  So you have Washoe, Clark, and the rurals represented by our \npresenters today. \n \nThe Community Improvement Program was created to allow all of the districts within the \nstate to come together and work together as a team, to improve outcomes for children in child \nwelfare cases.  This CIP team involves judges, masters, attorneys, social workers, guardians \nad litem, administrators, Nevada Supreme Court staff, and it is managed and controlled by \nretired Nevada Supreme Court Justice Nancy Saitta. \n \nEvery year we have a meeting we call our CIP summit and all the teams come to one place \nand talk about how to do things better.  In 2019 I suggested we create a committee of people \nto address all the issues we were having with Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 432B, \nand I wound up chairing that committee.  I reached out to all the stakeholders who attend \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 31, 2021 \nPage 28 \n \nthese meetings throughout the districts and created a team, and I shared it with your staff \n[Exhibit M].  This is a list of all the stakeholders who were contacted who joined this \nsubcommittee along with me.  Luckily, I had Ms. Buffy Okuma join me as cochair of this \ncommittee.    We  have  been  meeting  every  month,  and  sometimes  every  week,  for \napproximately a year, to see what we could do to address all the issues we were having under \nNRS Chapter 432B. \n \nI believe you all have a copy of this document, so I do not want to spend too much time on it, \nbut I just wanted you to see that we have representatives from the Nevada Supreme Court, \nthe State of Nevada, all jurisdictions except for the Tenth Judicial District, and including the \ndirector for the Court Appointed Special Advocates, or CASA Program in Nevada.  In \nmeeting every month, one of the things we agreed to do was, whatever changes we wanted to \nmove forward in this bill had to be unanimously agreed to by all committee members, and we \ndid.  Our goal was twofold:  One, clean up anything that needs to be updated and modified to \nfit the practical application in the community as we deal with these cases on a day-to-day \nbasis.  And, two, address the fact that in 2011 there was a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \nopinion that said, before a child welfare agency can remove a child, you have to have a \nwarrant from the court.  That warrant process is different for every jurisdiction, so part of our \ngoal was to codify the need for a warrant and make it more uniform so the districts could \nhave a greater, more uniform application.  \n \nBuffy  Okuma,  Chief  Deputy  District  Attorney,  Washoe  County  District  Attorney's \nOffice: \nI am the Chief Deputy District Attorney for our child protection services unit.  We have a \ntotal of eight attorneys who represent the Human Services Agency of Washoe County solely \ndoing matters with regard to NRS Chapter 432B all the way through termination of parental \nrights.  I will do a brief overview.  Within our committee, we identified the number of areas \nwe wanted to address.  Pursuant to our agreement for everybody to have consensus on what \nwe were going to work on in a pretty short time frame, we decided on several topics and \nended up narrowing those down.  There were a few heavy-lift topics we were not able to get \nconsensus on to move forward, but the benefit of that is that we now have a platform for how \nour committee can come together to propose legislation and legislative changes to various \nchapters we deal with every day. \n \nWe ended up with two main topics that we would move forward on.  One topic was the \nwarrant process,  and the other topic was cleanup of all those things we have all been \noverlooking and fudging around in order to get our cases going.   \n \nMaster  Carr  mentioned  the  Court of  Appeals opinion.   The  first  Ninth  Circuit  opinion \nactually came out in 1999 and another one came out in early 2000, so it was on the radar in \nNevada for quite a while.  It ultimately resulted in the Washoe County Human Services \nAgency being sued, thus the opinion Master Carr referenced.  During that time period \nbetween the early 2000s and when that lawsuit occurred, there were conversations all the \ntime about the need for a warrant, and the response was always that we did not have any \nprocess.  There were all kinds of processes in place for criminal cases, but it had not been \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 31, 2021 \nPage 29 \n \napplied in the child welfare world until the early 2000s.  It was a struggle to get the process \nin  place,  and  the  implementation  across  the  state  of  Nevada  was  extremely  slow  and \ndisjointed.  We talked for years about trying to get the warrant process codified in NRS \nChapter 432B so that we would not have to patch together a bunch of case law to figure out \nwhat is required; but also, try to be more consistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, at the \nsame time recognizing the differences.  I think we accomplished that with section 1 of the \nbill. \n \nSection 2 of the bill was a conforming change.  With regard to section 3 of the bill, there is \nnothing significant in that it provided some clarification.  Section 4 of the bill is also a \nconforming change to recognize the warrant process.  When we get to section 5, we added \none word, but it is a really powerful word.   We added the word that we would have \njurisdiction in any county where a child is \"domiciled.\"   In Nevada, we have three separate \nchild welfare agencies under three separate jurisdictional overlays.  In Washoe County, it is \nhandled by the Washoe County Human Services Agency with the District Attorney's Office \nrepresenting them.  In Clark County, the cases are handled by the Clark County Child \nProtective Services Division with the Clark County District Attorney's Office representing \nthem.  In all the rurals, the cases are handled by the Division of Child and Family Services \n(DCFS)  within  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  with  the  Office  of  the \nAttorney General as their legal counsel, though they do not participate in the actual hearings \nuntil it gets to a termination phase—so it is a little disjointed, but far better than it was in the \n1990s.   \n \nWhen we have jurisdictional issues—and in the north they are often between Carson City and \nWashoe County—and there are some similar situations in the south.  Often, we will have a \nfamily that lives in Carson City, but the child is born in Washoe County—generally at \nRenown because of the specialized services Renown offers.  We have this situation multiple \ntimes a year where the child is born in Washoe County, but the parents reside in Carson City.  \nOur statute as it currently stands is pretty narrow.  It says that a court has jurisdiction where a \nchild resides or where a child is found, so when you have a newborn baby, they do not really \nreside in the hospital, but they are certainly found there.  They have never resided anywhere \nelse.  So we have situations where Washoe County has had to take action on that case and go \nto court in Washoe County, and then there is a big long process to transfer the case to Carson \nCity and then to DCFS, all the while it is taking up time when the parents could be getting \nservices.  By adding the word \"domicile,\" we have a lot of case law that says that a newborn \nchild is domiciled where their parents reside, which takes care of that problem.   \n \nSection 6 clarifies and expands a provision about persons with a \"special interest.\"  In child \nwelfare cases there are a lot of parties—more parties than in typical family law cases.  In \nfamily law cases you often have mom and dad, maybe grandparents and mom.  In child \nwelfare cases, we often have a mom and mom's attorney; dad and dad's attorney; the children \nand their attorney; the CASA, the social worker and their attorney; and then we have a \nhandful of other people who are involved, like the foster parents.  The federal government \nand our state adopted this provision with regard to persons with a special interest, indicating \nthat the court really needs to hear from some people because they have knowledge about the \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 31, 2021 \nPage 30 \n \nchild and about the child's needs and the child's need for permanency.  This provision in the \nstatute indicates that if a person is designated as a person with a special interest, they are not \na party to the case but they are entitled to have notice of any hearings, notice of what the \npermanency plan is for the child, an opportunity to provide input about that permanency plan, \nand an opportunity to provide input to the court in court proceedings.  It does trigger some \nadditional protections.   \n \nWe  have  struggled  since  the  beginning  putting  that in  because  how  does  a  person  get \ndesignated?    The  statute  never  said,  and  so  we  would  constantly  have  various  family \nmembers, former foster parents, all kinds of people filing motions in our cases.  However, \nthey were not a \"party.\"  We cannot open the floodgates to have even more parties in all our \ncases, so we amended that to identify that a court can designate someone.  The foster parent \nis in court, they are always notified, and someone can tell a judge they think the foster parent \nshould be designated so they get all these extra protections, or a relative comes to the court \nproceeding and says, \"Hey, I would like that designation so I can get these extra protections.\"  \nImportantly, it also provides for the court to be able to review or modify that designation.  \nWe have had situations where a former foster parent is designated as a person with a special \ninterest and a year has gone by and that person is not involved in the case anymore, but we \nhave  to  continue  to  notice  them  because  there  was  never  a  provision  for  them  to  be \nundesignated. \n \nSection 7 updates and clarifies what is in existing law.  Right now, when we have what we \ncall either a protective custody hearing or 72-hour hearing, if a child is placed into protective \ncustody, the agency has to provide notice to the parents.  It was an open question as to what \nefforts they had to make when they cannot find the parent.  That is one of the things that \ntakes up a lot of time in our proceedings when we are all arguing over what happens if the \nparent cannot be found.  It also updates the provision.  Existing law says that if we are not \nable to find the parent and either personally serve them or serve them over the phone or \norally, that the social worker had to post notice on their door.  We are really concerned about \nthat.  I got sued four times because the notice blew off the person's door so that person said \nthey did not get proper notice.  A whole host of us were caught up in that. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nMs. Okuma, I am sorry to interrupt you.  I see that you are going through the bill section by \nsection.  I trust that all our Committee members have read the bill to prepare for today's \nhearing and I know they have some questions.  Do you want to open up for questions? \n \nBuffy Okuma: \nAbsolutely.   \n \nChair Nguyen: \nSome Committee members have another committee meeting at 4 p.m. and I want to make \nsure they are able to ask questions.   Thank you for that presentation.  Looking at the \n45 people on your list and the idea that you have consensus from that many lawyers is a feat \nin and of itself.  We will now go to questions. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 31, 2021 \nPage 31 \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nI had a question about section 1, subsection 1.  It reads that the \"designee may request that \nthe court issue a warrant to place a child in protective custody,\" and then it says, if not \nneeded \"in the time it would take to obtain a warrant.\"  Is this an emergency warrant so it \nworks faster than going through a court warrant? \n \nBuffy Okuma: \nThe way federal law and case law have come out is that you have to have a warrant, unless, \nin the time it takes to get a warrant, the child would suffer or potentially would suffer harm.  \nThis  provision  allows  us  to  get  a  warrant  when  we  are  able  to  but  leaves  open  the \npossibility if we are not able to get a warrant in that time frame.  The example I often give is \nthe three-year-old who is found outside alone.  You cannot leave that child to go get a \nwarrant, and so that would be an exigent circumstance.  Otherwise, we would need to get a \nwarrant. \n \nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \nAgain, in section 1, subsection 4, paragraph (b), it says it is valid for ten days.  Is that \ncalendar or business days? \n \nBuffy Okuma:  \nUnder the new rules of civil procedure, it clarifies in counting days, that if it does not specify \notherwise, it would be calendar days, so this would be calendar days.   The reason for that is \nbecause  sometimes  we  know  where  the  family  is,  but  after  we  get  the  warrant,  they \ndisappear.  So sometimes the agency needs some time to try to find them.  However, the \ncourt can make that a shorter window if it chooses. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nRight now, we are building the legislative record that will be reflected upon for this law and \nthere was so much thought that went into it.  I thought it might be helpful to upload the \nminutes from the meeting to our Exhibits, knowing we might not be able to do a deep \nwalkthrough  on  the  bill.    The  minutes  might  help  justify  the  bill  or  help  flesh  out \nunderstanding about what the thinking was. \n \nFor the legislative record, what would be a clear example of \"reasonable cause\" and the time \nframe you would be looking to define in statute versus an unreasonable example?  For \ninstance, the child on the Pyramid Highway who needs to be scooped up quickly was a great \nexample.  Could you give an example of one, such as workers out in the field, that would not \nmeet the standard for the warrant? \n \nBuffy Okuma: \nThe most common case we see is one where parents are found to be under the influence of \nsubstances and a child is present, but the child is not at immediate risk at that moment.  The \nworker is able to step out because most of our warrants can be obtained by phone, so for the \nworker is able to step out of the immediate scene and apply for the warrant over the phone \nand get it.  That is probably the most common situation we see. \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 31, 2021 \nPage 32 \n \n \nChair Nguyen: \nI am not sure if the Community Improvement Program Committee maintains minutes, but if \nyou do, I would ask you to provide them to Committee staff so we can make them a part of \nthis legislative record.  I know you had several meetings with your subcommittee members \nand other participants in developing the recommendations in this proposed legislation. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nI see with the warrant there is a ten-day process and when you get the actual protective order, \nthat is a 72-hour process.  It sounds as though this has evolved through case law or through \npractice.  Can you tell us more?  It seems that ten days seems generous.  It seems long, but is \nthat true?  Why does ten days make more sense versus nine days or eleven days? \n \nBuffy Okuma: \nWe had a lot of discussions about how long a warrant could be valid.  Ten days is how long \nwe can have to execute the warrant and not how long we have after you have placed the \nchildren into protective custody.  It also is expected that that is the outside limit.  That is why \nthat provision is in there—so there is a time when we know this warrant is no longer valid.  It \nis our expectation, and I do know that in the Second Judicial District Court, it is anticipated \nthat the court will, in granting the warrant, have a shorter time period.  Right now, more often \nthan not, our court is limiting the validity of that warrant to 72 hours.  If we have a good \nreason, we can get an extension up to ten days, based on that example I mentioned of the \nfamily that flees and we are trying to find them.  It gives you some time to do that. \n \nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \nSo we should mean this to be up to ten days and not a static ten days. \n \nBuffy Okuma: \nRight. \n \nJanne Hanrahan, Chief Deputy District Attorney, Clark County District Attorney's \nOffice: \nI am with the Juvenile Division doing child welfare cases.  I lead the committee that put \ntogether the warrant statute and wanted to add that the ten days also takes into account what \nwe have down here a lot, as I am sure Washoe County does as well.  We have the kind of \nsituation that led to the case that requires us to get warrants, which is a baby born in a \nhospital,  drug-exposed  or  to  a  mom  who  is  not  appropriate  to  take  that  child  home.  \nSometimes those babies are in the hospital for a period of time.  They are in the hospital \nbeing taken care of, someone is supervising mom being in there.  It contemplates that period \nof time that the baby is in the hospital too and may not be officially removed right away.  So \nthe ten days was a compromise.  It is true down here as well where we have a lot more \nvolume.  The vast majority of warrants are served within 24 to 48 hours of being issued.  I do \nnot think this is a situation that will be taken advantage of. \n \n   \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 31, 2021 \nPage 33 \n \nChair Nguyen: \nDo you have any follow-up?  Does anyone have further questions?  [There were none.]  I will \ngo to the phone lines and begin testimony in support, opposition, and neutral to this bill, \nbeginning with testimony in support of A.B. 426. \n \nDaShun  Jackson,  Director  of  Children's  Safety  and  Welfare  Policy,  Children's \nAdvocacy Alliance: \nWe stand in support of A.B. 426.  We believe this bill is crucial to the safety and welfare of \nchildren.  We also believe this bill would save lives and would also help with many of the \nissues that these youth face. \n \nKendra  G.  Bertschy,  Deputy  Public  Defender,  Washoe  County  Public  Defender's \nOffice: \nI want to thank the Committee for hearing this bill.  As you heard, our state is in great need \nfor reforming our dependency statutes.  We appreciate the time everyone put together with \nthis committee.  We were involved in the process of negotiating, and the bill you see before \nyou is the product of carefully negotiated and crafted legislation that took a significant \namount of time.  Although it is not perfect and we have not completely reformed the entire \nNRS Chapter 432B statutes, we believe this is a very good start and would appreciate your \nsupport for this bill. \n \nJohn McCormick, Assistant Court Administrator, Nevada Supreme Court: \nWhile our Court Improvement Program has been mentioned several times, I wanted to call \nand register our support for the bill and appreciation for all the work done by the committee \nmembers and particularly by our cochair. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nAre there more callers in support?  [There were none.]  Do we have any callers in opposition \nto A.B. 426?  [There were none.]  Do we have any callers in neutral on the bill? \n \nAlexis  Tucey,  Deputy  Administrator,  Division  of  Child  and  Family  Services, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services: \nI would like to testify in neutral support for A.B. 426.  I would like to extend gratitude to the \ncourt improvement project for not only working on this bill as well as their continued efforts \nat improving the system as a whole for our youth and children in Nevada. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nWith that, do the presenters have any closing statements or remarks? \n \nGabrielle Carr: \nThank you for your time.  Because of the extensive nature of these committee meetings—and \nthere were three subcommittees within it—we do not have minutes from the meetings we \nheld.  However, I would be happy to provide a summary of what the \"meat\" of it was and \nwhy we did what we did, that might give you additional insight and clarity for each of the \nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 31, 2021 \nPage 34 \n \nsections.    It  might  be  easier  and faster  to  read  than  minutes  would  have  been  for  the \napproximately 20-plus committee meetings. \n \nChair Nguyen: \nIf we can get that information, it will supplement the record regarding changes in the sections \nyou are proposing.  Again, the kind of work you put into this to gather the consensus you \nhave  among  public  defenders,  district  attorneys,  and  courts  and  court  administrators  is \ncommendable.  With that, I will close the hearing on A.B. 426.  At this time, I will open \npublic comment.  [There was none.]  Are there any comments from Committee members?  \n[There were none.]  We are adjourned [at 4:05 p.m.].   \n \n           \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nTerry Horgan \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nAssemblywoman Rochelle T.

I will share a video about responses to a mental health crisis. \n \nI am excited to bring forward a group of bills that will help the State of Nevada \ntake steps to rebuild our crisis response system and address the needs of a \nperson in a behavioral health crisis. As the video alluded, a person will call \n911 and the operator will dispatch police, fire or medical personnel. For many \nfamilies  or  an  individual  experiencing  a  behavioral  health  crisis,  the  person \ncalling does not fit into one of these categories. Starting with work done in \nMaricopa County in Arizona and in other states across the Nation such Colorado \nand Oregon, we have begun to adopt and build a specific system designed to \naddress behavioral health.  \n \nThis has significant overlap between the criminal and social justice reform work \nwe have been tackling as a State, as well as the appropriate behavioral health \nresponse. When we roll law enforcement to every, or many behavioral health \ncrises, the person may need a behavioral health professional or peer specifically \ntrained to help. We are asking police to do what they were never designed to \ndo. Rather than continuing down this path, we seek to partner with and train \nlaw  enforcement,  building  an  appropriate  behavioral  health  response  that \npartners  with  law  enforcement  but  whenever  possible  does  not  include  law \nenforcement. \n \nFor many people experiencing a behavioral health crisis, interaction with law \nenforcement can often be retraumatizing. It is a significant shift in how we think \nabout responding to a behavioral health crisis with four critical elements I will \nreview on the following presentation (Exhibit F). \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 2, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nThe model built in Phoenix, Arizona, was picked up by Substance Abuse and \nMental Health Services Administration at the national level and is now being \ndistributed as a national best practice. That model has four critical components, \nthe first being a High Tech Crisis Call Center. I will bring forward another bill \nsponsored by the Health and Human Services Committee that will specifically \ntalk about the work happening around  988, the  National Suicide Prevention \nHotline, and centralizing behavioral health crises into a separate system with \nthis  High  Tech  Crisis  Call  Center.  Ninety  percent  of  those  experiencing  a \nbehavioral health crisis in the best practice models are able to be stabilized over \nthe phone through these call centers. The centers have specialists who do air \ntraffic control and are critically important as they know where there may be a \nmobile crisis team and where a bed may be available in an outpatient treatment \nprogram. We immediately lean into the case management necessary to support \nthat person in the immediate crisis and with any follow-up care. \n \nNext is the 24/7 Mobile Crisis unit for the 10 percent of callers who cannot be \nstabilized over the phone. These teams typically are comprised of a behavioral \nhealth specialist and a  peer.  This is why, to the prior  bill S.B. 69, we are \nspending the time and attention necessary to ensure we are developing our peer \nworkforce since this model is highly dependent on having those peers as part of \nthe response. Someone with lived experience along with a behavioral health \nprofessional can be dispatched by the air traffic control system to meet people \nin the hospital emergency room, on a street corner or in the family’s home or \nwherever necessary to help stabilize that crisis.  \n \nSenate  Bill  156  specifically  addresses  the  crisis  stabilization  center.  Last \nSession, the Washoe County Behavioral Health Policy Board brought forward a \nbill to do licensing for crisis stabilization centers in an effort to help build this \nmodel. We learned the language we put together was too narrow by limiting \ncrisis  stabilization  centers  to  psychiatric  hospitals  only,  which  was  not  an \nappropriate approach. This bill seeks to expand the number of agencies that can \nbe considered and pursue endorsements to become crisis stabilization centers. \nAlong with that would be a model to bill Medicaid for those services so we can \nbuild the financial model allowing these crisis stabilization programs to become \na reality. \n \nThat is the meat of this particular bill. It is important the crisis stabilization and \nall of the components of the crisis stabilization program have these essential \nprinciples and practices. These principles include an orientation to recovery, skill \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 2, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nand training in trauma informed care, significant use of peer staff, commitment \nto zero suicide and suicide safer care principles, safety to consumer and staff, \nand  collaboration  with  law  enforcement  so  these  components  get  woven \nthrough the entire system of care. \n \nIn Phoenix, it took 13 years to build this system. We hope to accelerate that; \nhowever, there has been a solid two years of ground work laid by Leadership \nand the Department of Health and Human Services working with the regional \nbehavioral health policy boards. I was invited to Phoenix to see their program in \npractice which sold me on the fact this is the direction we need to move as a \nState. The best outcomes will be for patients getting better immediate care and \nmore positive behavioral health crisis response.  \n \nLong-term  savings  could  potentially  benefit  both  local  governments  and  the \nState. This would give the ability to redirect the significant amount of resources \nlaw enforcement agencies are spending now toward behavioral health crises \nback toward public safety and keeping people out of local hospital rooms, which \nis not good for the patient or our budget. \n \nDUANE  YOUNG  (Deputy  Administrator,  Division  of  Health  Care  Financing  and \nPolicy, Department of Health and Human Services): \nThe goal of S.B. 156 is to modify the positions of Assembly Bill No. 66 of the \n80th Session. The removal of the 16-bed requirement would assist in allowing \ncurrent psychiatric facilities to overcome the burden of creating a hospital within \na hospital. Expanding this to acute hospitals will allow them to be endorsed and \nreimbursed, providing a higher standard of care to individuals already presenting \nin  an  emergency  room,  and  these  cases  would  be  triaged  to  the  most \nappropriate level of care. \n \nThe Division of Health Care Financing and Policy (DHCFP) met with multiple \nfacilities and hospitals willing to participate in models such as Crisis Now and \nEmPath if these restrictions are removed, allowing for greater flexibility and a \nreimbursement mechanism for Medicaid higher than the observation codes. This \nwould allow facilities to provide higher standards of care and recruit and retain \nmore professionals in behavioral health.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 2, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nSTEPHANIE WOODARD, PSY.D. (Senior Advisor, Division of Public and Behavioral \nHealth, Department of Health and Human Services): \nSeveral years ago, the National Association of State Mental Health Program \nDirectors issued a number of policy briefs looking at the need to move beyond \nbeds. The majority of individuals in a behavioral health crisis will, more often \nthan not, end up in an emergency room where they may or may not end up with \nspecialty  psychiatric  care.  Oftentimes,  they  wait  hours,  if  not  days,  for  an \nappropriate placement and may not receive a comprehensive evaluation to help \ndetermine what level of care they need and match them with the appropriate \nservices.  \n \nThe living room model is a completely different paradigm. We are talking about \na large room enabling people to be actively engaged and one of the reasons the \ninfusion of peers is vitally important. We work with individuals where they are in \nrelation  to  their  crisis,  actively  engaging  them  in  problem  solving  and \nde-escalation. We recognize the need for safety if an individual needs additional \nsupport or access to a bed and see this as one of the reasons hospitals need to \nbe able to do this. \n \nLiving room models are considered warm and welcoming. There are no staff \nbehind plexiglass windows. The models are designed to invite individuals to \nengage with treatment providers and peers in meaningful interactions.  \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nAn important concept of this is a subacute model and is traditionally meant to \nlast 24 hours or less. If people cannot be stabilized in that period of time, the \nnext step would be to put them in an appropriate level of care in an inpatient \nfacility. If they can be stabilized, it ensures they are discharged with a good \ncase management plan, with outpatient care and appropriate medications. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nDo you anticipate some of these programs would be built within our existing \nacute care facilities? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nWith  the  16-bed  requirement,  it  was  not  advantageous  for  hospitals  and \npsychiatric facilities because it is expensive to run a separate 16-bed facility. \nStriking the language as it is in the bill and allowing acute hospitals would \nprovide  a  separate  area  within  the  hospital  without  restraints  from  the  bed \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 2, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \ncount, which would be more flexible for staffing. It would be an area within the \nhospital. Both the EmPath model and Crisis Now look at separate areas that are \nmore  comfortable  and  conducive  to  an  environment  of  recovery  within  the \nfacility.  Someone  would  be  moved  out  the  emergency  room  into  this  area, \ntriaged appropriately within the first 24 hours, and given an appropriate level of \ncare or plan of safe discharge to return home. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIf someone is on a Legal 2000 hold, is that person eligible for placement in a \ncrisis stabilization center? \n \nMS. WOODARD: \nIt is possible. We would expect that a number of individuals presenting for care \nin a crisis stabilization unit or center would already be initiated on a Legal 2000 \nhold. We have found the vast majority of individuals coming in on legal holds do \nnot meet criteria where this is in place. A thorough evaluation can determine if \nan individual does meet criteria for a legal hold, and the center staff can do the \ntransfer  of  care  whether  in  their  hospital  or  a  hospital  within  their  region, \nensuring the individual is placed most appropriately depending upon the need. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nAre  there  security  requirements  around  withholding  someone  under  legal \ncustody? \n \nMS. WOODARD: \nThis is one of the reasons we want our crisis stabilization units or centers to be \nin  existing  hospitals.  They  must  meet  a  number  of  safety  and  security \nmeasures, including antiligature for the ability to do seclusion and restraint if \nnecessary. In hospitals or crisis stabilization centers that have used this model, \nthe need for seclusion and restraint is very little. Much of this has to do with \nnot only the philosophy behind the care provided, but the way the staff are \ntrained to engage with individuals in crisis. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThe  important  piece  to  making  this  successful  is  the  ability  to  say  yes  to \neveryone. Whether it is a Legal 2000 hold, a substance use withdrawal issue or \nany other type of mental health issue, if law enforcement or a mobile crisis team \nhas brought these individuals to the door, the idea is that it is a very quick \nturnaround.  This  lets  law  enforcement  get  back  to  their  job,  and  the  crisis \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 2, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nstabilization center is set up to address any concern. Over time, you can train \nlaw enforcement to say yes. Other communities have learned you cannot say \nyes to everyone so individuals are not taken to these crisis stabilization centers. \nWhen we start making that decision, we lose the efficacy of the program. They \nhave  the  capabilities  built  in  and  therefore  a  higher  reimbursement  rate. \nCommunities have also found they are spending less money on individuals than \nthose sitting in an emergency room. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWe are talking about allowing places such as the Mallory Behavioral Health \nCrisis Center in Carson City to be built within the walls of a larger hospital, is \nthat correct? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nIt could be built within in the walls of a larger hospital but would not have to be, \nas long as a center can meet the licensing criteria. \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nThe Mallory Behavioral Health Crisis Center is one of the reasons we asked to \nbring forth this type of legislation because it did not fit in the existing language. \nThis would allow a center to receive the Medicaid reimbursement. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIs the Mallory Behavioral Health Crisis Center too large, with too many beds? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nNo, as it is considered licensed as an acute care hospital, not a free standing \npsychiatric hospital, it did not qualify. The removal of that language will allow a \ncenter to qualify to perform these services even though the staff are performing \nthem without a proper reimbursement. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThe first version of this bill limited it to psychiatric hospitals. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nHow does this affect, for instance, WestCare. Is that model still allowed under \nthis bill, or does it need to be a hospital, separate and distinct? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 2, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nAs for WestCare, or what is created in the Nevada Revised Statutes as a crisis \ntriage  center,  it  is  not  eliminated.  The  crisis  triage  centers  have  evolved \ndifferently than anyone had anticipated and have perhaps evolved differently in \nClark County than they have in Washoe County. They do not meet the full need \nof a robust behavioral health crisis stabilization, so we believe this bill is needed \nin addition to what is happening in care, treatment and services standards. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nHomelessness often co-occurs with a mental disorder. Do these stabilization \ncenters need to offer services for those who are homeless and experiencing \nmental health crises? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThe  experience  of  other  communities  has  been  that  individuals  experiencing \nhomelessness  also  experience  behavioral  health  crises.  If  you  have  a  more \nappropriate behavioral health response, you have a higher likelihood of helping \nthat individual move away from homelessness and into a more stable situation. \nHowever,  not  every  individual  experiencing  homelessness  coming  through  a \ncrisis  stabilization  will  get  housed.  Their  behavioral  health  crises  will  be \nstabilized. Due to the high tech, high touch air traffic control system and ability \nto connect them back to their case managers and case management programs \nembedded into the system, there will be a significant effort to attempt to get \nthem housed. We cannot guarantee everyone getting a crisis stabilized will be \nready and willing to go into housing. It does dramatically increase the odds this \nmay happen. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nIf officers respond, is there any way to be sure they will take individuals to a \ncrisis  stabilization  center  versus  jail?  Someone  may  be  combative  and  has \nassaulted an officer and is taken to jail. Is there some way to ensure when being \npicked up by an officer the person will end up at one of these centers? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nAnother  bill  is  coming  forward  where  we  can  dig  a  little  deeper  into  your \nquestion,  which  is  the  988  National  Suicide  Prevention  Hotline.  What  is \nimportant for the crisis stabilization system is there is a strong partnership with \nlaw enforcement. A big part of that is working with dispatch and ensuring the \nappropriate dispatch is happening for every situation. There will be times when \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 2, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nsomeone experiencing a behavioral health crisis is putting self or others in such \na level of danger a public safety response is appropriate. There will be other \nsituations where law enforcement will never be dispatched because there is not \na public safety issue. I cannot say there is a once-size-fits-all or guarantee. \nWhere the model works is when you dispatch the right response for what is \nhappening. This is where the learning we need to do with law enforcement, \ndispatch  and  behavioral  health  professionals  ensures  we  are  getting  the \nappropriate care to the individual. \n \nROBIN REEDY (National Alliance on Mental Illness Nevada): \nThe National Alliance on Mental Illness supports S.B. 156 and the idea of Crisis \nNow throughout our Nation and in Nevada.  \n \nCHRISTOPHER ROSE (Valley Health System Acute Care Hospitals Nevada): \nWhile we appreciate the work done on A.B. No. 66 of the 80th Session, it did \nlimit  the  kind  of  hospitals  that  could  provide  crisis  stabilization  services. \nSenate Bill 156 rectifies that unintended consequence. Valley Health Systems \nsupports S.B. 156. \n \nTARYN HIATT (American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, Nevada Chapter): \nTo see crisis services be improved and implement access to care, specifically \nsuicide safe care, we know this bill will save lives. The Nevada Chapter of the \nAmerican Foundation for Suicide Prevention supports S.B. 156. \n \nMARY WALKER (Carson Tahoe Health): \nCarson Tahoe Health supports S.B. 156. This bill will incentivize local hospitals \nto provide crisis stabilization services and is a great way for the State to partner \nwith hospitals to provide these services. It potentially expands access to these \ncritical services throughout Nevada. \n \nJOAN HALL (Nevada Rural Hospital Partners): \nNevada Rural Hospital Partners supports S.B. 156 and licensed hospitals being \nallowed an endorsement as a crisis stabilization center. We have seen other \nstates successfully use this type of service to increase access to the most \nbeneficial behavioral health care in an appropriate setting. There are several rural \nand frontier critical access hospitals in Nevada that are interested in providing \nthis type of service.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 2, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nSection 1, subsection 5, paragraph (b) of the bill requires proof the hospital is \naccredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities or the \nJoint Commission. The majority of critical access hospitals in Nevada are not \naccredited but rather licensed and certified by the Bureau of Healthcare Quality \nand Compliance of the Division of Public and Behavioral Health. We hope there \nis an opportunity to allow these hospitals to receive this endorsement if they \nmeet the requirements in this bill.  \n \nKIMBERLY BUCHHOLZ: \nI lost a brother to suicide and would appreciate having had more resources for \nhim to able to reach out. If this had been available, he might be alive today. \nBefore the crisis that took his life, he had an interaction with law enforcement, \nwas not sure how to handle the situation and passed from suicide a month \nlater.  This  is  someone  who  had  never  had  previous  interaction  with  law \nenforcement.  This  could  be  beneficial  to  our  community,  and  I  support \nS.B. 156. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThe comments made by Joan Hall regarding the accreditation at the Rural and \nFrontier hospitals is something we will look into because we want to ensure this \nmodel is available in as many Nevada communities as possible.  \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 156.  \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nI will open the hearing on S.B. 154. \n \nSENATE  BILL  154:  Makes  changed  related  to  Medicaid  coverage  of  certain \ntreatments administered at institutions for mental diseases. (BDR 38.451) \n \nSENATOR JULIA RATTI (Senatorial District No. 13): \nThis is a bill that came out of the Interim Committee on Healthcare focused on \nbehavioral health challenges. Building off the last bill we heard, S.B. 156, it will \nbe wonderful to get to a place where 90 percent of people experiencing a crisis \ncan be stabilized over the phone; another 8 percent or 9 percent stabilized by a \nmobile  crisis  team;  and  another  percentage  being  stabilized  in  a  crisis \nstabilization center. The truth of the matter is there will still be people in our \ncommunity, once stabilized, needing beds. They will need beds to pursue their \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 2, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nsubstance use or mental illness recovery, or it could be a child with a serious \nemotional disturbance.  \n \nOne of the barriers that exist in our community could be addressed if we were \nto  apply  to  Medicaid  for  a  waiver.  The  1915(i)  waiver  we  applied  for  last \nSession gave us the ability to work with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \nServices  (CMS)  to  do  some  things  around  tenancy  support  and  supportive \nhousing. This is the first step in a process allowing us to work with our federal \npartners  build  a  better  model  and  ensure  we  have  the  behavioral  health \nresources we need. \n \nI  will  review  the  Institution  for  Mental  Disease  (IMD)  Exclusion  Waiver \npresentation (Exhibit G), which explains what an IMD waiver is. This is defined \nas a facility that has 16 or more psychiatric beds, or 50 percent or more of their \nadmissions are for a behavioral health disorder. If you are an IMD, you are \nexcluded from being eligible for Medicaid reimbursement. This means if we want \nto invest in more beds in these settings, it would be a 100 percent General Fund \ncontribution. We would have to do this all with State dollars. In reality this does \nnot happen, and there is not a business model that works in our community \nallowing us to get to the number of beds required. \n \nThis exclusion from Medicaid reimbursement creates a roadblock for patients \nexperiencing these challenges. The first step to getting rid of this roadblock is \nS.B. 154. We get caught in a vicious cycle where if the Legislature has not \ndirected Medicaid to apply for a waiver, they do not have the budget authority \nneeded to move forward with that waiver. They cannot figure out how much \nprograms are going to cost without going through an extensive process with the \nCMS. The budget bill which directs them to apply for the waiver will allow for \nsome analysis to figure out if it makes sense to move forward. \n \nIn this case, this is a Medicaid waiver that does allow for Medicaid match to be \nused in these facilities. It is required to be budget neutral over the course of \nfive years.  There  are  usually  some  start-up  costs  and  upfront  investment \nrequired to get these services underway, which is a challenge. Once they are \nunderway,  we  save  money  on  the  backend  by  diverting  people  out  of \nemergency rooms and higher-expense services and facilities. \n \nThat is the nature of Medicaid waivers and generally how they work. Step one \nwould be to pass S.B. 154. Step two would be the waiver application put \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 2, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \ntogether by the DHCFP, our State Medicaid would go through the extensive \nprocess. Over 30 states have done this for substance use disorder treatment, \nand  we  are  closing  in  on  10  states that  have  pending  approval  for  serious \nmental illness and the emotionally disturbed. After we get the approval, we can \nstart implementing some of this treatment.  \n \nThe problem is there is not enough access to care for behavioral health, partially \ndue to an improper business model. The waiver to Medicaid would allow us to \napply for the IMD waiver and do it differently, proving we can make it budget \nneutral and be able to seek reimbursement for these facilities known as IMDs.  \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nIn Nevada, only two facilities in the north and one in the south qualify as not \nmeeting the IMD rule. These are all acute hospitals with inpatient psychiatric \nunits.  Fee-for-Service  Medicaid,  which  includes  seriously  and  persistently \nmentally ill individuals within the medically aged, blind and disabled populations, \nare dependent on these facilities and the two state hospitals.  \n \nOver the years, this has created a consistent bottleneck with people waiting for \ntreatment in emergency rooms and facilities. Managed care organizations have \nup to 15 days per month for crisis care for an individual in an inpatient setting in \nlieu of more expensive care. This does not account for individuals needing more \nintensive or longer-term care.  \n \nDue to the inability for Nevada to pay, we are without any clinically managed \ndetoxification programs that could treat individuals with any source of Medicaid. \nThe Substance Use Disorder Initiative seeks to supplement current Medicaid and \nChildren’s Health Insurance Program State Plan benefits by adding residential \nand withdrawal management services consistent with the American Society of \nAddiction Medicine levels 3.1, 3.5 and 3.7. These are levels missing within \nNevada’s health scope for Medicaid recipients.  \n \nAllowing the DHCFP to apply for the 1115 Demonstration Waiver gives the \nState the flexibility to provide services proving their budget neutrality over the \nfive-year life of the waiver. This can be done by adherence to the robust CMS \nmeasurements and standards of neutrality. Nevada’s unique position with the \nsupport  grant  allows  us  to  leverage  the  expertise  and  guidance  we  have \nreceived and technical assistance and planning.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 2, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nIf we are selected for the Demonstration waiver, it will allow us to utilize the \nEnhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentages to cover the administrative \ncost of waiver development and implementation of this service. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nFrom the Health and Human Services policy side, we are asking to endorse the \nneed for beds; the backlog in emergency rooms is not appropriate. There are a \nlot of fiscal questions in terms of how we get started with the waiver, and we \nsuspect this bill will be pulled into the Finance Committee where we can dig \ndeeper into how this would affect the Medicaid budget specifically.  \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nYou stated four states have this waiver, is this correct? \n \nMS. COMLOSSY: \nThere are two separate waivers. The waiver for substance use disorder services \nis up to 31 states. The waiver the DHCFP is authorized to apply for, which \nrelates to individuals with serious mental illness or severe emotional disorder, is \nup to seven states. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nSince the number of waivers the DHCFP is authorized to apply for is so low, has \nit  been  difficult  for  states  to  get  their  waivers,  or  is  CMS  denying  waiver \napplications? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nThe CMS has advised states to apply for the substance use disorder waiver first \nand then use that as a template to apply for the waiver regarding serious mental \nillness and serious emotional disturbance. This is why those numbers are higher \non the substance use disorder side. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nSo states are making their way into a blind IMD waiver? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nYes, that is correct. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 2, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nSection 1, subsection 4, paragraph (b) defines a child with a serious emotional \ndisturbance and exempts mental disorders designated as a Code V disorder in \nthe Manual. Code V disorders are already not mental disorders by definition. \nThere may be some confusion in that wording. \n \nERIC ROBBINS (Counsel): \nI will look into any revisions that may be necessary. \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nWill there be funding to ensure law enforcement is trained in recognizing a \nmental illness if called to a crisis situation? Will there be anything done so the \nfamily called will not end up planning a funeral for the person in crisis? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThis  particular  bill  is  not  about  crisis  intervention.  We  are  well  past  that \nintervention with this bill. This person has now been evaluated and offered, or \nmandated  in  some  cases,  to  be  in  a  substance  use  disorder  or  psychiatric \ntreatment facility and in an inpatient bed. With this bill we are several steps past \nthe call to a law enforcement officer and crisis stabilization. \n \nSenate Bill 156 is about rebuilding the crisis stabilization system. While there is \nnot explicitly money for training law enforcement in that bill, it seeks to not \nhave law enforcement respond at all. Where you reduce the interaction between \nlaw enforcement and a person experiencing a behavioral health crisis, you have \na behavior health professional and peer with lived experience sent out to handle \nthe crisis. There will be another bill presented introducing the crisis call line and \nhow, who and where we dispatch the calls.  \n \nTo answer your question, there is no funding in this or any other bills we heard \ntoday specifically directed at training for law enforcement, but overall, multiple \nbills are working on dramatic improvements to crisis response. In most cases, \nwe are trying not to send out law enforcement and ensuring when we do send \nlaw enforcement, we have a better outcome. \n \nALLISON  ZEDNICEK,  CEO  (Desert  Parkway  Behavioral  Healthcare  Hospital,  Las \nVegas, Reno Behavioral Healthcare Hospital): \nI support S.B. 154. This bill would increase access exponentially, especially in \nthe north where it is limited. When I am working with our hospital CEOs and \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 2, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \ndirectors of the emergency rooms, the majority of patients remaining are waiting \nfor state beds and on Medicaid. There is a gap in services since we are not able \nto treat patients and be compensated for Medicaid, often acquiring quite a bit of \ncharity when we  have patients with Medicaid.  We are also 30 percent less \ncostly  than  the  short-term  acute  hospitals.  In  the  long  run,  the  IMD  would \ncreate a cost savings.  \n \nThis would also help bypass the emergency rooms creating a direct relationship \nwith mobile crisis, metro police officers and all agencies in the north responding \nto crises in the communities. Our full intention would be to partner and bypass \nthe emergency room with individuals coming directly to us. It allows a more \nprogressive way of thinking as explained by Mr. Young and Dr. Woodard with \nregard to having additional funding available. \n \nMS. REEDY: \nThe National Alliance on Mental Illness supports S.B. 154. I will read from my \nwritten testimony (Exhibit H). \n \nLEA CASE (Nevada Psychiatric Association): \nI echo the comments from the two previous speakers and support S.B. 154. \n \nSTEVEN COHEN: \nI echo the comments from previous speakers and support S.B. 154. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nI would like to express gratitude to the Nevada Psychiatric Association who \nadvocated for this bill at the Washoe Regional Behavioral Health Policy Board \nwith the Interim Committee on Health Care.

(BDR 40-416) \n \nSARA CHOLHAGIAN (Executive Director, Patient Protection Commission): \nI will provide you with an overview of the Patient Protection Commission, their \nwork,  the  process  and  how  these  measures  came  about  (Exhibit  B).  The \nCommission was created by S.B. No. 544 of the 80th Session, sponsored by \nthe Governor, and received unanimous bipartisan support. \n \nThe Commission is comprised of healthcare experts, advocates, providers and \nindustry  professionals  who  systematically  review  issues  related  to  the \nhealthcare  needs  of  State  residents  including  quality,  accessibility  and \naffordability,  and  prescription  drugs.  The  Commission  also  makes \nrecommendations to the Governor and Legislature to improve health care for all \nNevadans. \n \nThe goal of S.B. 5 is to enact legislation to codify telehealth flexibilities granted \nduring  the  Covid-19  public  health  emergency,  specifically  aimed  to  increase \npatient access to high-quality care while reducing costs and improving patient \nand provider safety through the inclusion of clear, effective and sustainable \ntelemedicine language in the Nevada Revised Statutes. \n \nThe  request  expands  service  by  establishing  all-payer  parity,  requiring  a \nthird-party  payer  to  cover  services  provided  through  telehealth  in  the  same \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \namount as services provided in person, except for services using a standard \ntelephone.  It  also  requires  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services \n(DHHS) to establish a data dashboard allowing for analysis of data relating to \naccess to telehealth. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIs a cellular telephone considered a standard telephone? \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nIt does. I would like DuAne Young to specifically respond to the question. \n \nDUANE  YOUNG  (Deputy  Administrator,  Division  of  Health  Care  Financing  and \nPolicy, Department of Health and Human Services): \nThis language is in standard Nevada Revised Statutes, and it does apply to both \nlandline and cellular devices. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe provision of telehealth will include services provided through a standard \ntelephone, but they can be billed differently. Is this correct? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nYes.  The  telephone  is  restricted  by  the  federal  government  because  it  is  a \nnon-HIPPA compliant platform. This federal regulation is governed by the Office \nof  Civil  Rights  within  the  Department  of  Justice.  Language  in  the  Nevada \nRevised Statutes (NRS) 422 states \"to the extent applicable\" which gives S.B. 5 \nthe  authority  to  allow  telephone  if  it  were  to  be  allowed  by  the  federal \ngovernment \"to the extent applicable.\" It also sets up the Division of Health \nCare Financing and Policy (DHCFP) for the discretion to not pay parity. Nevada \nRevised Statute 422 requires parity for in-person services in telehealth; this \nwould allow us to set up a separate modifier for telephone delivered services, \nand we could pay them at a different rate than what we have paid traditional \ntelehealth or in-person visits. \n \nI serve as part of the Western States Pact for the Governor's Office, and a \nportion of this language is something other states have done. When they face a \nbudget shortfall or crisis, they do not have to cut rates across the board. They \ncan set payments from those services delivered via telephone versus those by \ntelephone  only,  particularly  when  they  are  dealing  with  providers  who  are \ncost-based reimbursed. The challenges of buying telehealth equipment or setting \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nup shop for in-person visits are taken into consideration and billing those rates \nas opposed to making a telephone call. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIf I am using a software application on my telephone, am I using a telephone or \nam I using a technology service in the broader definition of telehealth? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nThis is the modality, so if this is a standard telehealth visit, there are audiovisual \nrequirements. If it is telephone, there is a certain audio requirement. There are \napps  utilizing  remote  patient  monitoring  codes.  Those  are  different  current \nprocedural terminology (CPT) codes which are billed usually in conjunction with \nanother visit. Nevada does not currently cover those codes. Usually working \nthrough a health app is not part of the reimbursement process in working with a \nphysician. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThere is some discussion about the types of definitions allowed, provided by \nsynchronous  or  asynchronous  technology.  Is  it  your  belief  the  definition  is \ncovered under our existing statute? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nYes, it is covered under NRS 422, the section governing Nevada Medicaid. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nWho  would  be  able  to  access  this  all-payer  system?  Is  the  information \naggregated and who has the ability to pull information? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThere is some confusion between the two bills we are hearing today because \nboth bills have a data collection component. The claims database is actually in \nanother bill that will be discussed later today. I understand why there might be \nconfusion.  Senate  Bill  5  also  has  some  data  collection  components. \nMs. Cholhagian, could you please provide clarification? \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nSenate Bill 5 is not a data collection bill but mirrors a similar bill we will hear \ntoday. Senate Bill 5 puts the burden on the State to utilize the best resources of \ndata collection efforts done within the State. There is no burden on any payers \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nor insurance to submit data for the dashboard. The intent is for the State to \nutilize existing information to create the dashboard. The idea behind it was you \ncannot improve what you cannot measure. When you look at health and want \nto  address  equitable  access  for  patients  in  our  State,  you  want  to  have \nmeasurement of the data. The creation of the data dashboard is the first step to \nmeasure  telehealth  access  to  address  equitable  access  and  start  looking  at \nvulnerable populations. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nAm I understanding correctly that whoever is the administrator of the dashboard \nonly would have access to the data itself; the rest would be publicly available in \nthe dashboard. \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nYes. Sections 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 of this bill establish the parameters for the \nDHHS to create this data dashboard. There is a requirement it get posted on the \nagency website as well as the Commission website. If you are familiar with data \ndashboards the State has produced related to Covid-19, it is very similar. The \nagency is going to create a data dashboard which will be housed on the DHHS \nwebsite as well as the Commission's website so consumers can see and access \nthe  data;  however,  it  is  created  by  DHHS.  There  is  no  data  released  or \nrequested in this bill as it is only about the creation of the data dashboard. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nWill it be DHHS who will put into place all of the protections around the data? \nWhen we get personalized data, we want to see how the data is allowed to be \nused and who can control it. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThis bill does not contemplate any new data collection. It only uses data the \nState already has, for example, Medicaid claims covered by HIPAA and all the \nrules for Medicaid, or the number of individuals who are receiving respite care. It \nis only the data the State already owns. An effort is being made by DHHS to \ncreate a data unit by pooling all the statistician data people into one unit. \n \nThe bill asks we take all the data and put it into a dashboard which makes data \nunderstandable to the general public and all of us. It is less about new data. \nWhatever protections are currently in place for the data still stand, and this bill \ndoes not do anything about that. The next bill we will be hearing does have a \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nlot of questions about data because it is new data. This bill is about taking the \ndata we currently have under existing protections and presenting it in a useful \nway. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nThis helps. I worry a bit about consumer protection, and anytime you centralize \na large amount of data, even if you already have access to it, there are some \nquestions. However, your explanation makes sense. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nMs. Cholhagian, can you speak to the nature of how this data is intended to be \npresented, I am assuming aggregated, and identified? There is nothing in the \ndashboard  that  would  have  any  individual  records  or  information  about  any \nindividual patient, is this accurate? \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nYes. Kyra Morgan from the Division of Public and Behavioral Health (DPBH) will \nlater provide testimony on the proposed amendment (Exhibit C); however, she is \navailable now to answer your specific question. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nMs. Morgan, could you talk about data the State now has and is currently \nprotected? \n \nKYRA MORGAN (Chief Biostatistician, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nThe information on the data dashboard and our amendment will be addressed in \npublic comment at the end of the hearing; however, all the data we present \nwould be aggregated. There would not be anything to identify a person on an \nindividual level. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI have similar questions regarding the creation of a data dashboard which allows \nfor the analysis of telehealth by different groups and populations which must: \n\"Allow for the user to sort data based on the race, ethnicity, ancestry, national \norigin,  color,  sex,  sexual  orientation,\"  etc.,  as  stated  in  S.B. 5,  section  1, \nsubsection 1, paragraph (a), subparagraph (2). Do we actually have data for \nindividuals which can then be disaggregated or aggregated? I am not sure how \nyou did the data collection and how you use it. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nMS. MORGAN: \nThis is actually applicable to the amendment we submitted from DBPH. It adds \nlanguage around the dashboard for us to collect and present data, contingent on \nwhat data is available and within federal regulations. It is likely the dashboard \nwill be a subset of what is essentially the big goal from the Commission, but we \nwill be able to include at an aggregate level as much information as possible.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWhat are you going to do with it?   \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nThe intent of the data dashboard is the first step to measure telehealth access, \naddress equitable access and look into vulnerable populations. It requires DHHS \nto  create  the  data  dashboard,  and  the  agency  must  utilize  it  in  the \ndecision-making process. \n \nIn  addition,  the  data  dashboard  ties  in  other  advisory  boards  in  the  State, \nincluding  the  Commission,  Commission  on  Behavioral  Health,  five  regional \nbehavioral health policy boards, as well as the Legislative Committee on Health \nCare. These entities will review the data dashboard and include it in the review \nof  their  own  policies.  It  is  looking  at  the  long-term  recovery  and  aiming  to \naddress health equity to ensure we create and have good data that is available \nand review and put it into consideration for future policy decisions, in addition \nto ensuring it is on the Commission website. The thought behind this was to \nmake sure patients and consumers would be able to easily access and review \nthe information themselves and also be able to opine on it. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIs someone else doing this, and is it working somewhere? \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nThe State of Colorado is doing this and has built an equitable dashboard using \nthe same thought process as the Commission's intent. I am not aware of any \nother state doing this. DuAne Young may be able to speak to this because as he \nmentioned earlier, we are part of the telehealth multistate collaborative. \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nYes, Colorado has done this. This did not particularly influence the decision of \nthe  Commission,  but  other  states  within  the  Western  States  Pact,  such  as \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nCalifornia, are looking at this as well. It is important to have this data centered \nin certain areas of our State where telehealth is heavily relied on, such as rural \nand urban areas which do not necessarily have the healthcare infrastructure and \nhad a difficult transition in the pandemic. Having this type of data and knowing \nhow the services are delivered will help us figure out how to more equitably \naddress grants when they are available and how to better support providers \nwho have not made and are having difficulty making the transition. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe may not know the race, gender and ethnicity of an individual patient, but \nwe  may  be  able  to  see  utilization  patterns  within  the  Medicaid  telehealth \nutilization. We may be able to overlay the data with neighborhoods where we \nhave  census  information  and  where  we  might  know  if  there  are  higher \nconcentrations of people of color, for example. This would give us not only a \npatient-by-patient piece of information but meaningful information in terms of \nequity and how we are doing in terms of access to services. We can look at \npeople who have generally not had access, such as people of color or lower \nincome neighborhoods. Is this the idea? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nYes. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nDo you have the ability in data collection to share information from certain \ncategories,  such  as  sexual  orientation  or  gender  identity,  so  it  is  not  just \none particular portion of health care and we do not have the information for \nanother? Once you collect the data with the appropriate information redacted, \ndo you have the ability to share it with other internal agencies? \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nThe intent is to share the information and have it housed on the DHHS website, \nas well as the Commission website, and for those other public bodies and the \npublic to review the dashboard. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nPolicy  will  be  directed  based  upon  that.  For  example,  if  you  can  get \none particular demographic hardest hit with Covid-19, you will direct resources \nto the community so the underlying mobilities would be addressed in the case of \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nanother  pandemic.  You  would  also  be  able  to  do  some  other  things  like \nprevention education. This is helpful information. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nRegarding the data analysis and policy recommendations, are you specifically \nasking for eight different boards to provide policy advice to you? \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nThe intent is to have them included in their review process. Whether they make \nit a priority is going to be at the discretion of each public body. We are making \nit known we intend for the data dashboard to be created and to be reviewed.  \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nMy follow-up question on the telehealth issue is related to behavioral health \nparity and whether it creates a disparity for behavioral health services in terms \nof reimbursement disparities being solely telephonic. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nCould you please clarify your question because there are two things in your \nquestion: behavioral health parity versus modality parity? \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nBehavioral health services may be fully adequate provided over a telephonic \nmeans, but then are we reducing reimbursement for a service which may be \nfully appropriate for a telephonic service? \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nThe intent of the Commission's bill was to allow for increased access through \npayment  parity  on  all-payer  parity  insurers,  but  recognizing  the  use  of  a \nstandard  telephone  may  not  warrant  the  same  type  of  payment  parity  or \nstandard of care. The Commission did not want to restrict the use of a standard \ntelephone but also recognized it does not want to change the standard of care \nin saying it is the same as in-person service. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWas there any discussion about whether this was an appropriate decision for \nmental health services as well as physical health care? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nYes, there was discussion about telehealth access particularly for behavioral \nhealth, but it was not included specifically in this measure. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI understand there is movement at the national level. We are in an uncertain \ntime  right  now  in  terms  of  reimbursement  for  telephone  only  or  voice  only \nversus a full true telehealth solution. If we wanted telephone to be fully within \nparity, we would also be saying the State would have to pay 100 percent \nbecause it is not a Medicaid reimbursement. We are waiting to see if the federal \ngovernment moves on this. You said earlier the bill is written in such a way if \nthere is movement, it would be a benefit to us and all Nevadans. Could you \nplease tell us a little bit more about this? \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nYes, there are conversations at the federal level. This is a federal regulation \ngoverned  in  HIPAA  by  the  Office  of  Civil  Rights  within  the  Department  of \nJustice. During the pandemic and declaration of public emergency, the Office of \nCivil Rights made non-HIPPA compliant platforms which include telephone. They \ndecided not to enforce the prohibition on those so the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid  Services  (CMS)  provided  a  directive  this  could  be  reimbursed  and \nutilized.  The  State  then  covered  it  in  a  section  1135  waiver  of  the  Social \nSecurity Act. \n \nWe are reimbursing for telephone services with certain exceptions. Back to the \nlanguage in NRS, if the federal government were to move on this, and the \nexisting language within this law was not modified to the extent applicable, we \nwould be able to receive reimbursement or match. We interpreted this as our \nability,  if  the  federal  government  were  to  allow  this  and  we  were  to  get \nmatched,  to  certainly  continue  those  flexibilities.  If  not,  we  would  continue \noperating under NRS 422, the telehealth provisions as cited in our chapter as \nwe have been. \n \nNot changing this language gives us the discretion we have used during the \npandemic  through  our  Covid-19  memos  to  provide  further  guidance  about \nservices  which  were  and  were  not  traditionally  allowed  for  telehealth  but \ncertainly  not  appropriate  for  telephone.  We  have  done  this  with  some \nrehabilitative mental health services as well as some health services on the \nmedical  side.  We  have  provided  the  guidance  on  our  website  and \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nannouncements to providers. We do not see this bill as changing anything in our \noperation but allowing for this enhancement and allowing us to take advantage \nshould the federal government move in a different way. We would then craft \nparameters  in  permanent  policy  around  the  reimbursements  for  telephone \nservices if reimbursed by the federal government. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe federal government would have to address the HIPAA issue, and then CMS \nwould have to address the reimbursement issue. \n \nMR. YOUNG: \nCorrect. \n \nCLAUDIA DUCK TUCKER (Teladoc): \nWe  support  S.B.  5  and  I  have  provided  written  testimony  (Exhibit  D).  We \nsupport  legislation  to  codify  telehealth  flexibilities  granted  during  Covid-19 \npublic health emergency into law. The clarifications to the telehealth statutes \nwill  ensure  the  latest  innovations  in  technology  such  as  asynchronous \ncommunications  are  compliant  with  Nevada  law  to  allow  remote  patient \nmonitoring which is critical to those with diabetes and cardiovascular disease. \n \nWe encourage language which will allow for expanded access to expert medical \nsecond opinion services to the best specialist in the Country without incurring \nthe cost and inconvenience of travel. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThere  is  an  S.B.  5  amendment  request,  (Exhibit  E),  submitted  on  behalf  of \nTeladoc. It is focused on the definitions and some of the other pieces in this bill. \n \nWe understand from our legal counsel, if the definition is inclusive and we start \nlisting  things  out  of  it,  we  may  have  some  unintended  consequences. \nMs. Tucker,  why  do  you  think  the  bill  as  written  does  not  include  the \ntechnologies you are concerned about? \n \nMS. TUCKER: \nI think it is unclear to laymen, our clients, who read this, but is quite clear to me \nas  I  live  this  every  day.  Anytime  we  can  clarify  statutes  so  everyone \nunderstands it, we are all better for it. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nMr. Robbins, please speak to what you think the bill says or does in terms of \ninclusivity and clarity. \n \nERIC ROBBINS (Counsel): \nThis is mainly dealing with more of the existing language of NRS 629.515. The \ndefinition  talks  about  the  use  of  information  and  audiovisual  communication \ntechnology. I do not interpret \"and\" to mean you have to have both or it is not \ntelehealth. It can be either one; the \"and\" just means the definition of telehealth \nincludes both of those things. The store and forward technology falls within the \ndefinition.  \n \nNevada Revised Statutes 629.515 does not authorize or prohibit anyone from \nengaging in any activity depending upon whether or not it is telehealth. It does \nnot say if it is not telehealth you cannot do it. It does not say if it is telehealth \nyou can do it. All it says is if you are going to use telehealth for the purposes \nprescribed in subsection 1, you have to be licensed in this State and the boards \nare  allowed  to  regulate  beyond  that.  Basically,  the  particular  statute  and \ndefinition are not about what people are allowed to do or not allowed to do. The \none exception is if you are doing the things described in subsection 1 through \ntelehealth, you have to have a license. \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nI have our attorney, Greg Ott, on the telephone who helped me review this and \nlooked up the clarification of the intent. \n \nGREG OTT (Chief Deputy Attorney General, Office of the Attorney General): \nI  agree  with  Mr.  Robbins  and  came  to  the  same  conclusion  regarding  the \nstatute. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nYou  are  both  saying  it  is  broadly  written;  therefore,  it  can  be  inclusive  of \nanything. It really is only tied specifically to licensing. \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nYes. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nKYLE ZEBLEY (American Telemedicine Association): \nI am testifying in support of S.B. 5. I will read from my written testimony \n(Exhibit F) and offer the proposed amendments (Exhibit G) to this bill. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThere are similar concepts here. The peer-to-peer notion is not explicitly covered \nin State law and establishing the patient relationship pieces. Mr. Robbins, are \nthere any concerns about the language suggestion regarding peer-to-peer? \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nNo.  This  would  be  something  we  could  include.  It  would  not  be  legally \nproblematic, it would basically restrict the ability of the professional licensing \nboards to regulate these sort of consultations. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs  the  same  thing  true  in  terms  of  establishing  a  patient  relationship  by  a \ntelehealth visit currently requiring it be done in person? \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nIt is up to the individual boards who regulate the various healthcare professions. \nI am not sure what requirements they have, but it is up to their regulations, \nstandards and practice. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe notion of those two amendments is the Legislature dictating that versus the \nboards regulating it. \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nExactly. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nPeer-to-peer consultations happen all the time. If the peer-to-peer also have a \npatient in the middle of the peer-to-peer, can it charge the peer in the other \nstate or can the peer in the state of patient residence charge? Is it just allowing \na peer to talk to a peer? What does this proposed amendment do differently \nthan calling on the phone and talking to a specialist in Salt Lake City or in \nLos Angeles?  Does  it  mean  the  peer  in  Nevada  can  charge  the  patient's \ninsurance  or  patient  themselves?  What  about  the  conversation  a  doctor  in \nNevada has by talking to a doctor in Utah? Is this what we are talking about? \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nMR. ZEBLEY: \nThis is not in regards to reimbursement. It would just be the Legislature making \nclear it is an appropriate way to have telehealth interactions with another peer in \nanother state. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThis does not make sense. We can pick up the phone in Nevada and talk to \nsomeone at UCLA or University of Utah. Is it illegal now and we are going to \nmake it legal? \n \nMR. ZEBLEY: \nIt  would  be  making  it  explicitly  legal.  I  do  not  know  if  it  is  explicit  at  the \nmoment. I do not believe it is. \n \nCHARLIE SHEPARD (Nevada AARP): \nNevada AARP supports S.B. 5 since it will improve access to health care by \nincreasing the availability of telehealth for Nevada families who must rely on \nstandard telephones with audio only.  I  will read from my  written testimony \n(Exhibit H). \n \nJASMIN TOBON (Planned Parenthood): \nWe are in favor of S.B. 5 because making telehealth accessible through the \nstandard telephone would be a long-term investment in the health, safety and \nwell-being of Nevadans. Telehealth helps connect geographically isolated areas \nvitally important in health care, and is an essential tool in addressing the health \ndisparities for Indigenous and People of Color, rural and medically underserved \ncommunities.  The  removal  of  restrictions  and  increased  public  and  private \ncoverage  for  telehealth  due  to  Covid-19  has  allowed  providers  to  see  more \npatients  safely  and  efficiently.  This  temporary  expansion  has  provided  a \ndemonstration of what innovative, broadened access to telehealth can do. \n \nCHELSEA CAPURRO  (Health Services Coalition): \nWe oppose S.B. 5. Telehealth has great resources and we support the general \nconcept. We also support the data dashboard since it will be a great service to \nall of our members. We have concerns about the pay parity piece in this bill, \nwhich is why we are opposed. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nDALTON HOOKS (Nevada Self Insurers Association): \nWe oppose S.B. 5. We are concerned about the impact of audio only, as other \nasynchronistic modalities for the provision of medical services will have on the \nworkers compensation system. Section 7, which modifies NRS 616C.730, and \nsection  9,  which  redefines  the  definition  of  telehealth  as  contained  in \nNRS 629.515, are particularly concerning. \n \nWorkers compensation is not the same as general health insurance and the \nNevada Industrial Insurance Act represents a careful balancing of the interests \nof multiple parties including employers, insurers, third-party administrators and \ninjured workers. The initiation of a claim under the Act involves reporting a \npotential workplace injury to the employer and seeking appropriate medical care. \nThis involves assessment by a medical professional who would, of necessity, \nneed to see injuries and signs of an illness. Aside from finding a diagnosis, the \nprofessionals are charged under the Act with opining as to whether upon their \nexamination or told by the allegedly injured worker, they can \"directly connect \nthe injury or occupational disease as being job incurred.\" This is not the same as \na doctor in private practice. \n \nWe are concerned about secondary gain and fraud issues, identity verification, \nmalingering and lack of nonverbal observations. Increasing the complexity in the \nsystem and lack of adequate definition under NRS 629.515 to include which \nmodalities could be done via telehealth. For these reasons, we oppose this bill in \nits current form. \n \nTOM CLARK (Nevada Association of Health Plans): \nWe  oppose  S.B.  5.  We  do  have  some  concerns,  however.  We  recommend \ninsurers  continue  to  have  the  flexibility  to  negotiate  prices  to  keep  health \ncoverage affordable for the consumer. Services provided by telehealth must be \ncomparable to the services provided in an office visit. Insurers and providers \nmust be able to establish different reimbursement rates based on the clinical \neffectiveness  and  intensity  of  the  business.  It  is  important  to  develop \nvalue-based arrangements by focusing on health outcomes, not just the volume \nof  services  provided.  The  payment  parity  provision  is  contradictory  to \ntelehealth's cost effectiveness. If telehealth can help reduce costs by using the \nhealth  care  system  to  reduce  provider  visits,  it  is  contradictory  to  mandate \nthose services be paid at the same rate. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nDEBI REYNOLDS (Deputy Administrator, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nThe proposed amendment brought forward by DHHS allows us to collect and \nreport on the data currently available to us. The bill as written does not refer to \ndata only available to us at this time. We understood it to mean we would need \nto reach out and collect the data which is why there is such a large fiscal note \non it. The amendment as proposed would allow us to remove our fiscal note. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThis is in line with the testimony on the bill intended to collect existing data and \nshare it. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI need clarification on the amendments we are discussing, as there are several. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe Teladoc and American Telemedicine Association (ATA) amendments were \naddressed under support of S.B. 5 and questions about those amendments were \nanswered.  We  are  now  focused  on  the  amendment  from  DHHS,  and  the \nadministrators will discuss whatever data and funding are available, followed by \ninformation about the dashboard. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nIt has been made clear we are going to be using data we are already collecting, \nso there is no additional expense there. I imagine the creation of the dashboard \nitself is still going to cost something, correct? \n \nMS. MORGAN: \nWe  are  confident  with  our  current  staff  and  software  we  can  build  the \ndashboard by using existing resources. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nMs. Morgan, your colleagues testified this amendment would remove the fiscal \nnote. Is this your assessment as well? \n \nMS. MORGAN: \nCorrect. The amendment clarifies language to strengthen it and ensures we are \nnot relying on additional data collection. We would use the data and resources \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nalready available to create the dashboard, which would eliminate the fiscal note \nfrom DPBH. \n \nHELEN FOLEY (Delta Dental): \nWe support the DHHS amendment. The language to the \"extent resources and \ndata are available,\" satisfies our needs and concerns. Delta Dental does support \ntelehealth and has been working on these issues throughout the United States. \nOur initial concern was there might be intrusive questions asked of a patient \nsuch as gender identify, sexual orientation and if the patient has mental health \nproblems. We did not feel those questions were appropriate. This amendment \nonly includes data already available and reassures us over concerns we had. We \ndo not have an objection to the legislation. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThis bill has nothing to do with preventing a doctor from talking to a doctor \nsomewhere else, nor does it have anything to do with getting payment for that, \nnor does it allow or not allow a doctor from talking to another patient's family \nor a family caregiver, nor does it allow payment for the interchange because it is \nalready going on. Even though it is not specifically allowed, it is what we do \nanyway, and this bill does not change nor reimburse for this, correct? \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nCorrect. There may be questions related to one of the proposed amendments \nseeking to modify this. \n \nMR. OTT: \nYes, it is also my understanding. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe original amendment is the peer-to-peer piece in both the ATA and Teledoc \namendments, or is it just in the ATA amendment? \n \nMEGAN COMLOSSY (Analyst): \nIt is in both the ATA and Teledoc amendments. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nMr. Robbins, what is current law in terms of peer-to-peer interaction, and would \nthis amendment have an effect? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nUnder Nevada law, it is up to the individual statutes and regulations governing \nthe  different  professions.  For  physicians  in  particular,  NRS  630.047 \nsubsection 1, paragraph (b), says physicians do not have to have licenses if \nthey are consulting with or providing assistance to a Nevada licensed physician \nand they are legally qualified to practice in the state where they reside. The \nstatute does not exclusively mention telehealth,  but  where telehealth is not \nexplicitly  made  different,  we  interpret  the  same  provisions  which  apply  to \nin-person services apply to the provision of telehealth services. Consultation on \nan irregular basis for physicians is explicitly allowed by NRS 630. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe testimony from those who were seeking the amendment was they were \nlooking for it to be more explicit, but the testimony from our attorney is it is \nalready allowed. \n \nI will now close the hearing on S.B. 5. The hearing on S.B. 40 is now open. \n \nSENATE BILL 40: Provides for the collection of certain data relating to health \ncare. (BDR 40-415) \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nI will provide you with an overview of the Commission's activities and what led \nto S.B. 40, (Exhibit I). The intent of this measure seeks to enact mandated \nreporting of data to the Commission, DHHS and the Attorney General's Office \nto allow for the monitoring of the healthcare industry.  \n \nThis is another measure seeking to improve access to health care with the same \nmindset that you cannot improve what you cannot measure. This is the first \nstep to monitoring the healthcare industry and costs. Specifically, the request \ndoes five things which I will highlight for you and are specifically outlined in the \nattached Exhibit I. \n \nSection 20 of this bill requires an inventory of currently reported health data to \nbe used for analysis in costs/prices, consolidation and patient access to care. \nSection  14  requires  an  annual  report  summarizing  healthcare  quality  for \npresentation to the Governor, Legislature and Commission. Section 1 ensures \nthe Commission and DHHS have authority to request ad hoc reports.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nThe largest portion of this measure relates to the establishment of an All Payer \nClaims Database (APCD). In the last Session, Senator Spearman paved the way \nfor  this  conversation  to  happen  by  introducing  a  measure  which  sought  to \nestablish an APCD and, as a result of many conversations, is being included in \nthis  bill.  Senate  Bill  40  requires  DHHS  to  establish  an  APCD  relating  to \nhealthcare insurance claims provided in this State. Public and private insurers \nwho provide health benefits and are regulated under State law must submit data \nto the database, and certain insurers regulated by federal law may submit data \nto the database. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nThe standard for all health information will continue to be HIPAA. Who will have \naccess  to  this  database;  who  will  be  able  to  access  the  information  on  an \nindividual level; and what types of protections or parameters do we anticipate \nbeing put around access? \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nThis legislation focuses on authorizing the State to create the data dashboard \nand  establishing  regulations  to  include  the  data  collection  process  and  data \nrelease  process.  I  defer  to  Sandie  Ruybalid,  Chief  Information  Technology \nManager for the DHCFP and the guru of APCD efforts for our State. \n \nSANDIE RUYBALID (Chief Information Technology Manager, Division of Health Care \nFinancing and Policy, Department of Health and Human Services): \nTo answer the first question about security requirements, we would contract \nwith a third-party vendor. Part of the contracting process is requiring the party \nhave certifications: Health Information Trust Alliance certification which ensures \nthe party would comply with HIPAA regulations; and the National Institute of \nStandards  and  Technology  security  certification  and  requirements  which \nprotects the data we would house both in transit and stored and in release of \nthe data. As far as releasing the data, most of it would be de-identified and \naggregated. Someone would not be able to ping the database for one particular \npatient. Data released in an identified manner for research purposes would be \ngoverned  and  controlled  with  data  use  agreements  between  the  parties  to \nensure there is an agreement and liability so the data is not released improperly. \n \nMS. MORGAN: \nI would add we are already collecting all of this information on our Medicaid \npopulation. The security protocols we have in place to protect this information \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nwould be extended to this population. We also collect highly sensitive data \naround our communicable diseases, including HIV, where we have to maintain \nconfidentiality with the highest regard. We have a lot of processes in place to \nprotect  this  information.  This  would  be  an  extension  to  include  payers  not \nalready captured in some of our existing data collection mechanisms. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI have misgivings about section 5 which indicates a patient with all the other \nidentifications.  I  know  banks  are  hacked,  DETR  is  hacked  and  the  State  is \nhacked; there has not been an unhackable situation yet. This one takes an \nindividual  name,  social  security  number,  telephone  number,  medical  record \nnumber, health plan beneficiary number, license number, vehicle identification \nnumber, serial number, internet address, electronic billing, biometric identifier \nand photograph image. This is a recipe for disaster when someone hacks it. I \nhave major misgivings about this. This is more of a statement than a question. \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nI  can  tell  you  this  specific  language  was  not  included  in  the  Commission's \nrequest.  It  was  a  product  of  drafting  interpretation  and  indicating  it  was  a \nnecessary component of this measure. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThis  is  the  information  they  are  specifically  saying  cannot  be  released \nindividually and must be aggregated. This is a list of things we want to protect. \nCorrect? \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nThis is the definition of the term direct patient identifier. It is not saying the \ninformation is going to be necessarily included in the APCD. It is just saying if \nany information does wind up in the APCD, it has to be treated in a certain \nmanner under section 13. The people who have access to information are very \nlimited, especially with respect to other types of information possibly in the \ndatabase. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIf  any  of  the  information  makes  it  into  the  APCD,  are  we  protecting  the \nindividual identifying information? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nYes. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI think when we discussed it last Session, there were concerns around this as \nwell. The State of Washington has something very similar, and I know they \nhave increased security on this type of information. A lot of the information is \nredacted, so other than researching or trying to establish what the patterns are, \nI do not know if there is identifiable information on a person. Some of the \nprotections  are  in  redaction,  ensuring  when  it  is  disaggregated  there  is  no \ninformation that could identify an individual. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nTime  has  passed  since  we  looked  at  this  concept  two  years  ago. \nMs. Cholhagian, could you talk about the number of states who have APCDs \nand what is happening at the federal level around APCD? \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nI am aware of 19 states with established APCDs. There is a national effort \nunder the No Surprises Act to entice other states to create APCDs. There is also \nan  opportunity  for  federal  funding  which  is  a  noncompetitive  application \nprocess. I will defer to Ms. Ruybalid about the federal grant process she is \nmonitoring as well as what other states are doing. \n \nMS. RUYBALID: \nThere are 19 to 23 databases in existence in varying sizes. There is a lot of \ninterest at the federal level. There is a noncompetitive grant for all states to \napply. The funding would be available in October, and we intend to apply for \nthe grant. There is $2.5 million available over a period of two and one-half years \nto either improve your existing database or establish an APCD. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nCan you also talk about what data is typically collected in an APCD? \n \nMS. RUYBALID: \nAt the base level, it is claims data. What would be included in normal standard \nclaims transaction is what is included in an APCD. Some states have decided to \nhave  other  feeds  into  the  database  to  help  enrich  their  data.  At  the  very \nminimum, it is claims data. We would not find a vehicle identification number or \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nbiometric information as described in section 5. I am sure some other states \nhave done this; maybe they have connections and needs for the data. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe intent of this legislation is claims data so we are talking about a patient, \nwhat the patient's condition was, what was billed and what was paid. The point \nof this bill is for us to understand how much health care costs so we can start \nto make informed decisions about how we invest our dollars in terms of health \ncare and how we manage healthcare costs. \n \nMS. RUYBALID: \nCorrect.  \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nGoing back to the prior bill, S.B. 5, with the social security number, I suspect \nthey can figure out age. The comment made about age apparently is not in this? \nHave any of these 19 to 23 states ever had a data breach from their database? \n \nMS. RUYBALID: \nI am not aware of any data breaches in APCD. The nature of the data housed in \nthe  databases  is  very  important,  and  we  focus  on  security  and  privacy  of \ninformation.  There  are  strict  standards  in  place  for  the  technology  and  the \nbehavior of anyone housing the data. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWould the social security number typically be in an insurance claim? \n \nMS. RUYBALID: \nNot generally, no. We would not want to collect data which is not necessary \njust because of the risks. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIn 2011, the State Health Information Exchange talked a lot about individual \npatients'  ability  to  make  decisions  regarding  whether  they  wanted  their \ninformation uploaded into a government-run system. The way I read this bill, \nyou  cannot  have  private  insurance  or  public  insurance  without  having  your \nhealthcare claims submitted to this database. Is there an opt-out? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nMS. RUYBALID: \nI have seen other states include opt-out language of identifiable data. Again, the \ndata we would publicly publish would be aggregated data. It would not have \nany unique patient identifiers. The only time direct patient identifiers would be \nreleased is in the case of researchers requesting data. We would have strict \ndata use agreements in place. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nI understand we try to protect the data as best as we can, but when we hold it \nall in one place, it becomes a target. I share Dr. Hardy's concerns about an \nindividual who is potentially required to carry health insurance, then have the \ndata  collected  by  the  health  insurance  company  as  a  part  of  the  payment \nsystem and be required to be turn over data to the government for analysis. It is \nmore of a philosophical statement than a question. \n \nASHER LISEC (PhRMA): \nWe  support  S.B.  40  and  the  APCD.  We  have  submitted  two  clarifying \namendments (Exhibit J). This will help highlight the cost drivers in the State and \nprovide important Nevada-specific data on healthcare costs. The first relates to \nthe  definition  of  proprietary  financial  information  in  section  7.  The  second \namendment relates to section 20. If there is a report released and available, the \nreport should consider race, ethnicity and other health disparities. This is an \nimportant area for the State to consider—especially given the pandemic and \ninequities we have seen in health care. It would not require DHHS to collect any \nadditional information, but consider if you can determine information based on \nneighborhood or zip code. We have reviewed amendments submitted by others, \nand PhRMA has some concerns with the amendment offered by the Office of \nthe Attorney General in section 1, subsection 2. We look forward to seeing the \npassage of S. B. 40. \n \nMR. CLARK: \nWe support this bill. I am speaking to a conceptual amendment on S.B. 40 on \nbehalf  of  Nevada  Association  of  Health  Plans,  Nevada  Hospital  Association, \nNevada  State  Medical  Association  and  Pharmaceutical  Care  Management \nAssociation (Exhibit K). The APCD will be a tool for public policy which will \nbenefit  Nevada  long-term.  We  want  to  make  it  robust,  accurate  and  as \nuncomplicated as possible. I will speak to sections 9 through 14 and section 17. \nBill Welch will discuss section 8 regarding needed definitions Exhibit K. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \nBILL WELCH (Nevada Hospital Association): \nWe support S.B. 40. I will speak specifically about section 8 and the definitions \nas outlined in Exhibit K. \n \nKATIE RYAN (Dignity Health – St. Rose Dominican): \nWe support the conceptual amendment submitted on behalf of Nevada Hospital \nAssociation and passage of S.B. 40. \n \nMS. CAPURRO: \nOn behalf of the Health Services Coalition, we support S.B. 40. We want to be \non the record to ensure anything in the APCD is HIPAA compliant for our clients \nand should there be any sort of data breach, our clients are not responsible. \n \nBOBBETTE BOND (Culinary Health Fund): \nWe support S.B. 40. By way of disclosure, I am a member of the Commission \nbut am here on behalf of the Culinary Health Fund. We support the bill in its \ncurrent  version.  We  support  the  legislation  for  three  reasons:  Current  State \nhealthcare  transparencies  are  incomplete  and  behind  many  states;  it  is  an \nimportant vehicle to monitor and evaluate the healthcare system going forward; \nand  it  is  an  important  foundation  for  new  models,  price  and  quality \nmanagement. \n \nThe Employee Retirement Income Security Act plans are optional; individuals \ncan participate by choice. The product has to be transparent, and so it is a \nprocess. We support the program being housed within the public health arena \nand urge the Senate Committee on Health and Human Services to pass the bill \nas  created,  not  the  bill  as  amended  by  the  stakeholder  amendments. \nParticularly, we oppose legislation which would de-identify the elements needed \nin a database, such as the provider, facility and price paid for services or care. \nWe need this information for the database to work. The database should also \nspan  times.  The  amendments  we  heard  about  today  indicate  the  database \nwould not include these elements; trends are important so we want to make \nsure the  data is included. We want to ensure the committees assigned are \nadvisory only and not in charge of deciding what data would be submitted in the \nend. This enabling legislation has a long way to go in the regulatory process, \nbut we support the program as it develops. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \nCHRIS BOSSE (Renown Health): \nWe support S.B. 40 with the conceptual amendments offered by the industry \nstakeholders. We appreciate the work the Commission has done to prioritize the \nimplementation  of  an  APCD  in  Nevada.  The  Commission  recognized  the \nimportant impact an APCD could have. The industry stakeholder group came \ntogether providing feedback on S.B. 40 to ensure best practices and lessons \nlearned  from  other  states  were  incorporated  on  the  front  end  of  our \nimplementation. The recommendations the industry has proposed will ensure \nsuccessful implementation, operation and meaningful use of the APCD as early \nas it can be recognized. \n \nDAN MUSGROVE (Valley Health System of Hospitals): \nWe support S.B. 40. We also support the conceptual amendments submitted by \nthe stakeholders, led by Bill Welch and Tom Clark. We want to look at the best \npractices of other states and want to have the best bill we possibly can. \n \nKATIE ROBBINS (Planned Parenthood): \nWe support S.B. 40. The ability for the Commission to create an APCD will be \nan important tool in identifying how we can improve care and costs for all \nNevadans. Having a more holistic understanding of quality, efficiency and cost \nof care is a good step toward making health care more equitable and fair in \nNevada, something we know is critically needed. \n \nMARK KRUEGER (Chief Deputy Attorney General, Office of the Attorney General): \nI am testifying as neutral and will explain the amendment submitted (Exhibit L). \nThere  seems  to  be  unintended  consequences  with  capturing  confidential \ninvestigations by the Office of the Attorney General. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe need clarification on the second piece of your amendment. \n \nMR. KRUEGER: \nThe second piece is in section 13. Under our Unfair Trade Practices Act under \nNRS 598A, we conduct confidential investigations and many times we work \nwith the Federal Trade Commission, Department of Justice, under a court order \nor with other states. The unintended consequence of not exempting out the \nconfidentiality of those investigations would put us at odds with our federal or \nstate partners or a court in our ability to continue our investigations, which we \nalready have authority under NRS 598A. Exempting us out from the reporting of \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \ninformation  we  receive  during  those  investigations  would  protect  that \ninformation and allow us to conduct our investigation. If information becomes \npublic at a later time, we have no objection to cooperating with the Commission \nand turning information over to the extent we can. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nYou believe there is language in this bill which would prohibit activities you are \nalready doing? \n \nMR. KRUEGER: \nThe bill's language will not prohibit us from doing the activities but will make it \nimpossible for us to do activities with our federal or state partners. It would act \nas  a  barrier  for  us  being  able  to  conduct  our  thorough  investigations  into \nantitrust. Ironically, these are the exact reasons for the bill and intent, to take a \npeek  at  healthcare  costs  and  make  sure  the  healthcare  costs  have  good \ncompetition in the marketplace. At the same time, we might be able to benefit \nin  our  investigations  by  seeing  certain  information  from  the  Commission \ncollected through this bill. The information, to the extent we could receive and \nconduct investigations under our authority, may also help us while making sure \nthe markets are competitive and robust. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs it specifically the claims data we anticipate being in the database you are \nconcerned about? \n \nMR. KRUEGER: \nNo, it is not specifically the claims data, it is going back to section 1. It is the \ndata regarding the cost of health care and particularly, consolidation among \nentities who provide for health care. It is the market data, anticompetitive or \ncompetitive behavior. \n \nCHRIS NEAL (CarFax): \nI am testifying as neutral and will read from my written testimony (Exhibit M) to \npropose an amendment to S.B. 40. We believe the current definition of \"direct \npatient  identifier\"  in  the  bill  requires  amendment.  The  vehicle  identification \nnumber should be stricken from the list of identifiers. The current definitions of \n\"direct\"  and  \"indirect\"  patient  identifiers  should  reclassify  the  license  plate \nnumber to \"indirect identifier\" given its public visibility and inability to identify \nan individual. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 27 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIn section 1, subsection 2 the Commission is empowered to mandate analysis of \nhealthcare information from local governments. Have you received any feedback \nfrom those local governments on this language? \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nI have not received any feedback from local governments on this language, but \nwould be happy to reach out and connect with them and come back to you. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIt is one thing to get a report or request an existing report, but requiring another \ngovernmental entity to do an analysis of information is something new. \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nSection 1 states the Commission may request a report which would happen in \nthe form of a public meeting or a public request by the Commission. The local \ngovernments would be properly notified of what the Commission is intending to \nrequest. It is not an automatic mandate on the local governments. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will now close the hearing on S.B. 40. One of the two concepts brought \nforward today is making sure gains, in terms of use and access of telehealth \nduring  the  state  of  emergency,  could  continue  after  the  emergency  is \ncompleted. The second concept is taking a significant step forward toward the \ntransparency of health care so we can manage costs. \n \nMs. Cholhagian, please talk about the exciting announcement made today about \na project which includes Nevada. \n \nMS. CHOLHAGIAN: \nI am happy to share the news Nevada has been selected to participate in a \nmultistate collaborative effort with Peterson-Milbank Foundation on a program \nto address sustainable healthcare costs. I anticipate further discussion on this \nproject at the Commission's next meeting on March 15. \n   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 28 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nHearing no public comment, the meeting is adjourned at 5:56 p.m. \n \n  \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nNorma Mallett, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 9, 2021 \nPage 29 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nExhibit  Begins \nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \nLetter  on Page \n  A  1    Agenda \nSara Cholhagian / \nS.B. 5  B  1  Patient Protection  Presentation \nCommission \nKyra Morgan / \nS.B. 5  C  1  Department of Health  Proposed Amendment \nand Human Services \nClaudia Duck Tucker / \nS.B. 5  D  1  Written Testimony \nTeladoc \nClaudia Duck Tucker / \nS.B. 5  E  1  Proposed Amendment \nTeladoc \nKyle Zebley / American \nS.B. 5  F  1  Telemedicine  Written Testimony \nAssociation \nKyle Zebley / American \nS.B. 5  G  1  Telemedicine  Proposed Amendment \nAssociation \nS.B. 5  H  1  Charlie Shepard / AARP  Support Statement \nSara Cholhagian / \nS.B. 40  I  1  Patient Protection  Presentation \nCommission \nS.B. 40  J  1  Asher Lisec / PhRMA  Proposed Amendment \nTom Clark / Nevada \nS.B. 40  K  1  Association of Health  Proposed Amendment \nPlans  \nBill Welch / Nevada \nS.B. 40  K  1  Association of Health  Proposed Amendment \nPlans \nMark Krueger / Office of \nS.B. 40  L  1  Proposed Amendment \nthe Attorney General \nS.B. 40  M  1  Chris Neal / Carfax  Proposed Amendment \n ", "\nMINUTES OF THE  \nSENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n \nEighty-first Session \nMarch 11, 2021 \n \n \nThe Senate Committee on Health and Human Services was called to order by \nChair Julia Ratti at 3:31 p.m. on Thursday, March 11, 2021, Online.

(BDR 39-870) \n \nSENATOR JAMES OHRENSCHALL (Senatorial District No. 21): \nI will read from my written statement (Exhibit B). \n \nAMY HONONDEL (Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada): \nI have submitted a written statement (Exhibit C) in support of S.B. 146 and will \noutline the bill and its proposed amendment (Exhibit D) prior to reading from my \nstatement. \n \nSection 1, subsection 1 of the amendment, Exhibit D, requires the admitting \nstaff at a locked mental health facility reach out to a foster child’s main treating \nmental health provider after asking the person bringing the child to the facility if \nthey have a treating psychiatrist or main treating provider. It requires the staff \nto make reasonable efforts to reach that person.  \n \nIf  he  or  she  is  able  to  reach  that  person,  section  1,  subsection  2  of  the \namendment  requires  the  admitting  staff  of  the  hospital  to  make  reasonable \nefforts to coordinate care with the main treatment provider who sees the child \non a regular nonemergent basis. They would also be required to consider input \nfrom  that  treatment  provider  in  determining  the  level  of  care  the  child  will \nreceive while admitted to that locked inpatient facility. \n \nSection 1, subsection 3 of the amendment requires the staff at the admitting \nfacility to get consent from the legal custodian of the child and talk to the child \nobtaining their assent or agreement to coordinate care while in the hospital with \nthe child’s team of mental healthcare providers on the outside. \n \nWhat has become apparent to me from a qualitative observational standpoint \nand my education on child welfare and practice, is youth in foster care have a \nsignificantly higher rate of diagnoses of mental healthcare problems than our \ngeneral population. An article I read recently states 80 percent of the foster care \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \npopulation has mental healthcare issues needing treatment, versus 18 percent \nto 22 percent of the general population. In coordinating care, unlike a child who \nmay  be  in  a  one-or  two-parent  household,  what  makes  it  difficult  for  our \npopulation is that our population is transient. Transient means moving foster \nchildren between placement as we attempt to get them to their forever home or \nwith family, or caseworkers who are advocating or representing these children \nthrough the various child welfare agencies. There is also diffusion of authority in \nthat we have multiple providers, a child welfare worker, attorneys and the court \noverseeing  what  happens  to  these  children.  This  makes  care  coordination \nparticularly difficult.  \n \nThis bill is not intended to undercut what is being done by the mental health \nproviders we have. Rather it is to get them to start coordinating care. When the \ncare is better coordinated, the outcomes are better for our foster youth. Many \nof us will agree we need to improve the outcomes for these children as they are \nat a significant disadvantage. \n \nWe  want  to  make  a  foundation,  or  dialog,  between  the  mental  healthcare \nproviders who deal with our foster youth who do not have a parent to fight for \nthem. They have a caseworker who may sometimes be an on-call worker or \nfoster parent who does not know them. We want the medical professionals to \nstart  communicating  to  get  better  outcomes  for  these  youth  in  the  least \ndestructive setting.  \n \nBAILEY BORTOLIN (Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers): \nOur conversations have led to what looks like a scary amendment; however, it \ncontains language everyone agrees fixes a problem and codifies a best practice \nthat could make a difference for our foster youth. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs this bill intended to be for inpatient admitting only? \n \nMS. HONODEL: \nYes. This is to be used for inpatient admission to a locked facility only. While I \ndo not see the wording for emergency or unplanned, I would submit to the \nCommittee that would be the only time it would be used, when we do have \nplanned admissions. We have a separate procedure in Nevada Revised Statues \n(NRS)  432B,  Court-Ordered  Admission  of  Certain  Children  with  Emotional \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nDisturbance  to  Certain  Facilities,  to  make  a  request  to  the  court  for  court \nordered admissions. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs  this  narrowly  tailored  to  an  emergency  or  unplanned  admittance  to  an \ninpatient facility? \n \nMS. HONODEL: \nCorrect. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIt  appears  there  is  narrowing  language  in  section  1,  subsection  1  of  the \nproposed  amendment, Exhibit D,  that  states  “or  another  healthcare  provider \nauthorized to diagnose and treat mental disorders.” Can we be clear about what \nhealthcare providers we are talking about? \n \nMS. HONODEL: \nFrom the legal advocacy standpoint, this would be someone who is qualified to \ndiagnose a child with either an emotional disturbance or mental health disorder. \nWe are looking at psychiatrists and psychologists, to the extent that certain \nlevel therapists, depending on their training, can make or suggest a diagnosis. \nWe would include them, but this would not be the social work interns working \nunder supervision. We are looking for someone who has a rapport with the \nchild, who is familiar with the child’s treatment and has the requisite education \nand licensure to do diagnose and treat. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nPerhaps an Advanced Practice Registered Nurse (APRN) with an emphasis in \nbehavioral health? \n \nMS. HONODEL: \nCorrect. I have a client that does see an APRN supervised by child psychiatrists \nto diagnose and write prescriptions.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe want to ensure this is drafted correctly to be inclusive of those that would \nmake sense. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nLEON RAVIN, M.D. (Psychiatric Medical Director, Division of Public and Behavioral \nHealth, Department of Health and Human Services): \nThe scope of the individuals who could provide input to the inpatient treatment \nteam  should  include  all  professions  primarily  responsible  for  diagnosis  and \ntreatment of the child in an outpatient setting. Most commonly it would be a \npsychiatrist. We also have to recognize a number of children receiving care from \nproviders such as an APRN since they receive legal rights to practice as licensed \nindependent  providers  without  supervisional  collaboration.  It  is  my \nunderstanding, with the permission of the Nevada State Board of Nursing, they \ncan practice within the scope of psychiatric mental health when they have the \nappropriate credentials and qualifications.  \n \nIn  addition,  there  could  be  a  physician  assistant  who  practices  under  the \nsupervision of a psychiatrist or primary care provider. We need to recognize \nmany  individuals  receive  help  for  their  psychiatric  needs  from  primary  care \nfamily physicians so they could be included.  \n \nIn  cases  when  a  child  is  not  in  need  of  psychotropic  medications,  it  is \nforeseeable a psychologist would be the primary healthcare provider for a child \nfor his or her mental health needs. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI heard psychiatrists, APRNs, physician assistants, primary care physicians and \npsychologists. What about licensed clinical social workers or licensed family \ntherapists? \n \nDR. RAVIN: \nI cannot speak on behalf of the licensed clinical counselors. This should be \nprofessionals who are typically authorized to have medium privileges to inpatient \npsychiatric services. These would usually be physicians, physician assistants or \nAPRNs. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe will need to ensure the amendment, Exhibit D, includes only those with \nadmitting privileges or any behavioral healthcare professional already connected \nwith  a  child  who  may  have  input.  Our  challenge  is  that  another  healthcare \nprovider authorized to diagnose and treat could be a psychologist or a licensed \nmarriage and family therapist social worker.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nDR. RAVIN: \nIt may make sense to split the professionals into two categories. Section 1, \nsubsection  2  of  the  proposed  amendment,  Exhibit  D,  primarily  focuses  on \ndetermining the level of care for the child, determining whether or not to admit \nthe child to the most restrictive settings of an inpatient treatment facility or to \ncontinue treating the child in outpatient settings. This is where you may need a \nprofessional who is at the level of qualifying for ten-minute meeting privileges at \nthe  hospital.  For  ongoing  coordination  of  care  and  discharge  planning,  any \nmental health professional primarily involved in treating a child for mental or \nbehavioral health should be included. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThis makes sense when continuity of care is the goal wherever they are already \nconnected to care.  \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nWhy  are  we  limiting  this  to  juveniles  who  are  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the \njuvenile court? These are the children that legal aid often interacts with. Are we \nseeing this gap with other children as well? \n \nMS. BORTOLIN: \nWhen we started having conversations with treating doctors working within the \nNRS 432B context, we identified that children who already have a diagnosis and \nmedications  are  being  treated  and  end  up  with  a  different  diagnosis  and \nprescribed medications. We were asked to coordinate that care and told this \nwas a best practice and should be happening.  \n \nWe thought the gap was specific to NRS 432B, so we wanted to solve the \nproblem for our clients. I cannot with any first-hand knowledge speak to what is \nhappening elsewhere, but will say that we have gotten feedback that it may \nmake sense to broaden this. \n \nDR. RAVIN: \nI agree the same level of cooperation constitutes good clinical practice across all \nages.  Overall  as  a  practicing  physician,  we  should  not  be  making  the \ndetermination on the scope of care provided, or the level of coordination based \non whether or not the child has parents and is in foster care or any other \nfacility. Even if the person is an adult, we should still strive to maintain the best \ncooperation between inpatient and outpatient providers. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nSENATOR OHRENSCHALL: \nIn my experience practicing in the delinquency courts, not in the abuse and \nneglect sphere, I have heard from parents who have felt frustrated when a child \nwas committed to a State correctional facility having previously had a treating \npsychiatrist. They felt there was a disconnect between the care plan prior to the \nchild  being  committed  to  a  correctional  facility  rather  than  a  mental  health \nfacility. \n \nThis is anecdotal. I do not have studies as to whether this is an issue, but have \nobserved this in terms of continuity of care and whether there is a disconnect in \nthe treatment plan at the facility. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nI  have  a  question  on  the  language  in  section  1,  subsection  1,  versus  the \nlanguage  in  subsection  3  of  the  proposed  amendment, Exhibit  D.  In \nsubsection 1,  we  refer  “to  a  treatment  facility  or  other  division  facility  for \ninpatient  psychiatric  care.”  This  seems  a  bit  broader  than  the  language  in \nsubsection 3 which is “an inpatient psychiatric treatment facility.” \n \nAre these two sections congruent, or is there a reason one is broader than the \nother? \n \nMS. BORTOLIN: \nThis got lost in translation due to the many meetings with stakeholders and has \nbeen recognized by your Committee staff. Clark County Department of Child \nand  Family  Services  requested  subsection  3  narrowing  to  an  inpatient \npsychiatric  treatment  facility,  and  we  will  now  go  back  to  mirror  that  in \nsubsection 1. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe intent of the bill is to apply only to inpatient psychiatric treatment facilities. \nIs that correct? \n \nMS. BORTOLIN: \nYes. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWould this be DCFS facilities only, or would this include private facilities as \nNRS 432B is specific to DCFS as opposed to private facilities? \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nMS. HONODEL: \nThis  bill  is  intended  to  apply  to  both,  which  may  be  the  reason  for  the \nconflicting language. Our youth in Clark County are admitted to both State and \nprivate facilities on an inpatient basis. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nIn section 1, subsection 1 there is a change from “before” to “when”. Why was \nthis change made, and what does “when” mean? \n \nMS. BORTOLIN: \nSome of the concerns were from a practical standpoint. Legally, we agree with \nyou. Practically speaking, we thought “before” made more of a connotation of \n“we cannot do this unless.” We wanted to make it abundantly clear this was a \n“when practicable,” but should not be seen as a basis for denial.  \n \nBRIGID  DUFFY:  (Director,  Juvenile  Division,  Clark  County  District  Attorney’s \nOffice): \nThe  DCFS  requested  to  change  the  “before”  to  “when”,  specifically  what \nMs. Bortolin had expressed. When children are continually cycling into acute \nepisodes  for  emergency  treatment,  we  have  limited  providers  for  our \nyounger-aged children. We wanted to ensure we were not closing opportunities \nfor  our  children  based  on  facilities  stating  they  could  not  reach  a  treating \nhealthcare provider and were unable to admit the child for emergency treatment. \nWe were afraid of how that might be interpreted at 3:00 a.m. by the staff of a \nhospital, believing it would be clearer for everyone to understand, that when \nadmitting a child, you need to make the reasonable effort to contact the treating \nprovider. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nIs there is a reasonable time limit, perhaps within 48 hours? Stating “make \nreasonable effort” alone seems it would address your concern without making \nthe language change. Would it be possible to put an actual requirement that this \nreasonable  effort  be  made  within  a  certain  amount  of  time  as  opposed  to \nleaving it open? \n \nMs. DUFFY: \nReasonable effort was the recommended language of the DCFS. I agree there \nshould  be  some  sort  of  “no  later  than,”  but  again,  we  are  all  working  to \ncompromise and provide the best bill possible.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nDR. RAVIN: \nFrom a medical perspective, it would help to not have a specific deadline on \nhow long the treatment team should make a reasonable effort or at what point \nthey should continue. The considerations are that if a child is brought to a \nfacility on Friday night, the outpatient provider may not be available for his or \nher input until Monday morning. If we say the inpatient treatment team should \nseek that input no later than 12 to 24 hours from the time of admission, we are \nrisking the possibility they will try to seek the input only for the duration of time \noutlined in the language of the bill. After that, they will add an entry in the chart \nstating they attempted to make contact with no response and that would be the \nend of the effort.  \n \nFrom the clinical care perspective, it would make sense for the treatment team \nto continue seeking input and coordination of care for the duration of treatment. \nFor whatever reason they were not successful in making contact during the \nearly hours or days of treatment, they will continue to attempt contact for the \nduration of the treatment episode. \n \nDASHUN JACKSON (Children’s Advocacy Alliance): \nThe  Children’s  Advocacy  Alliance  supports  S.B. 146.  This  bill  promotes  the \nmental  and  emotional  health  of  a  child  and  recognizes  the  trauma  a  child \nexperiences when removed from their home and placed in a facility. This bill \nallows continuity of care while preventing a child from being overmedicated and \nreducing the trauma to the child. This will also allow and promote youth having \na voice. \n \nKENDRA BERTSCHY (Deputy Public Defender, Public Defender's Office, Washoe \nCounty): \nThe Washoe County Public Defender’s Office supports S.B. 146. We appreciate \nthis  bill  being  brought  forward  to  ensure  continuity  of  care  for  children.  I \npreviously worked as a children’s attorney and handled the dockets specifically \nfor child commitment hearings. I would agree with the statement that this can \nbe traumatic, and we are potentially preventing future harm to these children by \nallowing for continuity of care. \n \nJIMMY LAU (Dignity Health – St. Rose Dominican): \nContinuity and coordination of care is an important component to the overall \nimprovement  of  health  outcomes,  especially  to  the  most  vulnerable  in  our \ncommunity.  We  thank  Senator  Ohrenschall  for  bringing  this  legislation  and \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nsupport his effort to enhance continuity and coordination of care for at-risk \nchildren.  \n \nMS. DUFFY: \nThe Clark County DCFS supports S.B. 146 and the policy of ensuring we are \ncoordinating mental health care for our children in foster care. Our children often \ncome with complex levels of trauma and are in need of consistent treatment. \nWhen  a  child  has  an  acute  episode  and  needs  emergency  placement  in  a \npsychiatric  treatment  facility,  it  is  best  practice  and  in  our  children’s  best \ninterest that providers on the outside or the ongoing healthcare providers with \nan established relationship with our children and the acute inpatient psychiatric \ncare provider are communicating.  \n \nOur  children  are  suffering  on  many  levels  throughout  this  pandemic. \nTwenty-three of Clark County School District children have committed suicide \nthis past year. This is a crisis that is impacting not only foster children but all \nchildren across Nevada.  \n \nSENATOR OHRENSCHALL: \nI have heard the Committee’s suggestions in terms of additional detail to the \ndefinition of healthcare provider and the idea of expanding to other children.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 146 and open the hearing on S.B. 158. \n \nSENATE BILL 158: Revises requirements to receive assistance from the Kinship \nGuardianship Assistance Program. (BDR 38-504) \n \nSENATOR JAMES OHRENSCHALL (Senatorial District No. 21): \nI have a submitted written statement (Exhibit E) outlining S.B. 158. \n \nPATRICK HIRSCH (Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada): \nI will read from my written testimony (Exhibit F). \n \nMR. JACKSON: \nThe Children’s Advocacy Alliance supports S.B. 158. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nMS. BORTOLIN: \nThis is a  short and simple bill. The language in  the amendment  (Exhibit G) \nmirrors the federal requirements to use federal funding. This does not change \nanything  about  the  way  the  program  should  work.  We  all  agree  that \nguardianship  is  in  the  best  interest  of  a  child  and  the  most  appropriate \nplacement.  In  some  cases,  we  have  issues  getting  funding  around  a  legal \nimpossibility question—in ten years would it be legally impossible that someone \nmight prefer to adopt a child and do what is in the child’s best interest today? \nWe are working through that statute.  \n \nMS. DUFFY: \nI would like to thank everyone involved in bringing forth S.B. 158 and working \nwith the child welfare agencies to come to an agreement on the amendment \nthat aligns us with federal language and will not impact our federal funding. I \nwas  assured  that  Clark  County  can  remove  its  fiscal  note  if  the  proposed \namendment,  Exhibit  G,  is  accepted,  which  changes  the  original  restrictive \nlanguage drafted and will move us to federally approved language opening up \nKinGAP guardianship for more children and families. \n \nALISON CALIENDO, PH.D. (Executive Director, Foster Kinship): \nI have submitted written testimony (Exhibit H) in support of S.B. 158. \n \nMS. BERTSCHY: \nThe Washoe County Public Defender’s Office supports S.B. 158. The Kinship \nCare Program is an important piece of the process, and we appreciate the work \nto expand this program to help more families. These families are those already \ntaking in their relatives to provide them with a better future. The more we can \ndo to help them and those children the better Nevada will be. \n \nKATHRYN ROOSE (Deputy Administrator, Quality and Oversight, Division of Child \nand Family Services, Department of Health and Human Services): \nThe Division of Child and Family Services is in the neutral position to S.B. 158. \nThe Division submitted a fiscal note based on the original version of the bill and \nwill remove it with the amended language. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 158. \n   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAs there is no public comment, this meeting is adjourned at 4:34 p.m. \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nVickie Polzien, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 11, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nBegins \nExhibit \nBill   on  Witness / Entity  Description \nLetter \nPage \n  A  1    Agenda \nSenator James \nS.B. 146  B  1  Written Statement \nOhrenschall  \nAmy Honodel / Legal \nS.B. 146  C  1  Aid Center of Southern  Support Statement \nNevada \nAmy Honodel / Legal \nS.B. 146  D  1  Aid Center of Southern  Proposed Amendment \nNevada \nSenator James \nS.B. 158  E  1  Written Statement \nOhrenschall \nPatrick Hirsch / Legal \nS.B. 158  F  1  Aid Center of Southern  Support Statement \nNevada \nSenator James \nS.B. 158  G  1  Proposed Amendment \nOhrenschall \nAlison Caliendo / Foster \nS.B. 158  H  1  Support Statement \nKinship \n ", "\nMINUTES OF THE  \nSENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n \nEighty-first Session \nMarch 18, 2021 \n \n \nThe Senate Committee on Health and Human Services was called to order by \nChair Julia Ratti at 3:38 p.m. on Thursday, March 18, 2021, Online.

(BDR 56-135) \n \nSENATOR ROBERTA LANGE (Senatorial District No. 7): \nI am introducing S.B. 168 which deals with two items, cannabis curbside pickup \nand cannabis packaging and labeling, which I will discuss in the presentation \n(Exhibit B). I am joined today by Layke Martin, Executive Director of the Nevada \nDispensary Association. We are presenting this bill and amendment together \n(Exhibit C) in cooperation with the Cannabis Compliance Board (CCB). \n \nLAYKE MARTIN (Executive Director, Nevada Dispensary Association): \nI will read from my written testimony (Exhibit D) regarding cannabis curbside \npickup,  cannabis  packaging  and  labeling,  and  the  proposed  amendment \nExhibit C. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIs there any advertising or signage that comes with this curbside pickup? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nMS. MARTIN: \nI will defer to the CCB for their guidance related to what is required for curbside \npickup. \n \nTYLER KLIMAS (Executive Director, Nevada Cannabis Compliance Board): \nI will ask Kara Cronkhite, who heads audit inspections in my agency, to talk \nabout some of the restrictions for curbside that exist. \n \nKARA CRONKHITE (Health Program Manager, Nevada Cannabis Compliance Board): \nWe have restrictions in place through policy that we would incorporate into \nregulation  regarding  curbside  pickup.  Identifications  of  every  person  in  the \nvehicle are checked. The employees check the order and have to wear masks \nand gloves when handling any product or orders. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIs there a limit on advertising or signage involved with the curbside pickup? Are \nwe keeping within the bounds already existing for advertising and signage of the \ndispensaries? \n \nMS. CRONKHITE: \nYes, we are keeping with the current requirements for advertising and signage. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe insertion of the amended language regarding the labeling of products for \nsale and the removal of language as it relates to production, is this just to \nrecognize  how  product  flows  through  the  production,  manufacturing  and \ndistribution chain so labeling is focused on the consumer rather than every step \nin the process? \n \nMS. MARTIN: \nYou are exactly right. It is to allow flexibility for CCB to determine how the \nwording should be best conveyed versus having specific stops where everybody \nhas to apply their own labels. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nI refer to the amendment, top of page 8, where you are striking \"a written \nnotification with each sale of ... \" and replacing it with \"A cannabis sales facility \nshall convey the following information to consumers ... .\" Is there anything that \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nsays it can just be verbal? Can you just have a sign posted on the wall behind \nthe register?  Does there have to be an actual delivery of content? \n \nMS. MARTIN: \nThe intention is to make sure the information is presented in the best way \npossible  to  the  consumer.  There  is  not  an  intent  it  would  be  on  a  sign  or \nverbally conveyed. We are looking at a printout at the point of sale versus a \nsheet that is slipped into the exit bag versus a label on the product itself. We \npropose leaving it to the CCB to handle in regulation to determine what the best \nmanner is to convey the information. I do not think the CCB has any intention of \nallowing those warnings to be given verbally. \n \nMATTHEW WALKER (Nevada Dispensary Association): \nI would point you to the presentation, Exhibit B, on both those questions and \nthe manner in which something is prescribed to be on the label versus on the \nsticker attached to it. You can see on the smaller products what results is less \ninformation being meaningfully conveyed to the consumer. We are hoping to \nclear  the  statutory  path  so  the  CCB  can  comprehensively  take  up  these \nregulations and ensure the information is made available, is absorbed by the \nconsumer and can be compared among products. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe intent is it would not be up to the dispensary to decide how to convey the \ninformation, but rather we are taking it out of statute and putting it into the \nregulatory framework. So your body would still perform the regulatory process, \nwould give detailed instructions and would be more flexible to change because \nit is in the regulatory framework instead of the statutory framework. Is this the \nidea? \n \nMR. KLIMAS: \nYes. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWould you say for the record you do not intend to loosen the labeling or the \nstandards in terms of the information the consumers need to stay safe? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nMR. KLIMAS: \nAbsolutely. Core principles, public health and safety will be at the top of my list \nwhenever we promulgate any regulations around what is conveyed as far as \ninformation. \n \nDARRELL LACY (Planet 13 Holdings, Inc.): \nWe support S.B. 168 and offer a support statement (Exhibit E).  \n \nSENATOR LANGE: \nThis is not something new. It was already happening in curbside pickup and was \nsuccessful for the business owners and patrons. The bill puts this into law. The \nlabeling ensures these products are safe and people know what is in them when \nthey take the products home. Products that look like candy are marked so they \ndo not look like candy and can be kept out of the reach of children. Those kinds \nof things are important components in the industry.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will now close the hearing on S.B. 168. I will open the work session on \nS.B. 49. \n \nSENATE BILL 49: Revises provisions relating to cannabis. (BDR 56-268) \n \nMEGAN COMLOSSY (Policy Analyst): \nI will read the summary of S.B. 49 and amendments from the work session \ndocument (Exhibit F). \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe had testimony on this bill, hearing from individuals who were concerned \nabout  the  ability  to  do  background  checks  in  publicly  traded  companies.  \nStakeholders who were interested on that issue met with the CCB to see if they \ncould mutually agree. We did not come to a 100 percent agreement, but CCB \nbelieves  many  of  the  stakeholders'  concerns  could  be  addressed  through  a \nregulatory process.  \n \nMR. KLIMAS: \nThat  is  correct.  We  do  have  a  number  of  publicly  traded  companies  in  the \nindustry. Nevada Cannabis Compliance Regulation 5 (NCCR 5), is a regulation \ndealing  with  publicly  traded  companies,  background  checks  and  waivers. \nWaivers of ownership under 5 percent allow for publicly traded companies with \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nseveral  shareholders  to  continue  to  make  day  trades  and  purchase  and  sell \nshares. Waivers of ownership under 5 percent do not have to go through a \ncomplete registration process that any owner over 5 percent has to go through. \nThere has been input from publicly traded companies about the 5 percent and \n10  percent  thresholds.  There  are  suggestions  on  how  to  streamline  that \nprocess, and the CCB understands those concerns. At the last Board meeting, it \nis on record CCB will hold workshops, both informal and formal whenever we \nmake regulatory changes, so there will be plenty of opportunity to talk through \nNCCR  5.  We  encourage  input  from  all  our  publicly  traded  companies, \nstakeholders and the public. We look forward to continuing to refine NCCR 5 \nand all our regulations as they are living documents. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWould you acknowledge there could be better processes when it comes to \npublicly  traded  companies,  and  that  is  your  intent  by  opening  up  those \nworkshops on this part of your regulations? \n \nMR. KLIMAS: \nCorrect.  With  publicly  traded  companies  and  different  ownership  structures, \nthere  are  many  scenarios  and  situations  that  go  along  with  ownership  and \ntransfer of ownership, stock shares and selling stocks. We certainly anticipate \ngetting into NCCR 5 and making changes that account for all those situations \nthat arise and to help streamline the process for both regulators and members of \nthe industry. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe third amendment of the first paragraph states \"The Board may employ the \nservices of such persons it considers necessary for the purposes of hearing \ndisciplinary proceedings.\" Is it subject to the Open-Meeting Law? Do we know \nthe qualifications of those people who are employed to help or preclusions of \nwho is not?  \n \nMR. KLIMAS: \nIt allows us to hire an administrative law judge. This is similar to other State \nagencies. The CCB does not have its own administrative law judge. We have \nbeen borrowing the Department of Taxation's administrative law judge. This is \nwhat this amendment allows us to do and is the only service we would employ \nunder this subsection. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThis would not include an increase of fees for the people who are paying for the \ndisciplinary proceeding? \n \nMR. KLIMAS: \nThe administrative law judge is in the Governor's approved budget. The funds \nare in there. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will entertain a motion on S.B. 49. \n \n  SENATOR HARDY MOVED TO AMEND AND DO PASS AS AMENDED \nS.B. 49. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nDuring the hearing, I expressed a concern about the 45-day extension and its \nability to be done in perpetuity. I notice the bill still says may approve one or \nmore extensions. I encourage you through the regulatory process to put some \nconstraints around the 45-day extension so it cannot continually be pushed out. \nThere  need  to  be  clear  instructions  on  when  the  45-day  extension  will  be \ngranted or limits on how many times it can be done. At this time, I will vote the \nbill out of Committee but will reserve my right to change my vote on the Senate \nFloor. \n \n  THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will open the work session on S.B. 156. \n \nSENATE  BILL  156:  Revises  provisions  relating  to  crisis  stabilization  centers. \n(BDR 40-488) \n \nMS. COMLOSSY: \nI will read the summary of S.B. 156 and the amendments from the work session \ndocument (Exhibit G). \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe intent of this bill is to expand crisis stabilization centers from psychiatric \nhospitals to all hospitals, and we needed to work on the details of the wording \nto ensure we were getting to all hospitals. We have representatives of both \namendments if you have any clarifying questions. \n \nSENATOR HARDY MOVED TO AMEND AND DO PASS AS AMENDED \nS.B. 156. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER SECONDED THE MOTION. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIf we adopt amendment 2 as submitted by Mary Walker, Carson Tahoe Health, \ndo we still need to adopt amendment 1 as submitted by Joan Hall, Nevada Rural \nHospital Partners, since the intent of amendment 2 is to capture amendment 1? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nOur understanding from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) \nis we need to do both to capture all of the different types of hospitals. \n \nTHE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \n \n* * * * * \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will open the hearing on S.B. 175. \n \nSENATE BILL 175: Enacts provisions relating to lupus. (BDR 40-8) \n \nSENATOR DINA NEAL (Senatorial District No. 4): \nI am presenting S.B. 175, which is a bill about lupus. I want to show a quick \nvideo  about  what  lupus  is  and  share  written  presentations  (Exhibit  H)  and \n(Exhibit I) about lupus.  This bill would start tracking variants associated with \nlupus and get data on what is happening outside of the hospitalizations that are \noccurring for lupus patients. \n \nI have also submitted an amendment to S.B. 175 (Exhibit J). The most recent \nevent  around  lupus  funding  was  in  2020  when  Congress  authorized \n$8.5 million. Those funds went to the National Lupus Patient Registry indicating \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nthere was a clear interest to recognize the importance of what is going on with \nlupus. \n \nCALVINIA WILLIAMS (Founder and President, Lupus of Nevada): \nI support S.B. 175. The mission of Lupus of Nevada is educational awareness \nand advocacy. For the last 17 years, our program has consisted of nutritional \nworkshops, support group meetings, coping strategies, educational conferences, \ncommunity outreach and resources to assist our lupus community. \n \nIndividuals diagnosed with lupus face many obstacles. Some of our families and \nfriends  choose  to  blame  us  for  pretending  to  have  lupus  or  its  symptoms. \nUnfortunately, they are not aware of the impact of this devastating disease so \nthey choose to look the other way. I am a lupus survivor of 20 years. My \nmedications are 28 pills each day just to survive. \n \nYears ago, I was taken to the hospital as a possible stroke patient with lupus \nand other life-threatening problems associated with lupus. The head emergency \nroom (ER) doctor prevented the other physicians from injecting something into \nme for a stroke. The ER doctor explained lupus is the great imitator, and he did \nnot allow the injection. Instead, the ER doctor ordered other tests for me; I had \nbeen misdiagnosed. The ER doctor saved my life. How many more lupus lives \nhave been misdiagnosed and did not make it? For those reasons, please pass \nS.B. 175. \n \nCHAPLAIN WANDA BAILEY JOHNSON (Director, Outreach for Lupus, Nevada): \nI support S.B. 175. I was diagnosed with pseudomonas aeruginosa, a type of \nbacteria. This illness came from unclean tools or equipment in the hospital. I \nwas supposed to get a neural stimulator for my back to stimulate the pain; after \nchanging my bandage daily, it took three months to finally clear it up and get \nbetter. We need S.B. 175 so we will not be used as guinea pigs. We need \nphysicians  to  be  accountable  for  what  they  do,  what  they  give  to  lupus \npatients, and not just tell us it is a lupus flare up. \n \nOne year ago, when I was in the hospital, the doctors gave me 1,000 milligrams \nof prednisone for 4 days. They dropped it to 80 milligrams and sent me home. \nMy primary doctor told me it could have killed me. You are not supposed to \ndrop from a high dosage to a low dosage in an instant. You have to be weaned \noff and come down slowly off prednisone. It took my doctor weeks to get me \nback to the right dosage in order to treat my lupus. This bill would make the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \ndoctors accountable for giving lupus patients the right medication. Please pass \nthis bill. \n \nSHAEANN CLEMENTS-OJEDA: \nI  support  S.B.  175.  I  am  an  executive  board  member  of  the  Nevada  State \nDemocratic Party. I was diagnosed with lupus when I was nine years old and \nam on dialysis while waiting to get on a transplant list. We need more research, \ninformation and statistics to find better treatments and more resources. We also \nneed to hold our doctors accountable. Being diagnosed so young was a lucky \nthing for me. The pediatric staff was more attentive than the adult medical \nworld and, because of that, I knew who were the good doctors and nurses. \nWhen I became an adult, I came into the hospital with chest pains, severe \nheartburn, high heart rate and a sore left arm. I sat in the ER for two hours \nwithout any of my vitals taken or EKG with these symptoms. I kept asking the \nnurse when was someone going to take my vitals and EKG, and she would tell \nme \"soon.\" Finally, after sitting there for a few more hours, I demanded to \nknow why I had not had my vitals or EKG taken. I had all the symptoms of a \nheart attack and my family had a history of heart disease. \n \nA nurse sat down next to me and started rubbing my left arm that I had been \nholding.  I  told  her  I  was  in  severe  pain.  She  started  to  explain  how  the \ndemographics worked. Patients who were older and more predisposed to deadly \nissues would go first. Age and other things were factors for my long wait. I \nexplained I fully understood the demographics and any patient of any age with \nchest pain and head injuries takes precedent after fatal bleeding wounds. I went \non to say if she continued to say otherwise she would be facing violations for \nthis hospital. Almost immediately after saying this, I did finally get my vitals and \nEKG taken. I eventually found out it was pericarditis, inflammation of my heart's \nlining, a common symptom of lupus. It truly hurt like I was having a heart \nattack. \n \nLastly, you need to know about the severity of lupus and how it is different for \nevery patient. You could be like my friend who has painful but less deadly \nsymptoms. You could have the severity of these two women speaking here with \nme today. You have me, a 27-year-old on dialysis who almost died 3 different \ntimes. You also have my mother. She was not only diagnosed as a paranoid \nschizophrenic and had lupus serositis her whole life, she also died not long ago \nas she was being diagnosed while on a dialysis machine. She died from heart \nfailure. If not for a doctor in the psychiatric hospital she was in, who recognized \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nme, none of us would have known she had lupus, nor would we have known \nwhat could have been causing my mother's psychosis her whole life. \n \nShe was never able to raise her children as she desperately wanted to do since \nbefore  I  was  born  as  the  first  child.  Perhaps,  if  we  had  more  information \nregarding  lupus  patients  in  states  like  Nevada,  maybe  doctors  would  have \ncaught it sooner. Maybe I would have had a mother, instead of vague memories \nof her being unstable and dangerous and scared of the world her whole life due \nto living in a false reality; which was only a symptom. Her case should be \nrecorded and looked into and so should mine as every other lupus patient living \nin this State. \n \nSENATOR NEAL: \nThe three presenters we just heard offer different stories about how they have \nbeen affected by lupus. Section 5, subsection 2, paragraph (a) of S.B. 175 \nestablishes  a  system  where  we  can  conduct  comprehensive  epidemiology \nsurveys of lupus and its variants and evaluate the appropriateness and measures \nfor treatment. We need to understand what is happening because this disease \nmimics  other  diseases.  We  need  to  have  enough  data  and  education  for \nphysicians so they do not continue to misdiagnose lupus patients. \n \nSection 6 of the bill continues to prescribe the kind of information we need to \nseek within this framework, such as the variant for cases of lupus, the method \nof  treatment  without  limitation,  the  kind  of  drugs,  any  other  diseases  from \nwhich the patient suffers, and information containing the usage and access to \nhealthcare services. If a patient is diagnosed with lupus and dies, we need to \nknow what happened and how the patient died. \n \nWhen  we  listen  to  Ms.  Clements-Ojeda's  testimony,  if  her  mother  was \ndiagnosed, knowing there was a cognitive variant to lupus that would have \nhelped her get treatment earlier. What happened with the misdiagnosis of a \nstroke, when Ms. Williams truly had symptoms of lupus, is something that may \nhave happened to thousands of women. We do not know because there could \nhave been a doctor who said a patient was having a stroke, gave the patient \nmedication for a stroke and then effectively killed the patient. \n \nI felt this bill was important when these presenters approached me about this \nlegislation. The bill mimics A.B. No. 254 of the 80th Session, a bill I brought \nabout sickle cell disease. Nevada used to be part of the registry and collected \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \ndata. We fall in line with the national recommendations from 2015 from DHHS. \nThis bill is within the general guidelines of what is being expected as the first \nstep; to start collecting the data around patients; have the data housed and \nreported.  This  will  help  us  understand  what  is  going  on  with  these  lupus \npatients. The rest of the bill explains the analysis and confidentiality provisions \nof the reports that will be collected. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIs there a fiscal note attached to the bill? We had issues with the Nevada \nCentral Cancer Registry when we were trying to assess fees on the providers to \nreport data back to the Cancer Registry. It became a significant financial burden \non small doctor's offices and impeded the collection of data for the patients. In \nsections 7 and 8 of the bill, along the diagnosis and treatment spectrum, which \npeople are going to be assessed fees for collection of the data and who will be \nrequired to collect the data? \n \nSENATOR NEAL: \nThe majority of patients see rheumatologists in the State. There are about 13 or \n14 rheumatologists who focus on the autoimmune disease portion of lupus. The \nother entities potentially affected are the hospitals and the ERs that are seeing \nthe patient and transmitting the information. If the patient has a primary care \nphysician, then that physician would also be looped in. The provision in the bill \nis similar to a provision I had on a bill on sickle cell, A.B. No. 254 of the \n80th Session, where a fee was assessed. I recall conversations raised in the \nAssembly, but this has been the mechanism to get this information reported—to \nplace the onus on the actual entity treating the individual. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWe have a massive shortage of rheumatologists in this State. The financial onus \nof  the  State's  work  being  placed  on  a  small  number  of  providers  could  be \nproblematic. I do not know the workload of collecting single patient's files from \nmultiple providers, from a hospital to a primary care physician, and then creating \nan abstract for each one of those patients. It seems like a lot of work and I \nworry about what those fees might have to be to cover the cost of this bill. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe have Lindsay Kinsinger here from DHHS. The fiscal note has not dropped \nyet, but the deadline has not passed, and DHHS has worked on it. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nLINDSAY  KINSINGER  (Manager,  Office  of  Public  Health  Informatics  and \nEpidemiology, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, Department of \nHealth and Human Services): \nIt would be the cost of one full-time employee to do the work within our office \nto manage this registry, work on the fee structure, abstract the data, collect the \ndata, put it into our system and develop the reporting. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nDo you have an estimate of what the fee would be for each of the providers to \ngenerate that kind of revenue based on patients seen? \n \nMS. KINSINGER: \nIt would cost DHHS about $112,000 per year for one full-time employee. I do \nnot know how many rheumatologists there are across the State and how it \nwould break down. I am not fully aware of what levels are in each medical \nprovider's  office  the  State  has  collected.  This  employee  would  also  be \nresponsible for developing the fee structure and who would pay what. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nI appreciate the need for collecting and using this information. I worry the fee \nstructure may go against the good we are looking for in the bill. \n \nSENATOR NEAL: \nI understand there are going to be costs associated with this bill. In talking with \nDHHS, we could work out having one full-time employee. We have to take the \nfirst step in passing this bill because individuals are facing serious consequences \nof having an invincible disease. \n \nWhen I look at other states that have passed legislation, they have been few \nand far between. California unsuccessfully attempted to pass two bills twice. \nGeorgia has managed to form a commission on lupus. Illinois is the only state \nthat passed a bill about lupus for individuals. Nevada is one of those states that \n$112,000  will  save  10,000  women's  lives  after  being  misdiagnosed  and \nprovide enough data for us to get involved at the national level and obtain \nfunding. \n \nAs I mentioned earlier, the federal government took $8.5 million, but the total \namount that came out of Congress was $21.5 million; $10 million went to lupus \nresearch, $2 million went to the Office of Minority Health and $9.5 million went \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nto the National Lupus Patient Registry. There is an opportunity, if we pass this \nlegislation, to engage in grants and connect us from State to federal levels so \nwe can access funding. We do not have a framework to even enter the Lupus \nRegistry  nationally  because  we  do  not  have  legislation  that  is  asking  for \nsurveillance  data  around  these  patients.  I  understand  the  costs,  but  I  also \nunderstand if this bill would get a one-shot chance of getting $112,000, we \ncould walk into an environment where we would leverage ourselves for federal \ndollars. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nMy suggestion is if we want to prioritize it, let us find a quarter of a million \ndollars and do it, rather than trying to create this funding mechanism. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe suggestion is to take out the fee structure. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThis is a disease mostly affecting women. \n \nSENATOR NEAL: \nYes, 90 percent of lupus patients happen to be women. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nDo you know what percentage of them are Black, Indigenous and People of \nColor? \n \nSENATOR NEAL: \nIn Nevada, based on the available hospitalization data shown in Exhibit H, Black \nwomen represented 23.9 percent of the hospitalizations; 3.3 percent Hispanic; \n5.7  percent  Native  American/Alaskan  Native  non-Hispanic;  3.3  percent \nAsian/Pacific Islander non-Hispanic; and 4.0 percent White non-Hispanic. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThe last number for 2020 was 300,000 Nevadans that had been impacted by \nCovid-19. I think lupus is comorbidity when you are talking about diseases that \nepidemiologists track. Am I correct? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nSENATOR NEAL: \nI do not know if the epidemiologists are tracking the comorbidity; that is the \ndata I am trying to obtain. I do have data as to the number of deaths. There \nwere approximately 133 lupus-related deaths between 2017 and 2020. That \nwas a rate of 1.1 per 100,000 in Nevada. Approximately 83 percent of the \n133 deaths were female, 44 percent were white non-Hispanic and 23 percent \nwere Black non-Hispanic. The data is based on the ICD-10 codes DHHS was \nable to pull for me in the summer. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI ask this question because if it is one of the comorbidities for Covid-19 such as \nasthma, high blood pressure or diabetes, I would think an autoimmune disease \nwould be qualified as a comorbidity. Having said that, what funding is available \neither at the State or federal level to address this issue? The question is not if, \nbut  when  will  we  have  another  pandemic.  If  we  do  not  shore  up  those \ncommunities  that  are  more  susceptible  to  these  things,  we  will  see  more \ninfections and more deaths. What money is available at the State level, and \nwhat  has  come  in  for  Covid-19  relief  as  it  relates  to  medical  diagnosis  or \nprevention? Certainly lupus is a disease that mimics other diseases and puts \nindividuals at a greater risk of misdiagnosis or is paid for with people's lives. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe Covid-19 pandemic has shone a spotlight on the disproportionate impact on \nparts of our healthcare system for people of color. Asking for funds in this bill is \nmodest to address a specific disease that disproportionately affects women and \npeople of color. \n \nSection 7, subsection 3, states: \n \nThe State Board of Health shall by regulation adopt a schedule of \nfees which must be assessed to a healthcare facility for each case \nfrom which information is abstracted by the Division pursuant to \nsubsection 2. \n \nAre you committed to a fee structure where facilities pay part of the cost to \ncollect this information? If a General Fund appropriation was available, would \nthat suffice? As a sponsor of the bill, do you care how the funds are obtained? \nIs this an issue? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nSENATOR NEAL: \nIt is not an issue. To amend the bill without the fee would be a gamble. Would \nwe find the $112,000 going through the Senate Committee on Finance to fund \nthe mechanism, if the fee was removed? I do not care how it gets funded. If we \ndo this, we position ourselves for federal money that would become available in \nthe  future  to  help  the  research  and  establishment  of  a  system  to  report \ninformation  on  lupus  and  its  variants.  Right  now,  we  have  no  part  of  the \nlandscape of lupus, not our state next door to us, not the states around us. We \nwould be putting a step forward to say, at least in the western side of the \nUnited States, we want to help lupus patients. If you remove the fee structure \nand can find $112,000, I would be open to it. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIt seems like there is another fee in section 8, subsection 2, subparagraph (b), \nfor anyone who wants to perform research with the data. We are a policy \ncommittee, and we are focusing on the merits of the policy. Either way, it will \nbe forwarded to the Senate Committee on Finance for discussion if it comes out \nof our Committee. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI understand that $112,000 would be the cost for one full-time State employee \nwho will manage the registry, abstract and collect the data, and develop the \nreporting  structure.  Sections  5  and  6  of  the  bill  require  hospitals,  medical \nlaboratories and other facilities, and providers of health care to carry the bulk of \nthe financial burden. They will be trying to report the information on a reporting \nform  in  a  prescribed  manner  ensuring  it  is  compatible  with  HIPAA  so  that \nnames, ages and other data are not shared. It is problematic for the State and \nthe industry. There would be questions as to who reported data, who did not \nreport  data  and  when  it  was  done.  Looking  at  section  6,  subsection  2, \nsubparagraph (a), name, address, age and ethnicity of the patient are pretty \nsensitive things we are trying to figure out how to report and deal with. I have \nchallenges with the logistics. I do not feel as comfortable as I would like. How \ndo you do it? \n \nSENATOR NEAL: \nThe  information  on  patients  goes  from  the  care  facility  to  the  Division. \nSection 11 states, \"The Division shall not reveal the identity of any patient, \nphysician or health care facility.\" \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nSection 12, contains the confidentiality provision which states: \n \nA person or governmental entity that provides information to the \nDivision in accordance with sections 5, 6 and 7 of this act must \nnot be held liable in a civil or criminal action for sharing confidential \ninformation unless the person or organization has done so in bad \nfaith or with malicious purpose. \n \nThis language is similar to language in A.B. No. 254 of the 80th Session on \nsickle cell. These provisions in that bill passed the legislative process to make \nsure it is a two-way street between the provider and the Division, which is who \nwants  this  information  or  are  designated  in  this  legislation  to  get  this \ninformation. The language in section 11 is the same language as in the sickle \ncell bill signed by Governor Sisolak. There have been no confidentiality breaches \nwith the same exact language you see in sections 11 and 12. \n \nSAMANTHA WAYNE: \nI support S.B. 175. I have been living with lupus for 14 years. I cannot tell you \nhow many times doctors have been hesitant to treat me. I was forced to turn to \nmy rheumatologist who will not treat me for anything but my lupus. In 2017, I \nhad to go to the hospital for extreme chest pains and trouble breathing. I waited \nhours in a hospital bed before they decided to treat me with ibuprofen. It was \nclear to  me I was just another patient looking  for pain  meds rather than a \n24-year-old in extreme pain. Instead, I went home with temporary pain relief \nand a $700 hospital bill. \n \nIn 2018, I was in the hospital again after developing autoimmune hemolytic \nanemia, which is a rare blood disorder that can occur with lupus. My body was \nattacking my red blood cells, causing me to become dangerously ill. The doctors \nwere fearful of giving me a blood transfusion because the lupus would continue \nto attack the new blood cells; they were unsure how to treat me. I have been \nadvocating for lupus since I was 15. Early on, I saw the gap in treatment and \nawareness. It is important to improve the care of thousands of Nevadans living \nwith lupus every day by using research and data. \n \nTASHE PITTMAN: \nI support S.B. 175. I am a technical sergeant and retired veteran from Nellis Air \nForce  Base.  I  was  diagnosed  with  lupus  in  2015  and  have  been  a  medical \nmystery since 2004. I had symptoms of breaking out from the sun, allergic to \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nsunscreen, rapid heart rate and not knowing if I was having a stroke or heart \nattack. There are no doctors on base, so I was sent downtown. I have been in \nbetween doctors because most of the medical doctors for military people are \nmedical students, so most of the time my appointments are pushed downtown. \n \nThe problem I have noticed is when going to the ER I must have a referral from \na doctor and they have to state it is for lupus. However, they do not know \nexactly what my symptoms are, so most of the time, I get a diagnosis for my \nlupus and am told to see a rheumatologist. The research would be vital for \npeople in the military or people who do not know they have lupus and grow up \nfinding out they had lupus earlier in life. This information would be vital in \npassing this bill. \n \nSENATOR NEAL: \nSection 10 of this  bill would require DHHS to coordinate  with the  National \nLupus Patient Registry and include in the list of purposes for which DHHS must \napply for and accept any gifts, grants and donations. \n \nThe purpose of the amendment is to put DHHS in a position to use leverage to \npursue federal funds since DHHS is not part of the Lupus Registry. If DHHS \nbecomes part of the Registry and legislation is passed to start the surveillance \nprojects going on since 2004, DHHS can be in a position to start applying for \ngrants to help move this agenda forward around lupus patients. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThe  issue  is  about  the  money.  Is  it  possible  to  add,  \"as  money  becomes \navailable\"? Would this put DHHS in a position to pursue grants? \n \nSENATOR NEAL: \nI believe so as long as DHHS, in the back of the bill, was allowed to still go after \ngrants  and  donations.  I  have  seen  that  language  and  it  is  a  good  policy. \nHopefully, the Committee can find the support to get the policy out as a first \nstep forward for it to go to the Senate Committee on Finance to find money or \nprovide funds as they become available. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nPage 5, section 10, of the bill says the \"Division shall apply\". It directs the \nDHHS to apply for and accept any gifts, grants and donations specifically to \nsupport this project. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nI did see where the bill directed DHHS to apply; however, it seems like the issue \nis money. I was trying to figure out a way to make sure the language in the bill \nis strong enough to survive, and then whatever gifts or grants are out there, \nDHHS can still go for them. If we have that opportunity, then money is not an \nissue. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe are a policy committee. We will make a decision based on the merits of the \npolicy.  Since  it  has  financial  implications,  if  the  bill  passes  out  of  our \nCommittee,  it  will  go  to  the  Finance  Committee  and  there  will  be  another \nopportunity for another conversation to talk about the money. We are focused \non policy in this Committee. We will not vote on the bill today. By legislative \nrules, there has to be some separation, typically, between the time you hear the \nbill and the time you vote on the bill.  \n \nI will now close the hearing on S.B. 175. The hearing on S.B. 251 is now open. \n \nSENATE BILL 251: Revises provisions relating to genetic counseling and testing. \n(BDR 40-478) \n \nSENATOR HEIDI SEEVERS GANSERT (Senatorial District No. 15): \nI am joined by Dr. Nathan Slotnick, who is a medical geneticist and high-risk \nobstetrician. He has been practicing and seeing patients in Nevada since 1990. \nIn 2005, he was asked to start a cancer genetics program by a local oncology \npractitioner group. He has also been part of a high-risk pregnancy practice with \nover 50,000 patients. He has been on the faculty at the University of Nevada, \nReno (UNR), School of Medicine and in 2020 was named medical director for \nreproductive  genetic  medicine  at  Invitae  Corporation.  I  am  also  joined  by \nAbbi Whitaker,  who  is  a  well-respected  and  award-winning  communications \nspecialist and entrepreneur. She and her husband founded the Abbi Agency \nwhose  tagline  reads  \"Where  Chutzpah  Meets  Acumen,\"  which  accurately \ndescribes her.  \n \nThis bill is about raising awareness and increasing appropriate screening for the \nmost  common  cause  of  heredity  breast  cancer.  This  would  be  inherited \nduplications of cancer genes also known as breast cancer gene (BRCA) 1 and \nBRCA 2, which Dr. Slotnick will cover. Ms. Whitaker will tell her story. Within \nthe  past  five  years,  I  have  six  friends  who  have  been  diagnosed  as \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nBRCA positive, including Ms. Whitaker. Dr. Slotnick will be able to explain the \nhigh risk of cancer if a person is BRCA positive. \n \nThe common thread with my friends is they have been fighting cancer for a \nwhile and many of them were diagnosed at an early age. The dots were never \nconnected to show they may have had a hereditary mutation. The reason it \nmatters if you have the BRCA genes is because women may have it as well as \ntheir children, because it is hereditary. My friends and a member of my family \nhave been affected by this and some have children who were born positive and \nsome negative. The key we need to remember is you have to be able to get a \nscreening and a referral for counseling and then testing. \n  \nROBERT  NATHAN  SLOTNICK,  M.D.,  PH.D.  (Director,  Medical  Genetics  and \nGenomics): \nI will be talking about an increasingly important component of cancer care; a \nsubset of medical genetics. We are what we are because of what we inherit \nfrom our parents. Genes are made of a chemical called DNA which is included \nwithin the cells of our body. All human adults have in their body approximately \n30 trillion cells. All of those cells are the result of many cell divisions from a \nsingle fertilized egg. Every time a cell divides, errors can occur. When those \nerrors occur, they can accumulate. If those errors accumulate in some of the \ncontrol genes of the cell, one of the possible results is cancer. I have included a \npresentation (Exhibit K) on Genetics and Cancer Technology which discusses in \ndetail information on cancer risks, BRCA 1 and BRCA 2, and genetic testing. In \nsummary, genetic testing identifies patients at risk and their families. There \nshould  be  a  discussion  of  family  history,  and  BRCA  testing  should  be \nencouraged. \n \nABBI WHITAKER: \nI am 45 years old and have tested positive for BRCA 2. I have been getting \nmammograms for the last five years and this year switched to Reno Diagnostic \nCenter. I filled out a questionnaire about my family history. When I went in for \nmy mammogram, I was told I had been flagged to potentially take a free genetic \ntest. A few weeks later, I was contacted by a genetic counselor who wanted to \nspeak with me about the tests. I got busy and did not call her back; however, \nshe kept leaving me messages so I finally called her as I thought it must be \nimportant. They told me I had tested positive for BRCA 2. I did not understand \nwhat this was and I did not know a lot about it. They told me it would increase \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nmy chances in my lifetime from 45 percent to 75 percent that I would develop \nbreast cancer and 45 percent for ovarian cancer. \n \nI am already a cancer survivor. I had anal cancer, with chemo and radiation, and \nnever was I flagged for this type of genetic testing or for BRCA. I go to the \ndoctor all the time for blood work, and you think they would have caught this. \nThankfully, the Reno Diagnostic Center decided to follow their policy and ask \nme those questions because now I know. I have eight brothers and sisters who \nare all now going through genetic testing to find out if they, too, have BRCA 1 \nor  BRCA  2.  I  have  ten  cousins  throughout  the  world  who  are  also  testing \nknowing this came from my father's side. \n \nI decided on April 15 to have a bilateral double mastectomy, followed by a \nhysterectomy. I am able to make this choice because Reno Diagnostic Center \nasked me some simple questions about my genetic history, and I was able to \nfind out I had the BRCA 2 gene. As women, mothers, senators, career women, \nwe  have  so  many  things  going  on  in  our  lives.  The  fact  I  now  have  this \nknowledge, can make a decision and make sure I do not die from this cancer is \nphenomenal. \n \nI approached Senator Seevers Gansert about informing and educating men and \nwomen  and  possibly  changing  the  law  for  more  cancer  screening.  Fighting \ncancer is not something we want to do. If we have the knowledge, we can stop \nit with my daughter and son, your daughter and your son. I think this is a \nwonderful opportunity. \n \nSENATOR SEEVERS GANSERT: \nI have a conceptual amendment (Exhibit L) stating the screening, counseling and \nreferral  for  testing  is  covered  under  preventive  services  based  on  the \nU.S. Preventive Services Task Force meaning the federal government covers \nthese services. Insurance carriers are required to cover the screening, referral for \ncounseling and potentially the testing. Section 1 requires primary care providers \nto screen women to determine if there is a family history indicating an increased \nrisk for a harmful mutation in the BRCA gene, and if the screening indicates an \nincreased risk, to take certain actions to ensure the woman receives genetic \ntesting and genetic counseling if testing positive for the gene. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nSection 2 of S.B. 251 describes the notice received with a mammogram which \nflags  a  person  for  genetic  testing.  Section  3  exempts  practitioners  from  a \ncategory D felony to a misdemeanor for any violation of section 1. \n \nAs was described by Dr. Slotnick, when you test positive for BRCA, the odds of \ngetting cancer are off the charts; as high as 87 percent in your lifetime. We \nneed to raise awareness and increase the screening so people know if they are \nat risk and take appropriate actions. It could be pharmaceuticals or surgery, but \nwhat we want to do is make sure people can stay as healthy as possible. \nMs. Whitaker mentioned her children, siblings and cousins are testing because it \nis a hereditary mutation. We should be testing when there is family history \nbecause it can save lives. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nI am appreciative of the exemption from the felony requirement. Is there any \nkind of stick to this carrot to encourage doctors to comply with the law? \n \nSENATOR SEEVERS GANSERT: \nThe requirement for health care providers to screen women for BRCA gene \nmutations and provide referrals for genetic counseling and testing is brand new. \nWhen you go to a physician, the doctor usually does a family history. It is about \nconnecting the dots. There are tools that have been developed and are being \ndeveloped to make it easy for practitioners to screen for BRCA and provide \nreferrals for genetic counseling and testing. I hope this bill strongly encourages \npractitioners. I have been talking with the medical association and practitioners \nabout trying to get this bill implemented. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nSections  8  through  11  address  continuing  education  credits  for  genetic \ninstruction.  Can these credits replace or be in lieu of suicide, pain management, \naddiction or the other requirements that physicians, whether M.D. or D.O., have \na responsibility for? \n \nSENATOR SEEVERS GANSERT: \nIt  is  not  a  replacement,  it  allows  these  credits  to  count.  There  are  certain \ncategories that are required, but there are more continuing medical education \nrequirements than are categorized. It is a choice an individual can make to get \ncredit for completing a course relating to genetic counseling and testing. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe way the language in the bill reads, it looks like it could replace or be in lieu \nof those other requirements. Is that not your intent? \n \nSENATOR SEEVERS GANSERT: \nThe intent is not to replace; it is to make it an option. There are certain required \ncategories, but genetic instruction would be an acceptable category to fulfil part \nof the entire number of continuing education requirements that are in statute. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nRight now, I do not know of anything that would preclude you from counting \ngenetic hours. \n \nTOM CLARK (Nevada Association of Health Plans): \nWe support S.B. 251.  \n \nCARI HERINGTON (Executive Director, Nevada Cancer Coalition): \nWe support S.B. 251. \n \nGEORGE ROSS (Comprehensive Cancer Centers of Nevada): \nWe support S.B. 251.  \n \nMARIAN GANSERT: \nI support S.B. 251. My story is similar to Ms. Whitaker. I was never flagged \nduring the course of my breast cancer history. It started 36 years ago when I \nwas diagnosed with breast cancer and had a mastectomy on my left side. I was \n30 years old and was told not much was known about breast cancer at the \ntime. Years later, I decided to be proactive and have a preventative mastectomy \non my right side. In 2015, I went to my annual gynecology appointment and \nwas told I was eligible for genetic testing. My test came back positive. I was \nthen told the BRCA 2 gene had a 50 percent chance of developing into ovarian \ncancer and a 90 percent chance of developing into breast cancer. Two months \nlater, I had a total hysterectomy. Since I also had two mastectomies, I thought I \nwas doing great. It did not turn out that way. \n \nIn 2017, I was diagnosed with cancer on my preventative mastectomy side. I \nguess a piece of breast tissue had been left behind. I had both my children \ntested and they tested negative. To my knowledge, my mother never had breast \ncancer. I do not know of anyone on my mother or father's side having breast \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \ncancer. I have a granddaughter who will be born in May, and in the back of my \nmind, this baby will eventually have to be tested for the BRCA gene. \n \nKENDAHL SERVINO: \nI support S.B. 251. I am a medical student at UNR and breast cancer survivor. I \nwas diagnosed at 20 years of age; it was the biggest shock of my life and the \nhardest  struggle  I  ever  had  to  face.  I  received  chemo,  radiation  and  a  few \nsurgeries while finishing up my last semester of college. Losing my hair and my \nconfidence and becoming unable to recognize myself in the mirror were the \nhardest parts of treatment for me. I hope none of you will ever experience or \nhave to face breast cancer. I come here today to share the importance of BRCA \ngenetic testing and having this bill passed. The number of lives that will be \nsaved by passing this bill will be tremendous.  \n \nMARLENE LOCKHARD (Nevada Women's Lobby): \nWe support S.B. 251. This bill can and will save lives. \n \nERIN LYNCH (Social Services Chief, Division of Health Care Financing and Policy, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nWe are neutral on this bill. Nevada Medicaid covers genetic screening, testing \nand counseling for BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 for both men and women. There is a \nzero dollar fiscal note on this bill. \n \nROBBIN PALMER, PH.D (Certified Genetic Counselor): \nI am neutral on this bill and have several concerns about this legislation even \nthough it is well intentioned. I am the only practicing genetics professional in \nnorthern Nevada. I have provided written testimony (Exhibit M). \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nI was reviewing the bill again and want to note a violation of section 1 would \nstill be a misdemeanor. If it is your intention to take away all penalties, you may \nwant to draft another amendment to exempt it as well. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe had the testimony from Medicaid. There is no fiscal note because these are \nservices already available for almost everybody in the Medicaid population. You \ntestified earlier we are already doing this with insurance companies, and it is \npart of federal law and part of the essential benefits included in the Affordable \nCare Act by reference to preventive services. Is this your understanding? \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \nSENATOR SEEVERS GANSERT: \nYes. It is part of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations \nwhich is what is relied upon for preventive services. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWhy  have  the  insurance  components  in  the  bill  if  Medicaid  and  insurance \ncompanies are already providing these services? \n \nSENATOR SEEVERS GANSERT: \nIn speaking with the Legislative Counsel Bureau's Legal Division, I learned if we \nwere able to put this in the bill, then we would preserve the coverage even if it \nwere changed at a federal level. We want to make sure Nevadans have access \nto this counseling and testing, and this is why we want it in statute. \n \nThe federal government covers BRCA 1 and BRCA 2, and genetic medicine will \nbe refined over the years. There are genetic mutations which we know can be \nlethal, and I want to have testing for those. If we can get testing for BRCA 1 \nand BRCA 2, and you look at the pie charts provided by Dr. Slotnick, you can \nsee the magnitude of how many people can potentially test positive and what \nthe outcomes can be. \n \nWe  do  not  have  enough  genetic  counselors,  but  what  we  do  have  are \nphysicians and practitioners who can learn more about genetics. We do not \nhave licensure as we are not at that level. Once people test positive, they are \ngoing  to  have  relationships  with  their  practitioners  to  make  decisions.  The \ndecisions may be they go on birth control or have a mastectomy, but those \ndecisions can be made between a patient and a physician. Making sure we have \npeople screened is extremely important. We can save a lot of lives with this \nlegislation. \n \n \n   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 18, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe  hearing  on  S.B.  251  is  now  closed.

(BDR 38-397) \n \nZACH CONINE (State Treasurer): \nAssembly Bill  62  helps  to  innovate  and  strengthen  the  Nevada  Achieving  a \nBetter  Life  Experience  (ABLE)  Savings  Program  to  ensure  Nevadans  with \ndisabilities have the opportunity to save for a better future. \n \nBroadly speaking, ABLE accounts are tax-advantaged saving accounts that allow \npeople with disabilities to earn and save money without losing access to vital \nbenefit  programs  like  Medicaid  and  Social  Security.  These  tax-free  savings \naccounts are made available to individuals to cover qualified disability-related \nexpenses such as education, housing and transportation. This program aims to \nease the financial burden faced by people with disabilities who are the most \nunderemployed demographic group in our State. \n \nIn  the  2019  Legislative  Session,  our  Office  worked  with \nAssemblywoman Lesley E.  Cohen  from  Assembly  District  No.  29  and  the \nDivision  of  Aging  and  Disability  Services  of  the  Department  of  Health  and \nHuman Services (DHHS) to pass A. B. No. 130 of the 80th Session. This bill \nmoved the entire ABLE Savings Program into the State Treasurer’s Office. Since \nthat time, our Office has worked with hundreds of Nevadans with disabilities \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 3 \n \nand their families to ensure access to these accounts without any impact on the \nState’s General Fund.  \n \nThe provisions of A.B. 62 would make Nevada the first State in the Country to \nfind  innovative  ways  to  incentivize  people  with  disabilities  to  open  these \naccounts  and  build  account  balances  to  ensure  all  Nevadans  have  the \nopportunity to save money and earn a living regardless of their abilities.  \n \nERIK JIMENEZ (Senior Deputy State Treasurer): \nWhen  we  took  over  this  program  from  the  Division  of  Aging  and  Disability \nServices,  there  were  under  200  accounts;  we  now  have  1,100  to \n1,200 accounts with zero dollars from the General Fund. This program has been \ninstrumental in changing lives for every person who opens an account.  \n \nThere are asset and resource limits based on certain programs for Medicaid, \nSocial Security and State disability services that prohibit a person from saving, \nearning  a  living  and  providing  a  pathway  out  of  poverty  for  people  with \ndisabilities.  People  who  qualify  for  ABLE  savings  accounts  are  those  with \ndevelopmental and intellectual disabilities, long-term disabilities that significantly \nhinder one’s ability to live life.  \n \nThis bill is a simple bill but an impactful one. I speak with families on a daily \nbasis to set up accounts. The biggest barrier to opening an account is that the \nperson,  guardian  or  caregiver  does  not  have  the  initial  funds  to  open  the \naccount. Right now, it takes $25 to $50 to open an account. Because the \nperson is on a fixed income one oftentimes does not have the extra resources to \nopen the account.  \n \nThis bill would allow us to seek federal grants, donations and other sources of \nfunds to establish a method similar to what we do for the Nevada College Kick \nStart Savings Program to incentivize the opening of an account. To make this \nwork, we would craft regulations allowing someone to open an account with an \ninitial contribution from $50 to $100 depending how much we can raise in \nfederal funds, gifts, grants or donations. \n \nThe  next  step  for  this  bill  is  finding  resources  for  the  program,  perhaps  in \nanother legislative session if appropriate for a General Fund appropriation, to \nencourage people to maximize their savings and develop regular savings habits \nby incentivizing them through matching contributions. The College Kick Start \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nSavings Program gives $50 to every kindergartener in Nevada. If we replicate a \nsimilar model, we could see a lot of success. \n \nCONNOR CAIN (Nevada Bankers Association): \nThe Nevada Bankers Association supports A.B. 62 as an innovative bill that \nwould  make  Nevada  the  first  State  in  the  Country  to  strengthen  its  ABLE \nSavings Program by accepting gifts, grants and donations.  \n \nBAILEY BORTOLIN (Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers): \nThe Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers offers our support of A.B. 62. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on A.B. 62 and open the hearing on S.B. 188. \n \nSENATE BILL 188: Establishes programs for certain persons of low-income and \npersons in foster care. (BDR 38-711) \n \nSENATOR PAT SPEARMAN (Senatorial District No. 1): \nAccording to Prosperity Now, in 2021 nearly 13 percent of Nevadans have \nincomes below the federal poverty level. That is $12,880 for an individual and \n$26,500  per  year  for  a  family.  In  addition,  credit  and  debt  are  significant \nproblems.  Nearly  one  in  three  consumer’s  credit  card  debt  is  more  than \n75 percent of his or her total credit limit. One in four Nevadans has an account \nin collections. This information, although current, does not take into account the \nfinancial abyss most of our neighbors are in due to the Covid-19 pandemic. \n \nCredit and debt issues can lead to other harmful financial decisions, such as \nrelying too heavily on alternative or predatory financial products. Approximately \none in four Nevada households is considered underbanked. This means despite \nhaving a checking or savings account, they rely on nonbank alternative financial \nservices like check cashers, payday lenders or pawn shops to make ends meet. \n \nSenate Bill 188 aims to help low-income Nevadans accumulate assets, become \nmore  financially  literate  and  achieve  specific  financial  goals.  This  legislation \nseeks to bring hope and opportunity to low-income, low-wealth Nevadans by \ncreating  the  Individual  Development  Accounts  (IDA)  Program.  Qualifying \nresidents will be able to save and grow their money through matching funds to \nenhance their financial security. The IDA Program will provide those who need \nhelp, the most opportunity to save money toward secondary education, starting \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \na new business, purchasing a home or investing in other categories. Enhanced \nfinancial  capabilities  will  enable  IDA  participants  to  improve  their  overall \nfinancial  well-being  and  build  a  foundation  for  continued  economic  growth, \nrealizing a new level of security in difficult times. \n \nThe inception of the bill is from a time when we lived in the projects. You could \nnot  earn  more  than  a  specific  amount  of  money  or  you  would  lose  your \neligibility. You could not have a car that was two years old. Most of that has \nnot changed. The social service programs are not designed to give people a \nhand up, but rather to create generational poverty. This bill came out of a desire \nto say those who are in public or assisted housing need an opportunity to save \nwithout losing their eligibility or social services.  \n \nI asked the question, what happens when a child in foster care turns 18 years \nof age? The answer was they are out of the system. Does this mean the child is \nout the system in 30 days a year? I cannot imagine being an 18 year old who \nhas had a childhood totally in the foster care system, was never adopted or \ntaken in as a foster child, or spent time in four or five different households. Now \nyou are on your own and you have nothing. Senate Bill 188 answers the moral \nimperative; how will we help those who are the least among us? \n \nAt a high level, the bill provides for the establishment of the IDA Program in \nNevada.  The  program  is  based  on  a  similar  initiative  in  Oregon. \nSections 15 through  25  require  the  Office  of  the  State  Treasurer  to  solicit \ngrants, gifts and donations to carry out the program and establish the program if \nsufficient funds are obtained. This is predicated on having the funds to get this \nprogram started.  \n \nSection  20  authorizes  the  Office  of  State  Treasurer  to  select  one  or  more \nfiduciary organizations to administer the funds in the program and distribute a \nportion of the funds to the DHHS foster care licensing agencies and housing \nauthorities  to  provide  instruction  in  financial  literacy  to  account  holders. \nWherever people are, there is no wrong door. If they are in subsidized housing, \nfoster care, wherever they are, they have access to financial literacy courses \nthat will help them not only get out of poverty but help them save so they can \nremain well-sufficient for the rest of their lives. \n \nSection 21 provides qualifying criteria to be an account holder. Specifically, a \nperson must be a resident of Nevada. The account holders must be 12 years of \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nage or older to ensure we get children in the foster care system young enough \nso their IDA Program can grow. At the age of 18 they would have enough \nmoney to be financially secure when they age out of the system. The account \nholders must also be tenants living in government subsidized housing in Nevada, \nMedicaid recipients or foster care providers who create accounts for children in \ntheir care. \n \nThe bill helps account holders’ balances grow because for every dollar deposited \ninto the account, the fiduciary organizations deposit up to $5 in matching funds \nproviding there are funds available. This is for $3,000 deposited into an account \nin any 12-month period.  \n \nSections  2,  36  and  38  prohibit  Medicaid,  local  housing  authorities  and  the \nNevada  Rural  Housing  Authority,  respectively,  from  considering  the  funds \ndeposited into IDAs to be income when determining a person’s eligibility for the \nrespective programs. This is designed specifically to help people who are in \ngovernment-subsidized housing to help foster children be financially stable when \nthey turn 18 years of age.  \n \nOftentimes, people would like to purchase a house but are in a program that \nstates they cannot have more than $1,000 per year in the bank. Most down \npayments are $5,000. If you can never save that, you will always be in that \nhousing situation. For foster care children, the foster parents can set it up, but \nthis account is for the foster child, not a bank for the foster family. \n \nSections  5  through  14  create  the  Nevada  Statewide  Council  on  Financial \nIndependence. The Council is responsible for developing Statewide priorities and \nstrategies  to  help  people  who  receive  public  assistance  or  social  services \nincrease their financial independence, coordinate with certain state agencies and \noversee the IDA Program if it is established. \n \nSection  33  requires  the  State  Treasurer  ensure  instruction  and  training  in \nbusiness opportunities, and any benefits available to certain business enterprises \nare provided to tenants of local housing authorities, the Nevada Rural Housing \nAuthority  and  certain  nonprofit  organizations.  To  help  the  State  Treasurer \naccomplish the goals in S.B. 188, section 32 authorizes the Office of the State \nTreasurer to appoint and employ a Deputy of Financial Literacy and Security.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nGoing into the pandemic, many Nevadans were barely holding on. In 2019, \nVice President  Kamala  Harris  said  most  households  with  a  $400  emergency \nwould most likely fall off the financial cliff and not be able to easily recover. For \nso  many  people  who  were  working  and  self-sufficient,  and  to  an  extent \nfinancially independent, this pandemic has brought them to their knees. Many \npeople had a home and lost it or were renting with the hope of purchasing a \nhome, which is no longer a reality. We are looking at people who desire to be \nother than where they are in the social strata. We have a moral obligation to \nmake sure people who are in public or subsidized housing can save to purchase \na home or start a small business and employ others. For children in foster care, \nonce they age out, the best thing we can do for them is help them save so \nwhen they do turn 18 years of age, they will understand how to use money, not \nabuse it.  \n \nThe  IDA  Program  is  designed  to  teach  people  how  to  become  financially \nindependent. It is not a handout, it is a hand up. We are told to lift ourselves up \nby the bootstraps. Some people do not have boots—some barely have socks. If \nthe litmus test is how quickly you can lift yourself up, there are some among us \nwho will never be able to do that. This is an opportunity for them to do just \nthat.  \n \nTREASURER CONINE: \nAs Senator Spearman stated, IDAs are matched savings accounts that allow \nresidents with lower income to save for defined goals without losing access to \nessential programs like Medicaid and low-income housing services. Throughout \nthe Country, IDAs have helped to increase financial literacy and management \nskills for people in disadvantaged communities while helping to build pathways \nout of poverty. Looking at IDA Programs around the Country, participants are \n35 percent more likely to own a home, twice as likely to attend an institution of \nhigher learning and 84 percent more likely to start a business.  \n \nIn the State Treasurer’s Office, we manage the Nevada ABLE Savings Program \nthat allows people differently abled to save money without losing access to \nmuch needed benefits. Senate Bill 188 would further that work to help groups \ngain access to financial vehicles they need to advance their economic mobility.  \n \nIn the State of the State Address, Governor Steve Sisolak emphasized how the \nimportance in increasing Nevada’s share of federal grant funding will play a part \nin our economic recovery. By directing our Office to work collaboratively with \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nthe DHHS, we identified sources of grant funding necessary to ensure Nevada’s \nlower income residents have the tools they need to be a major part of our \neconomic recovery. \n \nIn addition to bringing more federal dollars back to Nevada, we can also work to \ncreate  the  vital  savings  option  tenants  of  low-income  housing,  Medicaid \nrecipients and foster youth across Nevada need. \n \nMR. JIMENEZ: \nForty-two states have an IDA program in some shape or form. Typically, how \nthese programs work is a state entity, board, commission or agency will work \nwith a network of nonprofits which are defined as fiduciaries under the bill. To \nadminister, market and do outreach for these programs, IDA contributions set \nup by an individual are then matched to a specific dollar amount. We are trying \nto figure out how we can help an individual save for a defined goal, such as \neducation, housing or purchasing a new car to help the person get to work, \nmaking those dollars go further. If we allow the money from the contributor \nonly,  those  dollars  do  not  go  as  far.  The  State  has  oversight  over  those \naccounts  like  our  Office  would  with  any  other  program  we  have.  Those \nnonprofit fiduciaries help provide financial literacy services to the individuals \nwith those accounts.  \n \nPre- and post-pandemic low-income individuals have struggled, especially with \nthe effects of Covid-19. The State needs to develop a body or framework to \nmake  sure  we  can  help  individuals  develop  strategies  and  have  the  tools \nnecessary  to  achieve  financial  independence.  We  can  all  agree  that  helping \nsomeone save and get out of poverty is important.  \n \nA number of states use different vehicles to fund IDAs. Approximately 10 states \nuse General Fund for their programs, and 15 use Temporary Assistance for \nNeedy Families funds to support the programs. Five states use their Community \nDevelopment Block Grant funds and two states use housing trust funds. There \nis potential for federal vehicles to help get this program off the ground. \n \nLAWRENCE WEEKLY (Former Clark County Commissioner): \nI support S.B. 188. I am a native Nevadan born into the system as a newborn \nand at two days old was turned over to the foster care system. Because of the \nState of Nevada and the village concept, there were social workers who cared \nfor me when I did not have a family to call my own. It was not until I became a \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nClark County Commissioner that I saw my original birth certificate for the first \ntime.  This  put  me  into  counseling.  There  was  no  first  name  on  the  birth \ncertificate. As a grown adult male, this devastated me realizing I came into the \nworld with no identity.  \n \nMany young people have gone through this traumatic system. They did not ask \nto be born into this world and have been tossed from household to household \nnot receiving parental love. The joy of having a child, and that child being able \nto look into his or her parents face knowing this is genuine love is something I \ndid not experience until I was 11 months old when taken out of the system.  \n \nI was not traumatized or abused. I had two loving parents who could not have \ntheir own child, and I was adopted by them. I did not find out I was adopted \nuntil  I  was  almost  a  teenager.  This  is  where  my  life  became  whole. \nUnfortunately, my parents divorced when I was seven years old. My mother \nwas forced to go on government assistance because of the abuse she endured.  \n \nI  am  currently  in  a  doctoral  program  writing  my  paper  on  aged-out  foster \nchildren. As I do my research, I hear stories from children aging out of the \nsystem finding themselves sleeping under freeways and bridges or on top of \nroofs to stay safe. They eat out of garbage cans because they have no place to \ncall their own and do not know where their next meal will come from.  \n \nIf we can provide at least one more opportunity, one more resource for a child \nwho has probably not received the tools necessary he or she would need to go \nout into the world, this would be another feather in the cap for Nevada. This \nwould show that we as Nevadans do care. I am a prime example of what \nhappens when people are provided the necessary resources.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe  work  hard  in  this  Committee  to  destigmatize  mental  health  and  mental \nhealth treatment. I was adopted at five days old and have my birth certificate \nfrom Washoe County that states I was born in a house in Washoe County. I \nwas  one  of  the  lucky  ones  to  be  adopted  by  parents  who  have  been \nphenomenal in my life and know that not all children are as lucky as I was. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI have a question on setting up a supervisory entity. Is that in the State purview \nor do we create a new entity? Are the $3,000 of matching funds ever taxed \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nwhen  taken  out  of  the  account?  Who  is  the  donor,  and  if  the  donor  is \nincentivized to donate, does the donor receive a tax write-off of some kind? \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nWe had three-to-one match from the General Fund last Session when the bill \nwas introduced. This Session we took that out and added the language “to the \nextent that money is available.” In terms of being incentivized, there is not a \ntime  I  have  watched  television  and  not  seen  a  commercial  for  St.  Jude’s \nChildren’s Hospital or someone asking for money for abused animals. People \nwho see the worth  of this can and will donate,  especially in light  of what \nhappened in the pandemic. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI do not believe these funds are tax-deferred so should not be taxable when \nwithdrawn.  \n \nMR. JIMENEZ: \nThat is the case. There are some federal statutes governing IDAs. I will check \non this and get back to the Committee. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nAre the matching funds, which would be five-to-one, matched by donations \nwhere funds are available through gifts, grants and donations?  \n \nWhen a tenant moves from low-income housing, do they no longer have the \nopportunity to have matching funds added to the IDA? \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThe  vision  of  the  program  is  for  people  in  subsidized  housing,  living  in  a \nlow-wealth community who would like to purchase a home but do not have \naccess to the program and do not know how to save for the money. If they did \nknow,  it  would  be  counted  against  their  eligibility  either  for  Medicaid  or \nlow-income housing. This program is for people in that situation. Once they \nreceive  the  money  needed  for  a  down  payment  on  a  home  or  to  start  a \nbusiness, they are no longer eligible for Medicaid or low-income housing. This is \nthe purpose for offering classes on financial literacy, to help them get to a place \nwhere they can live their dream while understanding how to use money and not \nlet money use them. This will help lift people out of the situation they are in. \nWe want to help the situation so the destination will be better. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIf children are 12 years old and move out of the tenant or housing project when \n15 or 16 and they keep the account until they need the funds, are they no \nlonger eligible to receive the matching funds specifically designed for them in \ntheir IDA program? \n \nMR. JIMENEZ: \nSenator  Hardy,  you  had  mentioned  the  entity  to  manage  the  program.  In \nprograms such as savings programs or retirement savings, the details of the \nentity to manage the program are regulations that are promulgated through the \nboard. We want to ensure we have flexibility.  \n \nThe intention now is no General Fund dollars are to be used. However, it could \nbe  from  private  philanthropy  or  through  federal  dollars.  The  program  is \ninteresting in that it is flexible for recipients of Medicaid, low-income housing \nand foster youth. We might find a bucket of federal funding we could use for \none  of  those  populations  but  not  others.  If  we  find  funding  specifically  for \ntenants  of  low-income  housing,  we  could  partner  with  a  nonprofit  offering \nservices to those tenants and make sure we could rightsize the program to meet \nthose needs.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWhen people have been living in low-income housing and moved out, or have \nbeen on Medicaid and now they are not, do they go in and out of eligibility to \nparticipate? Once they are anchored in, can they continue to participate? \n \nMR. JIMENEZ: \nIn the circumstance you described, there may be a need for some regulatory \nclarification. The money saved and matched while a person was eligible for the \nprogram would follow that person. I am not sure if the person was no longer \nreceiving  Medicaid  or  living  in  subsidized  or  low-income  housing  the  match \ncould occur after that point. \n \nTREASURER CONINE: \nThere are comparable examples in some of our 529 College Savings Plans which \nhave matches based on income. That match goes away if the person or family \ngoes over an income line for a time but the underlying 521 Exempt Asset does \nnot. If the family went out of eligibility and then back in, they would again \nqualify for the match. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nSection  20  charges  the  State  Treasurer  to  solicit  funds  for  the  matching \npayments by a fiduciary institution. Section 25 states the fiduciary organization \nhas the sole authority and responsibility for the administration of the IDAs, and \nthe  responsibility  of  the  fiduciary  organization  extends  to  all  aspects of  the \nprogram including soliciting matching funds. Who does what? It appears the \nprogram, in section 25, is totally turned over to the fiduciary organization. What \nis the role of the State Treasurer at that point? \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nSection 25 states “subject to any regulations adopted by the State Treasurer”. \nYour question is one that will be considered when they are in the regulation \nwriting portion of this program. It is not that responsibility turns over but is \nsubject to any regulation adopted by the State Treasurer.  \n \nMR. JIMENEZ: \nIn other states, the nonprofit fiduciary does a lot of the leg work. You do bring \nup a good point on asset oversight and management. If that is something you \nwould like to see in section 25, we could clarify that to ensure the State is \nserving some sort of advisory or oversight rule. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nDo the funds deposited into the bank accounts specifically go to a financial \ninstitution? \n \nMR. JIMENEZ: \nYes. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nCan you give an example of the type of nonprofit that service these programs? \n \nMR. JIMENEZ: \nOur community nonprofits that provide a number of services could service the \nprogram. It is difficult now as we are not authorized to do that as a State, so \nwe do not have nonprofits that are currently doing this work. In other states, \nyou will see if there is a nonprofit that specifically provides services to newly \nmade citizens. If it could operate an IDA for the population it serves whether a \nhousing  coalition,  a  homelessness  prevention  group  or  an  eligible  nonprofit \nserving foster youth. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThe basic criteria is that the nonprofit status is in accordance with Internal \nRevenue Service 501(c)(3) regulations. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nNonprofits have a difficult time raising money now. What type of process is \nthere to ensure they have matching funds? What happens if they sign people up \nand they cannot raise the funds for a match? \n \nMR. JIMENEZ: \nThere is a section of the bill that requires the State Treasurer to determine, in \nconsultation with the board, who qualifies to be a fiduciary organization. When \nwe talk about matching funds as contemplated under this bill, they are limited \nto the availability of funding brought in through federal or grant funding. We \nwould have to do an analysis of how much funding we anticipate bringing in \nand scale the program appropriately to ensure it would not run out of matching \nfunds.  \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIn the bill, it is not the State Treasurer’s responsibility to raise the matching \nfunds, it is the responsibility of the fiduciary. If ten accounts are created and \nthey can only fund five based on the money they have raised, who is held \naccountable and what accounts get shorted? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSection 20 of the bill reads that it is the role of the Office of the State Treasurer \nto solicit and apply for gifts, grants or donations to the extent that sufficient \nfunds are obtained, establish the program and authorize a certain number of \naccounts based on the funds obtained. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nYes, however, section 25 gives the power or sole authority to the fiduciary \norganizations. The administration of the accounts and the responsibility of the \nfiduciary organization extends to all aspects of the program including, without \nlimitation, soliciting matching funds as shown in subsection 1, subparagraph (b). \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe  may  be  struggling  with  the  mechanics  of  how  this  would  work. \nUnderstanding regulatory processes will bring clarity, and it cannot contradict \nwhat is actually in the bill. Can this be addressed today? \n \nMR. JIMENEZ: \nI agree there is some conflicting language and it would make sense for us to \ncome  back  with  an  amendment  to  clarify  the  language  regarding  rules  and \nresponsibilities. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs your intent that the State Treasurer’s Office approves a specific number of \nslots and the fiduciary manages those slots? \n \nMR. JIMENEZ: \nCorrect. If it were the reverse, you could run into a situation where you may \nhave created too many accounts and not be able to find a potential match. The \nmatch is not set, it can vary from $1 to $5. It is not guaranteed that every \naccount created would get a $5 match. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe match is set based on a predetermined agreement between the account \nholder and fiduciary. The fiduciary does not get to vary how much it deposits \nonce a month if it is a fixed amount. \n \nMR. JIMENEZ: \nFor the long-term sustainability of the program, it would have to be a fixed \namount. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThe regulatory process, and all other processes associated with this, will be \ndone with the State Treasurer’s oversight. Part of the clarity we might achieve \nwith an amendment is to make sure we identify what those are and how it \nrelates to each section of the bill. The fiduciary does not start the process, it is \nthe State Treasurer who is the overseer or chair of the financial board, and the \nLieutenant  Governor,  or  their  designee,  is  the  vice  chair.  Nothing  happens \nwithout the approval of the State Treasurer. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nOn the list of items the account can be created for, does it have to be specific \ngoing in, or is it a general account that can be used for any of these purposes? \n \nMR. JIMENEZ: \nThe  bill  specifically  states  it  can  be  used  for  postsecondary  education,  job \ntraining, purchasing or renting a home, starting a business and various other \nuses. I have seen this done both ways, and this is something the board will \nhave  to  weigh  in  on.  One  way  is  similar  to  how  we  would  operate  an \nABLE savings account as long as it meets any of the qualifying expenses. In \nother states, the person must set a defined goal going in, such as saving for the \npurchase of a house or a car, and then that is what it would be used for. How \nthe language is drafted does not make a decision either way, but I have seen it \ndone both ways. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe way I read it, the initial agreement with the fiduciary had to be set up for a \nspecific purpose that included one of these purposes. A statement of intent \nabout what you are planning would be beneficial. In section 22, subsection 2, \nparagraph (m) referencing the payment of medical expenses; sometimes medical \nexpenses are not anticipated. We need clarity over that because the way it was \ndescribed,  you  would  use  part  of  the  program  for  financial  literacy  and \neducation to accomplish the goal of why you started the program, and then exit \nthe  program.  This  seems  to  be  more  of  a  rolling  account  which  serves  a \ndifferent purpose. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI am interested in your experience with these programs in other states. It would \nbe ideal if these accounts would not affect any existing benefits someone may \nbe receiving. For many of our benefits there is an asset test. I am curious as to \nwhether we know these do not impinge on the benefits someone may have. If \nsomeone  is  in  affordable  housing,  which  can  be  such  a  critical  linchpin  for \nlong-term success, the establishment of one of these accounts does not put the \nperson at risk for losing this benefit. How are we getting around that when \nmost of those rules are set by the federal government? \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThe bill states the entities that provide the services shall not count that against \nsomeone’s eligibility. It also states it is subject to federal regulations. If the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nfederal  government  says  you  cannot  have  more  than  $2,000  in  a  specific \naccount, we cannot go over and above that amount. We have been asked why \nthis amount is so low. We took into consideration what the regulations are now \nat  the  federal  level  and  tried  to  say  we  would  not  go  above  that  amount \nresulting in the $3,000 limit. I had considered $3,500 but need to make sure it \ndoes not get close to the federal government amount.  \n \nThe amount of other money raised will have to be predicated on making sure it \ndoes not cause anyone to lose benefits according to the federal government. \nThere are things the housing authority and the Nevada Rural Housing Authority \nneed to check on to ensure the amount does not go above their eligibility limit. \nThis is the vision, but we also know we have to walk in step with the federal \ngovernment.  \n \nI have been on a crusade talking to our federal delegation trying to explain to \nthem the federal system is not designed to help people move out of poverty. As \nlong as people cannot have a bank account with over and above a certain \namount of money or a car that is less than so many years old, you will always \nhave generation after generation experiencing poverty because they cannot save \nmoney. In many cases, even if they could save they do not know where to go \nto get the financial literacy they need.  \n \nBETH HANDLER, M.H.P. (Deputy Director, Programs, Department of Health and \nHuman Services): \nIn our agency analysis, the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services that \ndecides Medicaid eligibility found no impact and would be good to go with the \nlanguage as written. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWho gets chosen for how much money goes into these individual accounts? Is \nit equitable to everyone, or can the donor direct the funds to just foster care or \nsingle parents of children, or can an individual direct money to his or her own \naccount and have the donation matched? How is it directed to the individual? \n \nTREASURER CONINE: \nDepending on the source of the funds, it may go to a specific group. If you \nwere to get a grant to help support the well-being of individuals in foster care, it \nmay  be  specifically  for  that  segment  of  IDA  accounts.  If  we  got  a  federal \nCommunity Reinvestment Act grant from a bank, or an individual wanted to add \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nfunds,  or  as  we  do  with  anyone  wanting  to  fund  a  program,  the  State \nTreasurer’s Office works with the grantor on what is wanted to ensure we \nmake it equitable and managed appropriately. Those decisions would be made \non a board and grantor level. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThere must be some kind of understanding where the funds go, otherwise it \nbecomes arbitrary. \n \nTREASURER CONINE: \nThe source of the funds help to determine where it will go. You want to ensure \nthat it is equitable when the funds come in, especially those from gifts or grants \nas opposed to General Fund dollars. In terms of gifts and grants, the grantors \nshould have an opinion on where those funds go. If they are committed to the \nsupportive care for individuals in the foster care system, we want to ensure \ntheir dollars went to support those IDA accounts. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWhat you are describing could be a tax write-off for the grantor. \n \nTREASURER CONINE: \nThat is possible. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nCan an individual donate to his own savings account, and if so, get matching \ndollars into that account? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThat is the foundational concept. Every matching dollar is a match to a gift the \nowner of the account adds. Account holders do not get any matching donations \nunless they make a donations.  \n \nMR. CAIN: \nThe Nevada Bankers Association supports S.B. 188. I echo Senator Spearman’s \nremarks in stressing the importance of helping low-income Nevadans and other \nvulnerable  members  of  our  community  accumulate  assets,  become  more \nfinancially  literate  and  achieve  their  financial  goals.  Having  a  few  hundred \ndollars in your bank account can make all the difference in the world when the \nunexpected happens.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nMS. BORTOLIN: \nAt  Washoe  Legal  Services  and  Legal  Aid  Center  of  Southern  Nevada,  we \nprovide attorneys to children in foster care for the cases they are involved in. \nFrom that aspect and as an advocate for those children, the Nevada Coalition of \nLegal Service Providers supports S.B. 188. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nThank you for considering what I believe will be a monumental step forward in \nhelping those who are in public or subsidized housing and children in the foster \ncare system.  \n \nThere is an African proverb that says, “It takes a whole village to raise a child.” \nI would add, “It takes a whole child to raise another village.” \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 188 and open the hearing on S.B. 205. \n \nSENATE  BILL  205:  Provides  regulatory  exemptions  for  certain  types  of \nresidential and commercial boilers. (BDR 40-839) \n \nSENATOR MOISES DENIS (Senatorial District No. 2): \nSenate  Bill  205  addresses  an  oversight  that  occurred  when  emergency \nregulations were adopted last year by the Division of Industrial Relations (DIR) \nof the Department of Business and Industry.  \n \nIn adopting regulations related to boilers, the Division exempted certain gas fire \nresidential  and  commercial  tank  water  heaters  but  unintentionally  failed  to \nexempt similar tankless water heaters. The result is that tankless water heaters \nare  now  subject  to  significantly  more  onerous  regulations  than  similar  tank \nheaters and are more stringent than necessary to ensure public safety. The goal \nof this bill is to seek parity in statutory regulation of tank and tankless water \nheaters so this type of regulatory error is not repeated. \n \nWe worked with the DIR and there is a proposed amendment (Exhibit B) to \nclarify the intent of the bill and address certain concerns raised by the Division. \n \nWARREN HARDY (Rinnai America Corporation): \nThis  bill  corrects  an  oversight  created  last  year,  as  noted  in  my  memo \n(Exhibit C). This issue is something we have spoken about with our competitors, \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nthe construction industry and others impacted by this regulatory oversight with \nbroad support. \n \nThe  proposed  amendment,  Exhibit  B,  would  replace  the  bill  as  a  whole.  In \nproposing this amendment, we are trying to create a level of parity. There was \nan  oversight  with  the  emergency  regulation  which  created  a  disparity  in \nattempting to exempt small commercial and residential water heaters.  \n \nWe are attempting to fix the oversight and go forward in legislation instead of a \nregulatory change. As the Legislative Session was right around the corner, we \nestimated it would take a year to a year and a half to promulgate a regulation to \ncorrect  this.  More  importantly,  we  thought  it  was  important  to  put  this  in \nstatute now that tankless water heaters are becoming more desirable and a \nbigger part of the industry. Tankless water heaters are safe, take up a lot less \nspace and easier to provide the redundancy so many people are looking for. We \nthought it best to have these two types of products brought on par in statute so \nif a regulation is promulgated, we do not make the same mistake. \n \nAfter the boiler explosion that occurred at the University of Nevada, Reno, the \nDIR appropriately promulgated regulations to increase safety requirements and \nstandards on the large boilers. In doing so, they recognized the need to exempt \nsmall water heaters and did so in the regulation. The regulation did not extend \nthe exemption to tanked water heaters.  \n \nThe  proposed  amendment,  Exhibit  B,  section  1,  subsection  1  defines  water \nheater as an individual controlled unit. The language was taken at the request of \nthe DIR. The three-pronged approach to be eligible for the exemption is listed in \nsubsection 1, paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), and mirrors the regulation. \n \nThe  DIR  would  like  to  regulate  the  in  series  installation  of  water  heaters. \nIn series water heaters are popular because they save energy and are far more \nefficient. Some gyms set up a series of five or six in series water heaters, and \nwhen  the  demand  is  low,  they  may  run  one  of  them.  When  the  demand \nincreases as more people use the facility, they will increase incrementally until \nthey  are  at  full  capacity.  When  you  use  a  tanked  water  heater,  you  are \nfunctioning at maximum capacity all the time. This means the gas is being used \nto heat the water in anticipation of full capacity.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nAn example of where these may be used in parallel or in a series is a restaurant \nthat  has  requirements  in  code  to  have  hot  water  available  at  all  times.  If \nrestaurants water heaters go out they are out of business, so they will set up \ntankless water heaters or tanks in parallel or in a series. In most cases, gas-fired \ntanked water heaters are set up in parallel to provide that redundancy.  \n \nSenate Bill 205 will correct the disparity in that these two types of technologies \nare treated differently and unfairly. If this is not corrected, and these additional \nregulatory  requirements  apply  to  tankless  water  heaters,  it  will  create  a \nsignificant disincentive for people to install these units because of the additional \nregulatory requirement.  \n \nThe DIR staff members indicated they were unsure they had the authority to \npromulgate a regulation on in series installations. We were asked if anything in \nthe bill would foreclose on their ability to adopt a regulation. In reality, the \nlanguage we are proposing would do the opposite and would direct the DIR to \npromulgate a regulation. They told us it may take a year to promulgate that \nregulation. What about safety in the interim? Massachusetts is the only state in \nthe Union that regulates in series installations.  \n \nAll these in series installations are accounted for in local safety regulations. All \nthe products we are talking about are constructed and designed contemplating \nin series installations. It is common and done across the Country. It should go \nthrough a regulatory process involving the industry in its entirety and not done \naccidentally by the adoption of an emergency regulation. \n \nJAMES YORK (Rinnai America Corporation): \nThis should be a rule-making process because there are nuances that need to be \naddressed which could include permitting based on a system or individual units. \nSay more than one unit installed that exceeds one of the three hurdles on a \nbuilding site becomes regulated, does that mean apartment buildings that have \nindividual  water  heaters  serving  individual  units  become  regulated,  since \ncurrently they are not? Ambiguity will need to be worked through during the \nregulatory process; many items not yet considered will come from the industry. \n \nMR. HARDY: \nWe  need  to  bring  tankless  water  heaters  on  par  with  tanked  heaters  for \npurposes of the statutes and regulations as they currently exist. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe bill is in response to the emergency regulation which is appropriate given \nthe devastating event at the University of Nevada, Reno campus given the scale \nof that explosion and the fact we did not have significant injuries or casualties is \nclose to a miracle.  \n \nThe intent of Senate Bill 205 is to make a correction for an exception and a \npiece of that exception left out was tankless water heaters. Is everything over \nand above that a request of the DIR? \n \nMR. HARDY: \nCorrect. The DIR accepted the language and the definition we had but wanted \nto add the word “single” and are “exempt” if you install a single tankless water \nheater. That puts us at a significant disadvantage and does nothing to fix our \nproblem. Inadvertently, the addition limits us significantly if it limits our ability to \ninstall these in series, which is a common and growing practice in the industry. \nIt is allowed by code and manufacturer. There was an attempt to prevent the \nserial installation of tankless water heaters in this legislation. If that were to \noccur, there would not be the same exemptions or prohibition against in series \ninstallations of tanked heaters that there is for tankless. \n \nNo one knows if or how many tanked water heaters are installed in series. The \nmanufacturers provide instructions on how to install them and they are regularly \ninstalled in parallel to provide redundancy.  \n \nCRAIG  MADOLE  (Nevada  Chapter  Associated  General  Contractors,  Nevada \nAssociation of Mechanical Contractors): \nThe emergency regulation adopted to clarify these smaller hot water heaters \ndoes not require inspection by the state boiler inspector and was pursued and \nadopted on our behalf. It has since been adopted as a permanent regulation. \nWhat was important to understand is that we never contemplated tankless hot \nwater heaters when we were working with the DIR, so this was an oversight on \nour part. We support S.B. 205 with the amendment. If additional regulations are \nrequired, we would work with the DIR to adopt appropriate regulations. This \nfrees up the boiler inspectors to inspect boilers instead of the small hot water \nheaters. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nJORDAN KRAAGNBUHL: \nI support S.B. 205 and the proposed amendment, Exhibit B. I am the Executive \nDirector for the Plumbing Heating and Cooling Contractors of Nevada. I have \nbeen  involved  in  code  writing  for  30  years  both  locally  and  nationally.  The \nUniform Plumbing Code, which is adopted across the state of Nevada, clearly \ndefines what a water heater and boiler are. The threshold of not exceeding \n120 gallons,  200,000  BTUs,  etc.,  gives  manufacturers,  designers  and \ncontractors  code  requirements  for  designing,  permitting  and  installation  and \ninspection. Local jurisdictions require permits and inspections for water heaters. \nBoilers are required to be permitted and inspected by the state. Senate Bill 205, \nas amended, would clarify issues regarding water heater and boiler installations, \npermitting and inspections. \n \nVICTORIA CARREON (Administrator, Division of Industrial Relations, Department of \nBusiness and Industry): \nOur agency is neutral on S.B. 205. The mechanical compliance section within \nthe DIR regulates the safety of boilers. Normally we do not think about boilers, \nbut when one has a problem as in the case of the University of Nevada, Reno, it \ncan be an issue. We take seriously the issue of regulating them and ensuring \nthey are safe for the public.  \n \nWe support providing parity between tankless and tanked water heaters. Water \nheaters with the specifications proposed to be exempted present a low-safety \nrisk and do not need to be permitted. This applies to both tanked and tankless \nwater heaters. However, we are concerned the proposed amendment, Exhibit B, \nwhich allows these water heaters to be installed in a series without a permit. In \nNevada,  there  are  numerous  installations  where  you  can  have  five  tankless \nwater heaters linked together to replace a one million BTU individual boiler. This \ncan be a good thing in that it is more energy efficient and less expensive. They \nshould  be  permitted  because  there  are  things  we  need  to  look  at  such  as \nemergency gas shutdown switches, emergency exits, fire rating of the room \nand room ventilation. When you have that much gas in a room, we feel it needs \nto be reviewed. We do regulate these installations that are in a series.  \n \nThe bill allows regulations to be created for water heaters installed in a series; \nhowever, there would be a gap in time when these installations would not be \nregulated.  It  is  important  to  note  they  are  currently  regulated.  This  is  our \nconcern. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nYou  stated  there  are  regulations  applying  to  multiple  in-line  tankless  water \nheaters. Do we have regulations that apply to multiple in-line traditional water \nheaters? \n \nMS. CARREON: \nToday there is nothing that states multiple installations are regulated just by \nvirtue of all of the waters being regulated. The various types of installations are \nall regulated. This new statute would exempt certain types and create a new \nexemption for those regulated in a series. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAre you saying the way the proposed amendment, Exhibit B, is drafted it would \nexempt  not  only  tankless  water  heaters  but  also  traditional  water  heaters \ninstalled in a series? \n \nMS. CARREON: \nYes. It would exempt those that are tanked; however, in Nevada we are not \naware of any multiple series tanked water heaters that are installed. It would be \nmore efficient to install a larger boiler. The in-line installation is an issue for the \ntankless water heaters. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWere it to happen the legislation as drafted would exempt it. \n \nMS. CARREON: \nYes. The legislation would exempt tanked water heaters by having tanked and \ntankless  water  heaters  exempted  from  in-line  installation,  but  only  tankless \nwater heaters are installed in a series. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThis will take some research by our legal team. It seems we have a difference of \nopinion from the representatives of the bill saying they are not regulated, only \nregulated in Massachusetts, and the DIR is stating they are currently regulated. \nClarity is needed to understand what is and is not currently regulated and how \nthe proposed amendment, Exhibit B, would affect that. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \nMR. HARDY: \nWe  have  written  testimony  in  support  of  this  legislation  from  Navien,  Inc., \n(Exhibit  D),  D  &  D  Plumbing,  Inc.  (Exhibit  E),  Air-Conditioning,  Heating,  & \nRefrigeration  Institute  (Exhibit  F),  Bradford  White  Corporation  (Exhibit  G), \nGardner Engineering (Exhibit H), RHP Mechanical Systems (Exhibit I) and J & J \nMechanical Incorporated (Exhibit J). \n \nWith regard to the timing of the regulation, the issue is whether the State \ninjects itself into this. These installations, across the board, are allowed and \npermitted  and  are  subject  to  local  building  codes  which  are  very  specific. \nManufacturers construct and design the tankless and tanked water heaters for \ninstallation in a series. \n \nThe question is, does this rise to the level of Nevada requiring an additional \nregulatory  burden  on  those  who  install  these  and  additional  expense  for \ncustomers who want to install them? This is where only Massachusetts has \nmade the decision that it rises to extra regulation beyond what is done in the \nlocal code. It is appropriate for Nevada to create the extra regulation on boilers. \nBut, do we need to take the time to do the inspections on those already covered \nin addition by local code? \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIs that part of the International Building Codes the jurisdictions are adopting \neach year where they are covered by local building codes? \n \nMR. HARDY: \nYes. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIt  would  be  helpful  to  have  testimony  from  local  government  building \ndepartments to have their perspective on whether they are comfortable their \nbuilding codes are addressing the issue you are addressing. If you could provide \nthat for us, please do. \n \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 205 and open the hearing on S.B. 211. \n \nSENATE  BILL  211:  Establishes  requirements  relating  to  testing  for  sexually \ntransmitted diseases. (BDR 40-563) \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \nSENATOR DALLAS HARRIS (Senatorial District No. 11): \nSenate Bill 211 is fairly simple but huge in its impact. Per [HIV.gov], one of the \nelements of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is prevention services. This aspect \nof the ACA for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention includes HIV \ntesting for everyone ages 15 to 65 and for people of other ages at increased \nrisk without additional cost sharing, such as co-pays and deductibles. In 2006, \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended all people \nages 13 to 64 be tested for HIV at least once in healthcare settings. However, \nthe uptake of that recommendation has not been optimal.  \n \nWhile HIV testing by healthcare providers is supported by the ACA and the \nCDC,  many  clients  and  patients  are  not  routinely  offered  this  test  by  their \nproviders. The goal of this legislation is to normalize HIV testing as part of a \nperson’s regular healthcare screening. The hope is that the public health and \nmedical providers might be able to identify folks living with HIV earlier, get them \nmedical  care  and  ideally  help  clients  and  patients  achieve  viral  suppression \nwhich can in turn reduce the number of new HIV infections in the community. \n \nThis bill also includes other sexually transmitted diseases (STD) for the same \nreason. If we have learned anything from Covid-19, it is you need to know your \nstatus. Knowing your status helps with the spread, especially for these types of \ncommunicable diseases. We endeavor to end the pandemic through initiatives \nlike Ending the HIV Epidemic, which is being promoted to end the HIV pandemic \nin the United States by the year 2030. The key strategies are to diagnose, treat, \nprevent and respond.  \n \nThis legislation is not new to Nevada. There are other states are taking similar \nsteps. \n \nCHERYL RADELOFF (Southern Nevada Health District): \nDuring my testimony, I will be reviewing and referring to the bill presentation \n(Exhibit K) on S.B. 211.  \n \nSlide 2 reviews points to consider with this legislation. Often you will see STDs \nand sexually transmitted infections (STI) interchangeably. My understanding is \nthat STIs are typically seen more in public health settings.  \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \nI  recently  completed  a  training  for  academic  detailing  where  we  use  the \ntechniques  pharmaceutical  representatives  use.  Public  health  agencies  work \nwith providers to give them support on how to complete sexual histories.  \n \nSlide 3 continues with additional points to consider. \n \nSlide 4 has a diagram relating to continuum of care. There is the notion that \ncontinuum of HIV care is not just for treatment but also for prevention. The goal \nis for 90 percent of people to know their status, 90 percent of people diagnosed \nwith HIV get into care and ideally 90 percent become virally suppressed. There \nis a campaign called “Undetectable=Untransmittable.” If a person has HIV, the \nlevels of HIV can get to a point of being undetectable. It is powerful in that we \nare seeing when people have these low viral loads, they will not transmit the \nvirus which will drop what we know as community viral load.  \n \nIf someone tests negative or nonreactive, we want to link the individual to \nprevention services. There has been some discussion and  additional  bills on \nthings such as pre-exposure prophylaxis which is comparable to the birth control \npill. You can take a pill with the idea that if you are exposed to HIV you will not \ncontract  the  disease.  Postexposure  prophylaxis  is  where  you  can  take \nmedication for a month with the idea that if you have been exposed to HIV and \nbegin taking this within 72 hours, you would not acquire HIV. Counseling and \nother preventative services are also available. Ongoing counseling, research and \ntesting are important. \n \nSlide 5 covers ending the HIV epidemic in the United States. These pillars can \nalso be applied to STIs. \n \nSlide 6 covers HIV in Nevada. Many people living with HIV do not know their \nstatus. \n \nSlide 7 covers what we are looking at in terms of people living with HIV in \n2019.  Acquired  immunodeficiency  syndrome  (AIDS)  is  now  known  as \nStage 3 HIV. The majority of people newly diagnosed with HIV were diagnosed \nin Clark County. We see numbers rising in Washoe and other counties. \n \nThere is some powerful legislation for getting information on genders assigned \nat  birth  to  people  who  have  chosen  to  identify  with  a  different  sexual \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 27 \n \norientation or gender identity. This information is captured when we do disease \ninvestigation. \n \nSlide 8 reviews Nevada’s HIV care continuum. \n \nSlides 9 and 10 review Nevada 2019 HIV Fast Facts on New HIV Diagnoses or \nNew Stage 3 AIDS Diagnoses. It is important to note, in terms of inpatient, \nthese are people diagnosed who were in the hospital. By the time people are in \nthe hospital and given a diagnosis of HIV, or stage 3 AIDS, these people can be \nvery sick. We need to make sure we can test people before this point using \nroutine testing. As soon as someone is diagnosed with HIV, we can ideally get \nthem into care and virally suppressed, keeping them healthy. \n \nSlide  11  covers  how  the  cost  of  STIs  is  from  CDC  direct  medical  cost \nestimates, and that $1.1 billion is associated directly with chlamydia, gonorrhea \nand syphilis. These costs do not take into account the indirect cost of, for \ninstance, infertility, which can be associated with gonorrhea and chlamydia, or \npelvic inflammatory disease, cervical cancer, ectopic pregnancy, and heart and \nblood vessel damage.  \n \nSlide 12 covers the state of STIs in Nevada for 2019. In preparing for this \npresentation, I did some research and was concerned that in 2015 we had \n8 cases of congenital syphilis and in 2016 we rose to 12 cases. We were at \n21 cases in 2017, 34 cases in 2018 and 41 cases in 2019. Those rates are \nexponentially of major concern to us. Unfortunately, with congenital syphilis we \nare not alone. We are also seeing such an increase across the United States. \n \nSlides 13, 14 and 15 are showing us the rankings for primary, secondary and \ncongenital syphilis. The lion’s share of cases for congenital syphilis is in Clark \nand Washoe Counties; this is something to be concerned about. \n \nSlide 16 reviews what this legislation will do. We have seen with Covid-19 that \nfrom  the  beginning  of  the  pandemic  in  March  2020,  the  number  of  places \npeople  can  access  testing  has  increased  exponentially.  I  was  trained  as  a \ndisease investigator, and many of us shifted our roles to address the pandemic. \nTo see the changes that have occurred within a year is incredible. \n \nMany STIs are silent. A study done by the CDC showed about 10 percent of \nmen  and  5  percent  to  30  percent  of  women  with  lab-confirmed  chlamydia \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 28 \n \ndeveloped no signs or symptoms of an STI. This says that 90 percent of men \nand about 70 percent of females did not have any signs or symptoms and might \nnot have been tested because they would not have presented to their providers, \nthe patients may not have known. \n \nThe goal is to stop the spread of HIV, STDs, STIs and other communicable \ndiseases as well as promote and fast-track Ending the HIV Epidemic. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nWe know in the 1970s and 1980s HIV and AIDS blossomed so because it was \nconsidered a disease only some people contracted. If you were not that “type” \nof person, you did not have to worry about contracting those diseases. Why is \nit rising so fast?  \n \nMS. RADELOFF: \nEarly in the HIV pandemic, the assumption was we saw this predominantly \namong certain communities. What has changed is that we are seeing it among \nsome of those same communities, but it is not only sexual transmission. We \ncannot forget about the spread of HIV through blood to blood contact by people \nusing injectable drugs. When we look at categories of people, the only way \npeople know will know their status is to be tested. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nDo you have a handle on the age groups affected? \n \nMS. RADELOFF: \nWe are seeing high rates in both HIV and STIs in people 13 to 24 years of age \nand are addressing efforts toward youth and young adults. The highest rates in \nNevada tend to be up to 24 years of age; ages 13 to 18 are showing the \nhighest rates. We see some high rates in ages 24 to 30 and lesser amounts in \nthe 50 and over age bracket. We continue to see newly infected people or \npeople living with HIV. You many have long-term survivors in these numbers, \npeople who are newly diagnosed and new infections. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER:   \nThe requirement is that the test has to be offered, and if feasible, done in an \nemergency or primary care setting. What are the various tests necessary to run \nthe gambit of what we are testing for, and what is the feedback loop time for \ntests? Is it a blood test that is done? \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 29 \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nIt is my understanding that primary care providers are covered and there are \nmany  people  who  use  urgent  care  facilities  as  primary  care  providers.  The \nphysicians in those facilities would be covered under the bill. I would be willing \nto look at a possible amendment if we feel that is needed. \n \nWhen it comes to asking for the test, you are correct. They just need to ask, \nand it can be done in-house, if offered there. If not, the facility or physician can \nassist  in  facilitating  testing,  which  may  include  going  to  a  facility  such  as \nLabcorp or Quest to have the test done.  \n \nThe  way  I  envision  this  working  is  not  particularly  to  cover  any  sexually \ntransmitted diseases but more the general panel of tests done for STIs. It is not \nmeant to create any additional testing for things we do not already test for. We \nwant  to  ensure  we  are  offering  tests  to  everyone  as  a  regular  course  of \npractice. \n \nMS. RADELOFF: \nBlood tests are typically associated with testing for HIV and syphilis. We have \nrapid tests for HIV so people can get results in as soon as 1 minute or up to \n20 minutes, and this can be done in-house. We are now advocating three-site \nSTD testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia in the site people may have been \nexposed. The information cannot be obtained through a blood test for these; it \nmust be site specific. \n \nI believe urgent care facilities are also covered under this legislation since many \npeople use urgent cares as their primary providers.  \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIs there a standard panel for STDs or one specific for the disease someone will \nbe tested for?  \n \nMS. RADELOFF: \nThe typical tests performed for an STD or STI panel would be HIV, syphilis, \ngonorrhea and chlamydia, which could be a physical inspection. The blood draw \nwould be through the arm or a finger stick. The home test for HIV is done as an \noral mucosa cheek swab, and that can take up to 20 minutes for results. The \ngonorrhea and chlamydia test could be a urine sample or site specific where \npeople might have been exposed. That would be part of the dialogue with the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 30 \n \nprovider while obtaining the sexual history to get an idea of where the individual \nmay have been exposed so the proper test is done.  \n \nIf people were engaged in an activity that could put them at risk and would not \ninvolve say a urine sample that was collected, you would miss the diagnosis. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nThis is meant to be a discussion between the patient and their physician. What \ntests are appropriate to one and when? We are not going to prescribe from the \nState level. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe concern might be that in an emergency room setting, it is not necessarily \nthe patient and the primary physician, so that conversation may be difficult. \n \nAre these tests covered under ACA preventative care coverage so there is no \ncharge to the patient, or are they billed to the patient if they are uninsured or \nunderinsured? \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nIt is my intention these services will be billed in the same way they are currently \nbilled. For some that may be through the ACA and for others billed through their \ninsurance provider with a possible co-pay. This bill would not affect how these \nare billed through your insurance or any other mechanism.  \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDoes section 1, subsection 4, paragraph (a) eliminate criminal penalties if this \nlaw is not followed? \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nYes. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWhat is your ideal vision for the roll-out plan? This includes physician, physician \nassistant, advanced practice registered nurse and midwife. If the patient in the \nemergency room has no relationship with the physician at that visit or another \nfederally qualified health care center, how do we get the word out to providers \nthis is something they are supposed to do? Are we able to provide, through the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 31 \n \npublic  health  systems,  some  education  or  information?  Are  we  hoping  the \nmedical association is going to help out with this? \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nI have the Health Districts for Washoe County and Southern Nevada working \nwith me on this and imagine they would be one conduit to get the information \nout. Generally, this is good medical practice to be asking for these tests.  \n \nANDRE WADE (Silver State Equality): \nI support S.B. 211. Ending the HIV epidemic is finding out one’s status through \ntesting. This bill would increase people’s knowledge of their status so they \nwould not transmit HIV unknowingly. When we normalize testing in a health \ncare environment throughout the system, it destigmatizes HIV. On a recent visit \nto my doctor, he was hesitant asking about HIV testing. When I asked why he \nwas hesitant, he said he did not want people to be taken off guard by asking. If \nhealthcare providers are required to ask about testing, it would make a world of \ndifference in Nevada where the rates of infection are high. \n \nBRADLEY MAYER (Southern Nevada Health District): \nThe Southern Nevada Health District supports S.B. 211. \n \nJOELLE GUTMAN DODSON (Washoe County Health District): \nThe Washoe County Health District supports S.B. 211. \n \nCARLA MICIANO (Southern Nevada Asian Pacific Islander Queer Society): \nThe Southern Nevada Asian Pacific Islander Queer Society supports S.B. 211 \nbecause it establishes requirements for HIV and STD testing. Current medical \npractices require a patient to initiate the conversation regarding their desire to \nobtain HIV and STD tests rather than the provider. This bill requires the provider \nto  ask  the  patients  if  they  would  like  to  be  tested,  allowing  for  greater \nidentification, removing the barrier to testing, improving treatment outcomes \nand  reducing  stigma  surrounding  the  issue.  We  know  HIV  and  STDs \ndisproportionately  affect  the  Asian  Pacific/Islander,  lesbian,  gay,  bisexual, \ntransgendered and queer communities. This bill would move Nevada in a better \ndirection to end the HIV epidemic. \n \nJOSEPH HECK, D.O. (Nevada Osteopathic Medical Association): \nThe Nevada Osteopathic Medical Association opposes to S.B. 211. While we \nwould encourage all primary care providers to be better disciplined in bringing up \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 32 \n \nthis conversation with their patients, we have significant concerns with the bill \nas drafted which is laid out in a letter provided (Exhibit L).  \n \nWhile most of the presentation given by Ms. Radeloff revolved around testing \nfor HIV, the bill is much more encompassing to include STDs of which there are \nmore than 20 with no requirement for any clinical correlation to the tests that \nare being ordered. Which tests should be ordered if there is only a blanket \nrequirement?  \n \nWhile  the  ACA  does  provide  for  required  services  to  be  covered  as \nrecommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force, it should be \nnoted that this is only true for A and B recommendations. For men, there is no \nrecommendation  for  gonorrhea  or  chlamydia;  therefore,  that  would  be  an \nout-of-pocket expense. For syphilis, there is recommendation A only in certain \ncategories of individuals who have other high-risk criteria.  \n \nThere cannot just be a blanket test for all STD or STIs be covered. In addition, \nhaving these done in an emergency room significantly increases cost since this \nis  the  most  expensive  place  to  receive  care  and  would  have  no  direct \nconnection to the potential presenting complaint of the patient. A 16-year-old \nfrom a high school football game coming in with a sprained ankle is going to get \nan X-ray. Is this the time you want to bring up a conversation about testing for \nSTDs?  \n \nWhile we applaud the efforts to increase diagnosis, prevention and treatment, \nthere are significant logistical concerns with the bill as drafted. \n \nDUANE  YOUNG  (Deputy  Administrator,  Division  of  Health  Care  Financing  and \nPolicy, Department of Health and Human Services): \nThe Division has placed a fiscal note based on increased utilization. We have \nspoken with Senator Harris and are working with the Division of Public and \nBehavioral Health and other partners to mitigate some of those costs. We feel \nthis is good policy and is in line with promotional efforts that the Division made \nin conjunction with the Division of Public and Behavioral Health to promote \nSTD testing through its fee-for-service and managed care programs. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nThis is not a bill that requires mandatory testing. It only requires the question be \nasked. What tests are performed will be a conversation between the doctor and \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 33 \n \nthe patient, as it should be. There is no requirement that someone be tested for \nevery STD, simply that the doctor ask would you like a test for STDs and HIV.  \nWe have seen what the numbers were in Ms. Radeloff’s presentation. By simply \nrequiring doctors to ask for these tests, we can make a dent in those numbers. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 211. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe remainder of page intentionally left blank; signature page to follow.   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 34 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSeeing no public comment, the meeting is adjourned at 6:28 p.m. \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \n \n \n \n   \nVickie Polzien, \nCommittee Secretary \n \n \nAPPROVED BY: \n \n \n \n   \nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \n \n \nDATE:     \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 23, 2021 \nPage 35 \n \nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \nBegins \nExhibit \nBill   on  Witness / Entity  Description \nLetter \nPage \n  A  1    Agenda \nWarren Hardy / Rinnai \nS.B. 205  B  1  Proposed Amendment \nAmerica Corporation \nWarren Hardy / Rinnai \nS.B. 205  C  1  Support Memo \nAmerica Corporation \nKevin Pirotin / Navien, \nS.B. 205  D  1  Support Statement \nInc. \nWaylon Lowery / \nS.B. 205  E  1  Support Statement \nD and D Plumbing, Inc. \nAlison Maginot / Air-\nConditioning Heating \nS.B. 205  F  1  Support Statement \nand Refrigeration \nInstitute \nEric Truskoski / \nS.B. 205  G  1  Bradford White  Support Statement \nCorporation \nRobert Gardner / \nS.B. 205  H  1  Support Statement \nGardner Engineering \nMike Scolari and \nS.B. 205  I  1  Robert Sandoval / RHP  Support Statement \nMechanical Systems \nMargaret Cavin / J and \nS.B. 205  J  1  J Mechanical  Support Statement \nIncorporated \nCheryl Radeloff / \nWashoe County and \nS.B. 211  K  1  Bill Presentation \nSouthern Nevada \nHealth Districts \nNevada Osteopathic \nS.B. 211  L  1  Opposition Statement \nMedical Association \n ", "\nSENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \n \nEighty-first Session \nMarch 25, 2021 \n \n \nThe Senate Committee on Health and Human Services was called to order by \nChair Julia Ratti at 3:34 p.m. on Thursday, March 25, 2021, Online.

Could you talk about the \nsequencing of how this would work? \n \nTYLER KLIMAS (Executive Director, Cannabis Compliance Board): \nWe have these in our regulations. This just provides more flexibility to figure out \nwhat would be on them and what is best served on a label included with the \nproducts. The regulations we have now would not go away if this was passed. \nIt takes exactly what should be on there out of the statute and moves it to the \nBoard to continually be flexible as it promulgates regulations. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nAre you continuing to do the exact kind of labeling until the Board's regulatory \nprocess is in place, which is not a slow process? \n \nMR.

(BDR 38-705) \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nSENATOR JULIA RATTI (Senatorial District No. 13): \nSenate Bill 274 is one of my top priorities for this Legislative Session. It follows \nS.B. No. 293 of the 80th Session. This bills seeks to make sure when a child is \na victim of sexual exploitation for money and has been trafficked, the child will \nbe treated as a victim and then survivor in the child welfare system as opposed \nto being treated as a perpetrator in the juvenile justice system. When we looked \nat this same concept last Session, I was convinced if we said it is mandatory, \nno child can go into the juvenile justice system who has been trafficked in \nthis way. \n \nThere was not sufficient time to transition our systems from juvenile justice and \nchild welfare, and we would risk putting some children in danger. We passed \nS.B. No. 293 of the 80th Session to give the juvenile justice systems, legal aid, \npublic  defenders,  child  welfare  systems  and  nonprofits  time  to  have \nconversations about how we get there. We wanted to do it in a way that puts \nthe best interest of the child first with a trauma-informed approach to make sure \nthe child has the support he or she needs.  \n \nWe also gave the State money to hire a consultant to facilitate that process. \nThis allowed great conversations between the different agencies and institutions \nthat would interface with the child who has, unfortunately, been the victim of \nsuch a horrific crime. We also started to talk about what would be necessary for \nus to transform the systems, and that has resulted in S.B. 274. This bill starts \nto  build  out  some  of  the  structures  necessary  to  get  us  there.  I  have \ntwo subject matter experts here, Bailey Bortolin from the legal aid community, \nwho brought forward this bill concept and has been actively involved in the \nworking group since last Session, and I have Kathryn Roose from the Division of \nChild and Family Services (DCFS), who has helped to lead some of this work. \n \nKATHRYN ROOSE (Deputy Administrator, Division of Child and Family Services, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nI  am  honored  to  present  S.B.  274  which  revises  provisions  relating  to \ncommercially  sexually  exploited  children  (CSEC).  The  bill  has  three  major \ncomponents. First are regulations that allow for the establishment of receiving \ncenters. Second is a legal framework for involuntary commitment for the child \nto a receiving center. Last are provisions for DCFS to certify other programs for \nserving this population. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nThe conceptual amendment (Exhibit E) has been developed with stakeholders. \nKey changes include section 7 to locate the receiving center licensing authority \nin  Nevada  Revised  Statutes  (NRS) 424  while  maximizing  potential  federal \nrevenue to support receiving centers. Sections 19 through 27 make changes to \nthe emergency admission process while streamlining the process to create court \nefficiencies and remove requirements that may lead to barriers to services. The \n\"detain\"  language  will  be  replaced  with  \"placement,  assessment,  and \ntreatment\"  to  ensure  the  ability  to  maximize  potential  Medicaid  revenue. \nAdjustments to NRS 432C language reflect assessment instead of screening. \n \nI will walk you through the major concepts of the bill. Sections 10 through 13 \ndiscuss receiving centers as licensed secured facilities that operate 24 hours a \nday, 7 days a week to provide specialized inpatient and outpatient services to \nCSEC.  It  also  requires  DCFS  to  develop  licensing  requirements  and \ncorresponding regulations, and describes the services that shall be available to \nyouth in the receiving center. \n \nSection  14  describes  the  process  for  admission  into  the  receiving  center, \nincluding  emergency  admission,  court-ordered  admission  and  voluntary \nadmission. The second category of the bill provides the legal framework for \ninvoluntary placement. This changes the most substantially with the conceptual \namendment. \n \nSections 15 through 27 describe procedures governing emergency admissions \nand court-ordered admissions. This includes requirements to attempt to contact \nparents,  provides  for  retention  of  counsel  to  represent  the  child,  requires  a \nhearing following an emergency or court-order admission and requires a hearing \non court-ordered admissions every five days while the child is in the receiving \ncenter.  \n \nIt  is  important  to  note  that  the  regulations  around  the  receiving  center  are \npermissive. They do not require identified CSEC to be placed into a receiving \ncenter, they just lay out the framework for the model. \n \nSection 16 authorizes DCFS to require certification of other types of facilities or \norganizations other than receiving centers that provide services to CSEC. It also \nallows  DCFS  to  adopt  regulations  regarding  certification,  if  necessary,  and \napplication for the issuance or renewal of certificates and related activities. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nFinally, S.B. No. 293 of the 80th Session prohibits adjudication of a child who is \nalleged  to  have  violated  certain  laws  relating  to  prostitution  if  there  is \nreasonable cause to believe that the child is commercially sexually exploited. \nEffective July 1, 2022, the language in S.B. 274 in section 35, postpones that \ndate until July 1, 2023. Those are the main components of the bill. \n \nBAILEY BORTOLIN (Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers): \nThe final report (Exhibit F) from the working group at DCFS, Senate Bill 293 \nReport, was robust work. We looked at what other states are doing; however, \nthere are not a lot of models. This is an emerging area for states to develop \nservices; there is widespread agreement that this is the correct policy. This is \nthe shift we need to make for these children. We are all putting our heads \ntogether to figure out how we fiscally make this happen. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nI  want  to  provide  more  context  in  challenges  faced  with  this  particular \npopulation.  A  child  is  recovered  because  of  frequent  interactions  with  law \nenforcement and found to be a victim of a crime of sexual exploitation. Some of \nthose children have a stable home with parents who are ready and able to assist \nthem. We need to wrap that family with support and make sure children are \nsafe while we reconnect them to their parents, so those parents take over their \ncare and assume the lead role, determining if they need counseling. There is a \nshort period of time when that child may be under the influence of a pimp or \nothers who may encourage that child to run. \n \nThere is the critical time period when that child would end up in a juvenile \nfacility in most cases today. Rather than that happening, this receiving center \nconcept is a child welfare-centered space that would have a locked door, but \nthe child would be living in the child welfare system with the supports and \nservices that come along with that system. In other cases, there may be a \nquestion about the  ability for the  parents to assist a child.  There might be \nneglect, sometimes abuse, and that child would then transition into the child \nwelfare system anyway because this triggers a new set of processes and rules \nwithin the system with any child where there is a question of neglect or abuse. \nIn that case, the receiving center is a space to take care of that child while \ntransitioning  into,  perhaps,  the  foster  care  system,  treatment  placement  or \nwhatever is the next step. Not every child who is sexually exploited will have \nthe  same  path.  It  will  depend  upon  other  life  characteristics  to  determine \nwhether he or she continues in the child welfare system. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nIn all cases, this bill seeks to keep children out of the juvenile justice system \nbecause of a strong philosophical underpinning that they are victims and not \nperpetrators. They should not be treated as criminals, rather as victims so they \ncan become survivors and get the support they need. \n \nIt is disturbing that not a lot of good work is being done across the Country on \nthis issue. If any state gets this right, it is Nevada because of the many facets \nof  a  tourism-driven  economy,  special  events  we  draw  people  to  and  the \nunfortunate number of children trafficked into and throughout our State. If we \ncan lead the Nation in this space and show others how to do it, that is where \nwe need to go. It is not possible to build the whole thing in a short period of \ntime, but it is critically important for the children, and we are making steps in \nthe right direction. I have been pleased with the commitment of the nonprofits, \nand State and county agencies to do something quite challenging and to do \nright by these children. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nI am trying, in my practice, to be more intentional about language. Is there a \nreason why we chose the phrase \"receiving center\"? Is there the ability for \nlanguage that is more people-centered aside from a receiving center? \n \nMS. ROOSE: \nThe  term  \"receiving  center\"  was  discovered  by  the  S.B.  No.  293  of  the \n80th Session work group that spent the Interim Session working on reaching \nout  to  every  state  in  the  Nation  to  see  what  states  are  doing  with  this \npopulation and how we are best serving these children. The states of Georgia \nand Washington both have models for receiving centers. Georgia's center has \nbeen in place over a year, and Washington passed a bill to open two receiving \ncenters in July. The term has already been used in the Country. I have no \nparticular attachment to the term. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nI had the same thought you did about the term. Do any facilities now meet the \nqualification of a receiving center? \n \nMS. ROOSE: \nNo. County facilities could be more easily transformed into receiving centers, \nbut nothing exists as outlined in the bill to include being a secured facility with \nthe type of staffing required for a receiving center. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nThat is the reason for the extension of the bill deadline. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIs it a vision that the receiving center will be a subset of a larger facility? \nSection 12, subsection 2, paragraph (d), looks like a subset of a larger structure \nor  organization.  Section  16,  says  DCFS  may  adopt  regulations  requiring \ncertification  of  a  facility  or  organization,  other  than  a  receiving  center,  if  it \nprovides these type of services. Would there be a new set of regulations for a \ncounseling group that provides mental health services, potentially? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nIt could be a specialized foster home. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe term organization rather than facility made me think it could be an LLC, a \ngroup of mental health counselors. I appreciate the bill. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nYou stated it could be a specialized foster home. It has to be secure and secure \nfrom escape and other people coming into the home? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nYes, if that was one of the models. If it serves the receiving center function, \nthere could be a portion or entire facility that did have the ability to be locked \nand keep people from either leaving or coming. We want to create the structure \nand  work  on  the  language  so  these  facilities  can  qualify  for  Medicaid  and \nfunding. The counties and nonprofit groups need to put their heads together, \nonce they see funding streams, about facilities and services that can be built. \nHowever, a locked facility with an ability to place and treat is part of the model. \n \nMS. BORTOLIN: \nThe receiving center model would be for the initial contact in some cases where \nappropriate.  We  still  want  to  comply  by  the  least  restrictive  environment \nnecessary.  A  comprehensive  model  to  provide  services  specific  to  this \npopulation would need to have multiple levels. Specialized foster care, in and of \nitself, would not be the locked part, but some youths in foster care may be \nrequire that setting. In that case we do not want to escalate. By the same \ntoken, someone in the initial contact who comes in through the receiving center \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nmay de-escalate as they receive services. It is about building a model that works \ncomprehensively throughout the system of care as the child's needs change. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nI  mixed  those  two  things  up.  The  receiving  center  is  separate  from  the \nspecialized foster care. I am retracting my former answer, so please follow what \nMs. Bortolin just stated. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe  goal  then  is  to  get  this  paid  for  and  Medicaid  eligible.  We  want  the \nreceiving center to have the ability to get federal money, is that correct? \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nYes. The goal of the bill is to tie this component, the receiving center, to federal \nTitle IV-E foster care dollars. We are also trying to set up a system of care, but \nnot all of it is represented in this bill. The language of this bill is important so \nthat as the child moves out of the receiving center into other forms of care, \nthen Medicaid and Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) dollars can kick in. Title IV-E \nfederal funds are important if we are to shift from juvenile justice into child \nwelfare. \n \nMS. BORTOLIN: \nThe receiving center language is permissive; the goal is to get there. There is \nagreement with the policy, and counties want to get there. The language must \nbe flexible to allow them to build it in a way that works for them. There may be \npossible VOCA dollars and ways to integrate Medicaid dollars. Decision-making \nis with the county that ends up owning this receiving center process. \n \nJOHN  PIRO  (Chief  Deputy  Public  Defender,  Clark  County  Public  Defender's \nOffice): \nWe support S.B. 274. This is a solution-focused bill. We were in support of the \nbill from last Session where its aim was to help victims and provide services. It \nis our goal, both at Clark County and the Washoe County Public Defender's \nOffice, to stop a cycle of victimization. The intent of this bill does just that. We \nsupport this intent because it moves away from arresting child victims who \nhave been victims of horrendous crimes and detaining them as if they are the \ncriminals,  which  the  juvenile  justice  system  does  to  these  young  men  and \nwomen.  We  favor  and  support  moving  away  from  that  model  and  into  a \nsupportive  model.  We  will  continue  to  discuss  due  process  issues  with  the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nsponsor. We fully support moving away from criminalizing these young children \nwho  are  not  criminals  and  should  no  longer  be  treated  as  criminals  by  the \njuvenile justice system. \n \nSERENA EVANS (Nevada Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual Violence): \nWe support S.B. 274. Trafficked youth should not be treated like perpetrators. \nThey  need  to  be  treated  like  victim  survivors  rather  than  be  punished  and \ndetained  in  juvenile  justice  centers.  These  individuals  require  empathy  and \nresources, and we are in favor of adopting this new bill to provide the necessary \nsupport for these youth in this State. \n \nTESS OPFERMAN (Nevada Women's Lobby): \nWe support S.B. 274. Sexually exploited children must be viewed as victim \nsurvivors and be treated as such. The establishment of a receiving center is \ncritical to ensure these children are given appropriate treatment and protection \nto  get  them  away  from  the  human  trafficker  and  out  of  being  the  sexual \nexploitation victim. Some of the children in these situations may be addicted to \ndrugs, may have committed illegal offenses and may be under the power and \ncontrol  of  a  pimp.  These  children  may  or  may  not  have  stable  living \nenvironments outside of their situations. A receiving center will address the \nmany complicated situations presented to ensure excluded children are not sent \ninto the juvenile justice system but given the treatment and protection they \nneed.  This  bill  is  one  solution  to  a  multifaceted  issue,  and  we  urge  the \nCommittee's support. \n \nDASHUN JACKSON (Director, Children's Advocacy Alliance): \nWe  support  S.B.  274.  It  is  extremely  important  for  youth  who  have  been \nvictimized and exploited. This bill establishes youth are victims, not criminals, \nand we need to treat the abuse as such. \n \nJIM HOFFMAN (Nevada Attorneys for Criminal Justice): \nWe support S.B. 274. The bill introduced last Session was an important step \nforward, and this bill provides a strong framework for effectuating the goal, \nhelping kids who get caught up in bad situations. We have similar concerns to \nthose expressed by Mr. Piro. In particular, we are concerned about the provision \nthat would delay the implementation of S.B. No. 293  of the 80th Session, \nleaving victims to face continued criminal prosecution for another year. We are \nalso concerned about the bill's provision for charging parents for the use of the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nreceiving center, which also conflicts with a bill passed last Session to take fees \nout of the juvenile system. We are hopeful these issues can be addressed. \n \nBRIGID  DUFFY  (Director,  Juvenile  Division,  Clark  County  District \nAttorney's Office): \nWe support S.B. 274. We have been working with stakeholders to make sure \nwe have a strong bill to ensure children—who are actually victims of child sex \ntrafficking—are not treated as criminals. \n \nAMBER HOWELL (Director, Human Services Agency, Washoe County): \nWe are testifying in neutral on S.B. 274. Until today, we were not aware of the \namendment that changes language to allow us to maximize our Title IV-E funds. \nWe  believe  in  the  policy  and  change  in  the  model,  but  we  want  to  do  it \nsuccessfully and maximize federal funding to decrease as much of the general \nfund portion of the county as possible. We look forward to coming back in \nsupport once we work on the language. \n \nJOANNA JACOB (Clark County): \nWe are testifying in neutral on S.B. 274. We are working with the bill sponsors, \nthe State, child welfare agencies, nonprofits and many stakeholders on how to \nmeet the intent of the bill. We keep moving forward to develop a system of care \nfor our CSEC youth, understanding the importance of this issue. This bill in its \noriginal form would have had a significant fiscal impact to the county. We are \nworking to address those impacts with the amendments presented today. We \nhope  to  revise  the  fiscal  note  as  the  bill  works  through  the  process.  It  is \nimperative for Clark and Washoe Counties to maximize as much federal funding \nas we can to continue these services. As the safety net for our community, we \nmust  build  a  system  of  care  to  support  this  fundamental  shift  away  from \njuvenile justice to the child welfare setting. The child welfare setting is a totally \ndifferent  concept.  We  operate  in  the  best  interest  of  the  child  that  is \nfundamentally different from the juvenile justice setting, which is why it is such \na shift. \n \nThe system of care we want to build is one that may take us some time, \nconsidering  we  have  limited  resources  as  does  the  State.  That  is  why  we \nappreciate working toward this and the extension of time to build the correct \nsystem. We want it to be successful. We estimate that in southern Nevada, \n100 to 150 CSEC youth are identified by law enforcement and child welfare \nevery year. About half of those youth are coming through our child welfare \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nsetting. This number is quite likely higher. We are working on this and have \nreferrals and whole teams at Clark County that partner with juvenile justice and \nthe Las Vegas Metro Police Department to assess and provide services once we \nare contacted through a hotline under NRS 432C. \n \nWe appreciate the language in the conceptual amendment. We understand this \npopulation may need intensive services at times. In other states, the housing \nsupport for this population can cost up to $400 to $600 per day because of the \nintensive need for staffing and counseling. Clark County is entering the next \nbudget  year  with  an  estimated  structural  deficit  of  $29  million  in  our  child \nwelfare setting. We are facing further cuts in the State budget, and we must \ncontinue to deliver these critical services to our community. The new amended \nversion of the bill may not be without its costs, but we are committed to getting \nthis done.  \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nI want to express my gratitude to the professionals I am working with on this \nbill,  including  the  juvenile  justice  system,  child  welfare  and  nonprofits  who \nservice these youths who have had such a devastating experience. I do not \nwant to leave the impression that the individuals and professionals who work in \nthe juvenile justice system do not care as much about kids as those who work \nin the child welfare system. This bill is about the children being treated as \nvictims who can become survivors as opposed to being treated as criminals. I \nwant to be clear, this bill draws a line in the sand to say we are not going to \ncontinue to do this any longer. That line was July 1, 2022; the amendment \nproposes July 1, 2023, to give people more time to build a system. It enables \nreceiving  centers,  but  if  a  receiving  center  does  not  get  built,  that  line \nstill exists. \n \nWe want the child welfare system to step up and get the juvenile justice system \nto step back when it comes to the issues. After a few years of trying, we \ncannot quite figure out a way. Being 100 percent transparent, the bill reads that \nby this day, it will happen. A much better system can be built. I recognize \nNevada has a long way to go in children's mental health, and that will be true \nafter this bill passes. We probably will not have the systems of care we want to \nserve all youth, let alone these youth. I am no longer willing to say that because \nwe do not have that system it is okay for that child to be walking around with \nan ankle bracelet. That is the context of this bill. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nVICE CHAIR SPEARMAN: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 274. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will open the hearing on S.B. 96. \n \nSENATE  BILL  96:  Makes  various  changes  relating  to  services  provided  to \npersons with autism spectrum disorders. (BDR S-89) \n \nSENATOR JAMES OHRENSCHALL (Senatorial District No. 21): \nI am passionate about helping the autism community and will be presenting \nS.B. 96. With me today is Bailey Bortolin with the Coalition of Legal Service \nProviders  and  Julie  Ostrovsky  with  the  Nevada  Commission  on  Autism \nSpectrum Disorders. I will give some opening remarks and then Ms. Bortolin and \nCommissioner  Ostrovsky  will  present  the  bill.  Also  with  me  today  is \nAssemblywoman  Teresa  Benitez-Thompson,  Majority  Floor  Leader,  who  will \npresent an update on the Performance Audit, Delivery of Treatment Services for \nChildren with Autism 2020 (Exhibit G) and a friendly amendment (Exhibit H) to \nS.B. 96. \n \nIn 2019, I was here with many of the same people, presenting S.B. No. 174 of \nthe 80th Session, requesting this very same rate increase and an audit. This \nCommittee  supported  the  rate  increase  and  the  audit.  Unfortunately,  the \nmuch-needed Medicaid increase did not survive the 2019 Session due to a lack \nof  resources,  but  the  audit  did.  As  you  will  hear  from  Assemblywoman \nBenitez-Thompson, the Performance Audit, Exhibit G, strongly stated the need \nfor a Medicaid rate increase for registered behavior technicians (RBTs) providing \nautism applied behavioral analysis (ABA) interventions. In addition, the Audit \nexposed other challenges in the administration of some programs and found a \nfew discrepancies in reimbursements for ABA services. \n \nAs a result of this Audit, we have numbers to support this rate increase. We see \ntoo  many  children  being  left  behind  and  left  out  of  medically  necessary \ninterventions  due  to  a  shortage  of  providers  because  of  our  low  Medicaid \nreimbursement rates. Now we have the opportunity to do the right thing for this \nvulnerable population. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN TERESA BENITEZ-THOMPSON (Assembly District No. 27): \nI had the pleasure of serving as Vice Chair of the Audit Committee and am here \nin that capacity. Legislative Audit 22-04 was heard late in the year, past the \npoint where many bill draft requests had already been allocated. During the \nhearing, I told Senator Ohrenschall we are hearing the Audit your bill requested \nand finding good information. We are going to need a vehicle to continue this \nconversation on this bill. We need to talk about rates and get our rates figured \nout at the same time we are getting processes and systems worked out. He \nwas amenable to that, and I appreciate his bill which addresses concerns and \nissues within the Audit that make the most sense to continue with in statute. \n \nI will reference specific pieces from the conceptual amendment, Exhibit H, we \nare seeking to fix. The Division of Health Care Financing and Policy (DHCFP) \nshall biannually establish comparable market rates for the RBT, board certified \nassistant behavior analyst (BCaBA) and board certified behavior analyst (BCBA) \nlicensing types. \n \nThere are three types of licensing professionals who can do this work, and it \ndepends on their number of hours and training. The RBT requires a high school \ndiploma,  criminal  background  check,  40  hours  of  training  and  passing \ncompetency  assessments.  There  are  approximately  1,290  RBTs  licensed  in \nNevada.  The  other  rates  we  mentioned  are  the  BCaBA,  which  requires  a \nbachelor's degree with 180 hours in content area, principles, research methods, \nan additional 500 hours in intensive university practicum and 1,000 hours of \nsupervised independent field work. As of October 2020, there were 34 licensed \nin  the  State.  Lastly,  the  BCBA  requires  a  master's  degree,  750  hours  of \nintensive university practicum and 1,500 hours of supervised independent field \nwork. As of November 2020, there were 290 licensed in the State. \n \nPages 3 and 35 of the Audit found that Medicaid Services of the DHCFP is \npaying competitive rates compared to the market rate for two of those rates. \nThe one specific rate for the RBT was very much under the market rate. Private \ninsurers are averaging $62 per hour, and the Medicaid rate was $31 per hour, a \n$31 difference. The arguments we have been hearing and concerns from the \ncommunity are that because the RBT rate is so low and not competitive, we \ncannot get any of our children on Medicaid to receive these services. The Audit \nfound that was true. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nThe DHCFP shall establish reasonable limits to the number of service hours a \nprovider can bill in a 24-hour period and provide training on those rules. The \nAudit, pages 13 through 16, identifies issues concerning billing from private \nproviders. The number of hours being charged in a day or per child was not \nadding up. We need DHHS to define how many hours on the backend of its \nbilling system can be charged before a flag lets it know there is an issue. The \nDHHS either needs to communicate with the provider, or look at billing the \nprovider submits to ensure we do not have erroneous billing that continues to \npile up and create a backlog; DHCFP is making progress on that. \n \nThe Autism Treatment Assistance Program (ATAP) shall publish on its website \nspecific guidance on how to obtain a diagnosis and treatment, and maintain a \nlist of healthcare professionals qualified in performing the diagnosis of an autism \nspectrum disorder. The Audit was specific to the fact they struggled to find this \ninformation. Families need more resources to know what to do once they have a \ndiagnosis or how to get a qualified professional once they have a diagnosis.  \n \nThe Legislative Committee on Health Care shall receive from the DHCFP reports \non a number of different data. This is on page 17 of the Audit and page 61 of \nthe recommendations coming from the Audit. So much of the population getting \nservices are being handled through managed care organizations outside of the \nfee for service or where Medicaid can track them. On the backend system, the \nAudit found that the right data collection was not in place to understand what \nwas happening with this particular part of the population. We want DHCFP to \nreport on these items to the Legislative Committee on Health Care for greater \nunderstanding and transparency. We are a few months away from when DHCFP \ncan testify for this recommendation to be fully implemented from the Audit. \nOnce it is, the timing will be perfect as the Legislative Committee on Health \nCare begins in August.  \n \nWhen there is a waitlist for services, ATAP shall use risk assessment tools to \nassess and identify children with higher needs to ensure proper service delivery \nand triage to children who are the hardest to serve. Pages 25 and 26 of the \nAudit talk about the waitlist for children who are waiting for services. The wait \ntime is about 153 days before they get services; this is too long. We do not \nwant a waitlist, but in the meantime, we need a way for DHHS to assess \nchildren who need services immediately and get them into services quickly. The \nrisk assessment tools are being developed by ATAP, and we are hopeful they \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nwill  identify  those  children  who  simply  cannot  wait  and  promptly  get \nthem services. \n \nLastly, the ATAP program may add or unfreeze developmental specialists to \nallow them to fully implement Recommendation 10 from the Audit to supply \ncase managers. Page 66 of the Audit is the reference to this recommendation. \nThe families need staff who are designated to help guide them through the \nsystem when children get diagnosed. Unless we have that piece in place, we \nare not properly helping connect children with resources. We need that case \nmanagement piece for this to be an effective program. The positions are not \nbuilt  into  this  year's  budgets.  We  know  DHCFP  was  planning  for  them  in \nfour years.  This  Audit  puts  so  much  evidence  together,  we  cannot  wait \nfour years. If we can bring the staff on in this biennium, it makes sense to give \nthe time and effort to do this, and that is our goal. \n \nJULIE  OSTROVSKY  (Commissioner,  Nevada  Commission  on  Autism  Spectrum \nDisorders): \nWe support S.B. 96. It is the Commission's responsibility to monitor ATAP, \nMedicaid programs, early intervention services, as well as insurance, Medicaid \nrates and services for people with autism. I submitted a longer, more detailed \nwritten testimony (Exhibit I), but today I want to share a few key notes. We \nsupport this bill because of the large number of children on Medicaid who do \nnot  get  the  intervention  they  need  and  deserve.  We  also  recognize  the \nimportance of paying providers who serve the autism population. Businesses \ndeserve to make a sustainable wage to do business in Nevada. We have a \nproblem in our State. Children on Medicaid are unable to obtain ABA behavioral \nintervention services. \n \nIn Nevada, we have waitlists for children to be diagnosed and obtain services, \nand  painfully  low  Medicaid  rates  that  further  limit  access  to  life-changing \nservices. The Audit from January states that a shortage of ABA providers for \nchildren  with  Medicaid  coverage  is  worse  than  for  children  with  private \ninsurance since only about one-third of licensed ABA providers served Medicaid \nchildren in fiscal year 2020. If we ask providers today, the number would be \neven less. The Autism Legal Resource Center submitted charts (Exhibit J) that \nshow Nevada's low Medicaid reimbursement rate nationally and in the Western \nRegion. We are the lowest in the region. Delays in delivering services to children \nwith autism can have devastating consequences. The lack of Medicaid providers \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nworking with children in our State is unacceptable. A child can languish over a \nyear for a diagnosis and then is forced to wait for services equally as long. \n \nAmong the findings of the Audit is the $30.28 hourly rate paid by Medicaid is \nthe  same  rate  paid  by  ATAP  and  half  the  rate  private  insurers  pay.  Now \nMedicaid has been reduced by 6 percent retroactively as a result of A.B. No. 3 \nof  the  31st  Special  Session.  This  solidifies  our  standing  at  the  bottom  of \nMedicaid  reimbursements  across  the  Country.  This  rate  pays  for  services \nperformed by professional RBTs who are licensed, fingerprinted, trained, insured \nand more. This rate is well below the average $62 paid by insurance. The Audit \nconcludes that the rate disparity is a major barrier to these children receiving \nservices from our limited providers. Senate Bill 96 can help us solve the problem \nof access to services by increasing our Medicaid reimbursement rate to at least \n$48 per hour. \n \nWe have a chance this Session to do the right thing. We can fix this problem by \nincreasing our reimbursement rate to a competitive rate, thereby bringing in \nlocal providers and businesses from across the Country to provide services to \nour autism Medicaid population. This is not the first time we have asked for an \nincrease. We were here in 2015, 2017 and 2019. We did not get the rate \nincrease  but  this  informative,  helpful  Audit.  We  are  here  again  with  new \nsupporting documentation asking for the same increase. Parents are desperate \nand at a loss because no providers are available to help their children. We must \nimprove our access to services for children on Medicaid. Nevada is competing \nwith our neighboring states for talented, passionate, honest providers. \n \nAs of 11:00 a.m. this morning, there were 442 opinions in favor of S.B. 96. \nThe Legislative Audit makes it clear that it is good policy to increase the RBT \nrate and to address the barriers faced by children needing ABA services on \nMedicaid. We ask you to support and pass S.B. 96 out of this Committee so \ncosts can be further evaluated by the Senate Finance Committee. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIn  the  audit  process,  would  any  efficiencies  or  ways  from  some  of  the \nrecommendations free up resources that would put the State in a better position \nto invest in the rate structure? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN BENITEZ-THOMPSON: \nIn the Audit, we looked at the State expenditures and anticipated expenditures. \nPages 8 through 11 discuss expenditures related to this particular program. In \nthe  past  when  we  thought  about  the  costs  for  the  program,  DHCFP \noverestimated the number of children it anticipated would be served. There was \na big gap between projections and actual cases. The money being appropriated \ndid not always get used as quickly as it could have. Additional money being \nappropriated  did  not  end  up  where  we  hoped  it  would.  I  encourage  the \nCommittee to look at the numbers and charts with data from the past five years \non page 9 of the Audit. Good information in the Audit will help guide us to that \nbetter rate we can afford. \n \nSENATOR OHRENSCHALL: \nPage 20 of the Audit discusses S.B. No. 174 from the 80th Session and the \nfiscal note. Near the top of the page, I am quoting \"ATAP's waitlist caseload \nprojections  for  the  fiscal  note  appear  unreasonable  in  comparison  to  actual \n2020 numbers.\" There is some tightening up of those projections, which if more \naccurate  could  lead  to  more  children  getting  the  services  they  need. \nUnfortunately, they were not, according to this Audit. \n \nMS. BORTOLIN: \nIn past years, we put money into autism services that has gone in the wrong \nplace. It needs to be in this rate, which is what the Audit found. In the last \nbiennium, then-Governor Brian Sandoval put $42 million into autism services he \nbelieved would clear the waitlist, but because the rate was not changed, we did \nnot have enough providers for services. Tens of millions of those dollars went \nunspent and reverted back to the General Fund. This Audit proves the rate is the \nactual place that needs to be fixed. \n \nAs far as cost savings outside of this specific service, we are spending a lot of \nmoney as a State and community on this population because their needs are \ngoing unmet. It is important these children receive services at a young age \nimmediately, as soon as we can access them, and get a diagnosis to change \noutcomes. The later in life we connect them to those services, the harder it is to \nbe successful in that treatment. \n \nClark County's Eighth Judicial District has a Detention Alternative for Autistic \nYouth Court, a juvenile delinquency court with enough children to fill a specialty \ndocket. These children have autism that has manifested its behavioral issues \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nbecause they are unable to access services. It is great we have a legal system \nto rally around these children to get them the services they need; however, \ndoing it through the Judicial Branch is not appropriate or financially responsible. \nShifting the cost in this way will save us money across the board. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe never want to have a child on a waitlist in any situation. When that does \nhappen, the recommendation is to triage and identify which children should be \nat the top of the list. Are there tools? Are other states doing this? Do we have a \ngood  way  for  assessing  that?  Are  we  making  difficult  decisions,  ensuring \nchildren getting the services are those who need it most? \n \nASSEMBLYWOMAN BENITEZ-THOMPSON: \nThe Aging and Disability Services Division (ADSD) can speak to this more. Its \nwritten recommendation response in the Audit indicates the ADSD is working \non that tool and expects it to be used going forward. \n \nRIQUE  ROBB  (Deputy  Administrator,  Aging  and  Disability  Services  Division, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services): \nI will turn this over to the Program Manager, Samantha Jayme, and she will \nexplain what we have done to meet that specific requirement of the Audit in \nregard to the assessment. \n \nSAMANTHA  JAYME  (Health  Program  Manager,  Aging  and  Disability  Services \nDivision, Department of Health and Human Services): \nWe have piloted this tool and expect the quality assurance team to do our \nchecks and balances, and ensure it makes sense. We are getting the children \ntriaged appropriately. We are submitting our follow-up to the Audit, and we \nhope to fully implement the appropriate list as of May 1. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIf we increase the rate and intervene early, will that increase rates somewhere \nelse,  increase  the  waitlist  and  document  the  savings  to  which  Ms.  Bortolin \nalluded to offset the increased rate? Do we recognize the reality if we treat \nmore, it is going to cost more. It may cost less, but I am not sure it is going to \noffset later expenses as much as the investment. I do not want to go down the \nroad of pretending it will, if it will not. I am not opposed to proceeding, but I do \nnot want people disappointed that we may not save as much as the optimistic \nprojection.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWe will probably get a fiscal note for this bill that may address some of those \nissues, but the sponsor should speak to this. \n \nSENATOR OHRENSCHALL: \nThe  Audit  indicated  we  did  less  with  more  resources  that  were  not  spent \nappropriately. I am optimistic we can allot those resources as planned, and that \nit will lead to savings for the State. Children on Medicaid can get these services \nyounger and earlier. This has been one of the most thorough audits I have ever \nread,  and  the  recommendations  give  us  a  clear  path  of  how  to  fix  these \nproblems. I am optimistic it will lead to savings when we get those resources \nspent where they should be spent. \n \nCOMMISSIONER OSTROVSKY: \nI want to make clear that providers working with children who used Medicaid as \ntheir primary insurance are no longer taking Medicaid. These children are getting \nno intervention. It does not mean our State does not take care of them later in \nlife. We will be spending millions of dollars looking for group homes or trying to \ntake care of these children. Early intervention and access to that intervention is \nimportant, and we cannot offer that now. I know of four groups that dropped in \nDecember, and two of our largest providers that provide services nationwide no \nlonger take Medicaid in Nevada. We need to get the providers to get these \nchildren help. Early intervention means maybe they can learn to learn, go to \npublic school, lead productive lives and control dangerous behaviors so we do \nnot  need  an  autism  court.  That  is  where  this  becomes  key  and  incredibly \nimportant. \n \nSTEVEN COHEN: \nI support S.B. 96. \n \nYESENIA SERRATO GONZALES (Founder and Member, Azulblue United by Autism): \nI support S.B. 96. I come to you as an autistic mother of an amazing son who \nalso has autism. I have submitted my written testimony (Exhibit K). \n \nADAM HARRIS (Chief Operating Officer, Las Vegas Autism Center): \nWe support S.B. 96. We are a behavioral services agency in Las Vegas. We are \nhere to ensure eligible individuals with autism throughout the State gain access \nto services they have a right to by law. The main barrier to access is Medicaid \nfunding  for  ABA  therapy  does  not  support  the  growth  or  sustainability  for \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nbusinesses providing these services. We have supporting testimony (Exhibit L) \nand  financial  data  (Exhibit  M)  illustrating  rates  for  RBTs  and  BCBAs,  using \nmodels for four different rates. \n \nHAYLEY HUBER: \nI support S.B. 96. I am a mother of two children on the autism spectrum. I have \nsubmitted my written testimony (Exhibit N). \n \nLENISE KRYK, M.ED., BCBA, LBA (Director, The Lovass Center): \nWe support S.B. 96. I am proud of serving the autism community in Nevada for \nalmost 20 years. Last summer, I was appointed to the Nevada Commission on \nAutism Spectrum Disorders. I have provided written testimony (Exhibit O). \n  \nJANELLE SAUNDERS, BCBA, LBA: \nI support S.B. 96.  \n \nPAM BEREK: \nI support S.B. 96. I have a 19-year-old son with multiple disabilities, one of \nwhich was not diagnosed until later in his life. I have submitted my written \ntestimony and photographs (Exhibit P). \n \nJON PAUL SAUNDERS, M.Ed., BCBA, LBA: \nI support S.B. 96. I have provided written testimony (Exhibit Q). \n \nNANETTE EIDELBERG: \nI support S.B. 96. I thank Allen and Jan Crandy, former Chair of the Nevada \nCommission  on  Autism  Spectrum  Disorders,  who  advocated  for  autism \nprograms such as ATAP which helps improve the lives of children diagnosed \nwith autism, including my daughter. There was a time we did not know if she \nwould ever talk or be able to answer a question. My daughter is a 12-year-old, \nin the sixth grade, who was diagnosed with autism, labeled nonverbal, and had \nself-injurious behaviors. Nevada provided funding. From therapy through The \nLovass Center, she no longer throws tantrums but makes eye contact, reads, \nwrites, does math, is a model student in the classroom and has a better quality \nof life overall. \n \nWe could be in danger of losing our provider because of our low Medicaid rates. \nOur community has already lost providers and therapists, and puts children on \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \nlong waiting lists to receive ABA. Passing this bill gives our children a fighting \nchance of becoming self-sufficient and self-advocating adults. \n \nGWEN  DWIGGINS,  Ph.D.,  BCBA-D,  LBA  (Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Founder, \nAccelerated Learning Clinic): \nI  support  S.B.  96.  I  have  provided  services  for  over  25  years,  8 years  in \nNevada. I have submitted written testimony (Exhibit R). \n \nKENNETH  KILLINGSWORTH,  PH.D.,  BCBA  (Clinical  Director,  Helix  Behavioral \nServices): \nI  support  S.B.  96.  I  am  a  BCBA  who  owns  and  operates  Helix  Behavioral \nServices in Reno. I have submitted written testimony (Exhibit S). \n \nTERRA BASS: \nI  support  S.B.  96  and  have  submitted  written  testimony  (Exhibit  T).  After \ncountless  meetings  with  different  physicians,  I  was  told  my  two-year-old \ndaughter,  Quinn,  would  never  walk  without  assistance  and  would  need \nintensive  support.  She  was  diagnosed  with  Autism  Spectrum  Disorder  and \nstarted ABA. Applied behavior analysis helped her take her first steps, and she \nbegan running and making independent choices at three years old. Today, she is \nfour years old and finding her voice. Needless to say, she is defying the odds \nand making leaps and bounds through ABA. Quinn faces more challenges than \nmost children which is why this therapy is so crucial to her development. Early \ntreatment reduces the need for care later on in life. \n \nMy daughter and other autistic individuals should have the opportunity to reach \ntheir full potential just like everyone else. Medicaid rates do not allow my child \nto get the full support she needs. Due to this, she is falling further behind her \npeers  when  she  could  be  climbing.  Increasing  rates  for  ABA  will  increase \nqualified  providers,  allowing  greater  access  to  medically  necessary  services. \nThis bill is crucial to better the lives and meet the growing needs of autistic \nindividuals in Nevada. \n \nANDREW  MACKAY  (Executive  Director,  Nevada  Franchised  Auto  Dealers \nAssociation): \nWe support S.B. 96. This issue is near and dear to many of our members' \nhearts who dug deep in their pockets to support treatment of autism spectrum \ndisorders. This bill will allow more providers to accept Medicaid contracts, and \nmost importantly, increase access to services for children.  \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \nDESIRAE WINGERTER, BCBA: \nI am in support of S.B. 96. I am testifying as an advocate for those individuals \nwith  different  abilities  and  the  professionals  who  serve  them.  I  am  also  a \nrepresentative of Collaboration Center Foundation. I share my support for the \ncritical passage of this bill. At its current reimbursement rate, the lowest in the \nNation, the majority of ABA providers cannot sustain their businesses, and this \ntrickle-down effect results in increased waitlists, RBT turnover, lost jobs and, \nmost importantly, individuals with autism not receiving the services they need \nand  deserve.  It  is  time  for  Nevada  to  fully  support  our  most  vulnerable \npopulation. \n \nMARIA LOPEZ: \nI  support  S.B.  96.  I  am  a  parent  of  two  children  with  autism.  My  son  is \nnonverbal. My biggest fear is not having the ABA services we acquired when he \nwas  a  three-year-old.  I  cannot  express  the  pain  a  parent  suffers  when  you \nwatch  your  child  go  through  such  extreme,  violent  behavior  such  as  biting \nhimself and banging his head on hard surfaces. These are definite behaviors that \nneed  professional  care  and  support,  and  that  is  ABA.  There  was  testimony \nearlier that a child with similar behaviors did not receive early ABA. We would \nbe the alternative case. Since acquiring our ABA, we have not seen any of \nthose violent, self-harming behaviors. This life-saving and life-changing therapy \ntransforms children and increases their abilities. They have hope, and it gives a \nchance for families who have ABA services. I plead with you to pass this bill. \n \nALDEN GRANT: \nI support S.B. 96. At 26 months, I was diagnosed with severe autism, but \nthanks  to  an  early  and  intensive  ABA  treatment  program,  I  am  now  a \nfunctioning adult able to do normal things. \n \nJACQUELYN NADER: \nWe support S.B. 96. I am here to testify on behalf of Ellen Whittemore and \nsubmit a support statement from Chase Whittemore (Exhibit U), who could not \nbe here tonight. Some of you may know her as the Executive Vice President and \nGeneral Counsel for Wynn Resorts. Some of you may also know her for her \nparticipation and leadership as a board member for the Grant a Gift Autism \nFoundation, an organization that provides assessment and treatment funding for \nchildren, young adults and their families. Ellen's grandson has autism and has \ngreatly benefited from ABA. He has gone from completely nonverbal to now \npreparing for kindergarten this fall. The Whittemores are grateful and thankful \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \nfor  the  private  insurance  that  has  paid  for  his  extensive  treatment.  This \nimportant bill will allow children who are underinsured to receive the treatment \nthat has been so beneficial to Ellen's grandson. \n \nMICHELE TOMBARI: \nI support S.B. 96. I know that as a parent of a recovered child of autism, ABA \ntreatment needs to be accessible for all children in Nevada. I have submitted my \nwritten testimony (Exhibit V). \n \nSTELLA MONTILLO: \nI support S.B. 96. I am a mother of three children with autism. I used to live in \nMiami but moved to Nevada three years ago with the sole purpose of helping \nmy children because in Miami, there is not a lot of help for children with autism. \nI have provided my written testimony (Exhibit W). \n \nSARA MOORE, BCBA, LBA: \nI  support  S.B.  96.  I  have  a  family  member  who  came  to  Nevada  and  was \ndiagnosed  with  autism.  He  remained  on  a  waitlist  for  ABA  services  for \nfour years. Families should not have to wait that long for services in Nevada. \n \nSARAH ALSHAIKH: \nI support S.B. 96. I am a mental health therapist and mother to a three-year-old \nboy who has a rare genetic disorder and moderate autism. My hope is that with \nan increase in reimbursement rates, more providers will accept Medicaid. My \nfamily  is  fortunate  to  have  private  insurance,  but  those  with  only  Medicaid \nstruggle with waiting for a year or more on waitlists. Applied behavior analysis \ncan be the foundation for a myriad of skills. Many young children struggle with \neye contact, a critical skill that needs to develop early for social abilities and \nspeech. When a child is engaged in interacting, social cognitive skills increase. \nSocial cognitive skills in children can not only be the ability to learn but the \nability to adopt the perspective of others and engage in prosocial behaviors like \nempathy and cooperation. Eye contact is the foundation for a child to become a \nproductive member of society. Applied behavior analysis helps with that, and a \nchild should not have to wait a year or more for this kind of help. If more \nproviders accept Medicaid, more children will receive treatment. \n \nJENNIFER THOMAS, BCBA, LBA: \nI support S.B. 96. I work as a behavioral analyst in Fallon and serve an area of \nover 50,000 square miles. I travel from Gerlach to Tonopah and Dayton to \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 27 \n \nLovelock. Due to the rural population I see, over 90 percent of my clients are on \nMedicaid and, unfortunately, are not getting enough high quality services. This \nis because I cannot recruit or retain RBTs in the rural areas due primarily to \nreimbursement rates that are too low to compete with business locales such as \nTesla and others that offer higher pay than our reimbursement. \n \nThis is what we are offering families who have nowhere else to turn and need \nservices for their children. As a BCBA, Medicaid will give me six hours per \nweek, maximum, for one-on-one work with these clients. If I was to find RBTs, \nthese clients would get at least 30 hours per week, depending on their severity \nand treatment plans. I encourage you to think about the families in the rural \nareas, who do not have the ability to travel to large metropolitan areas such as \nLas Vegas or Reno, and ensure they can get the much-needed access to their \nservices. \n \nMICHELLE CANNING, BCBA, LBA (Owner, Crossroads Behavior Consultation): \nI support S.B. 96. I am requesting your support and sponsorship of this bill to \nincrease the Medicaid reimbursement rate for ABA service. I have submitted my \nwritten testimony (Exhibit X). \n \nCHRIS HOLCOMB, PH.D., BCBA-D: \nI support S.B. 96. I have been training behavior analysts for 20 years as well as \nspeech  language  pathologists.  Over  the  past  year,  we  trained  over \nten individuals as BCBAs, and half of them have left the State. We need to \nincrease the rates we pay these analysts, not only to keep them in Nevada but \nalso to attract new BCBAs to the State to help children who are in dire need of \nservices. We receive nearly ten calls per day from families looking for services \nthat we cannot provide due to the rates. Our average rate is $25 per hour, and \nwe range from $23 to $27 per hour. Please pass S.B. 96. \n \nDANNENE DRUMMOND, BCBA, LBA (Owner, Snowflakes ABA, LLC): \nI support S.B. 96. I am in the unique position of being a mother to a 19-year-old \nson with autism who is receiving Nevada Medicaid benefits, and I own an ABA \ncompany in Maryland. I have submitted my written testimony (Exhibit Y). \n \nSENATOR OHRENSCHALL: \nI have seen one of the callers, Alden Grant, grow up and how much the ABA \ntherapy has helped him. I saw him earn his Eagle Scout badge and become a \nsuccessful young adult. That is the kind of difference ABA therapy can make. If \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 28 \n \nthe  bill  does  move  forward  I  ask  the  Committee  to  consider  one  additional \namendment  to  add  Assemblywoman  Teresa  Benitez-Thompson  as  a  primary \nsponsor. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAre you anticipating any other amendments? \n \nSENATOR OHRENSCHALL: \nNo. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 96. I will open the hearing on S.B. 326. \n \nSENATE  BILL  326:  Revises  provisions  relating  to  providers  of  health  care. \n(BDR 54-614) \n \nSENATOR JOSEPH P. HARDY (Senatorial District No. 12): \nSenate Bill 326 is about telehealth. On April 1, 2020, the Governor declared a \nDeclaration  of  Emergency  Directive  11  due  to  the  Covid-19  pandemic.  The \nfocus  was  to  register  providers  from  other  states  to  come  to  Nevada  via \ntelehealth and take care of people who live in Nevada. Directive 11 waived \nlicensing requirements, including requirements relating to telehealth, for skilled \nmedical professionals. Out-of-state providers would register with the Board of \nMedical Examiners or other boards without a fee and perform telehealth from \ntheir location in another state or territory.  \n \nSection 8 starts with electronic forms to apply for the issuance or renewal of \nlicensing. The forms must not contain any language that could be interpreted to \ndiscourage or threaten applicants from applying for licensure. The forms must \ninclude a statement welcoming the applicant to this State. Section 9 mirrors the \nState Board of Osteopathic Medicine with the Board of Medical Examiners that \nlicenses  allopathic  professionals  so  NRS  633  mirrors  NRS  630.  We  also \nrecognize  people  who  are  applying  for  networks  with  insurance  carriers  to \npractice in Nevada. A form on the internet that physicians who are applying can \nfill out will advise acceptance or denial, and the reason why, which would be \nconfidential. One of the problems some may have is concerns if the applicant \nlied,  we  can  revoke  that  registration  because  he  or  she  is  not  licensed  in \nNevada. That, in essence, is the bill. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 29 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nSection 4, subsection 3 states \"Registration issued pursuant to this section \nexpires 1 year after the date of issuance and is not renewable.\" Can they only \ndo this once and for a year? \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe theory is yes. If they are not going to come to Nevada, then we are done \nbecause we need them here. If they want to come here, they will apply and be \nlicensed. This registration is one and done as opposed to a license. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWill they be able to get their licenses within a year? \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThey may apply any time during that year. I am optimistic that if they want to \ncome, they can start that license procedure any time they want. They do not \nhave to wait until their registration runs out. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nIf they start the very first day, are we confident that on the 365th day they will \nhave a license in hand? \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe Board of Medical Examiners is hearing us as we speak, and it is motivated \nto act more expeditiously with an online application so the form does not go \nback and forth repeatedly. I am optimistic they will to do that within a year. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWhat happens if the Board does not? \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe  applicant  loses  the  registration  but  can  still  participate  in  the  license \napplication, however long that takes. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nDoes anything in the bill allow those who go through the registration process to \ngo  through  an  abbreviated  licensing  process  given  we  do  not  have  all  the \ninformation  but  a  good  amount  of  it?  Would  they  have  to  go  through  the \nlicensing process as if we have never seen them before? \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 30 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThey would have to go through the licensing process. This does not preclude \nanything, it just makes it easier to apply. When they are coming from another \nstate and duly licensed with a clean record, then they already have done much \nof the work that puts them in a position to go through the licensing process. \nThese doctors also have the opportunity to look at the endorsement process and \nthrough  the  Federation  of  State  Medical  Boards,  they  will  have  some  other \ntools. For instance, the Air Force doctor I spoke with was quickly registered and \nlicensed in Nevada because these organizations are the ones that keep all the \nrecords and can get them to the Board of Medical Examiners quickly. When we \nstart talking to these doctors, I recommend we give them those hints of what \nthey can do to facilitate coming to Nevada on a permanent basis. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nAre other states doing something like this? \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWe heard from New York, which put a plea out for doctors and nurses to come \nto their state, and people went there. I am not sure of the exact process, but \nthey did not have time to apply for full licensure. Other states have opened their \nborders for opportunities to practice, but I do not know if any of them have \ndone it as quickly, wherein doctors are using the broad stroke, as Governor \nSteve Sisolak did for us. He literally opened doors to get doctors involved, and \nabout 1,400 doctors applied for the waiver. I do not know yet how many took \nadvantage of the telehealth registration, but it has become a place where we \ncan recruit. \n \nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \nHow will this work when Nevada becomes a member of the Interstate Medical \nLicensure Compact? \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nNevada is already a member. It will make it easier for anyone to come, whether \nthey have the registration or not. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nHow many different provider types would fall under this bill? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 31 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIn the Board of Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine, \nyou have physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, perfusionists and \nrespiratory  therapists.  The  Governor  also  opened  it  up  for  behavioral  health \noccupations. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe bill says it is any provider of health care, it is not limited to physicians. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe Governor did a pretty broad stroke. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nSome  restrictions  in  the  registration  process  exclude  individuals  with  any \ndisciplinary measures levied against them and those held civilly or criminally \nliable for malpractice. Do you expect the Boards to investigate if any of that is \ntrue or is it just a statement of affirmation in the application and registration \nprocesses? \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIt is an affirmation. The difference is if our Board wanted to make one call to \ntheir board, it would be different than sending off for copies of their original \nclinical education rotations from the third and fourth year of medical school, \ninternship and on and on. Our Board can pick up the phone and ask about any \nadverse actions against that doctor. That would be one phone call instead of \nmany sheets of paper, copies and faxes going back and forth. A totally different \nsystem would take place when the doctor applies for a real license. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nDoes anything indicate people who want to practice remotely into Nevada via \ntelehealth would be interested in relocating? \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nI am optimistic that may happen; if there is one provider, there may be more. \nAmong people who are in Idaho, Elko and border towns, someone is going to \nsay \"Why do I want to live in another state when I can live in Nevada.\" \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 32 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nTo follow up on Senator Kieckhefer's question and the border town concept, I \nam stuck on the one year. From a patient's perspective, if you are in one of \nthose border towns and it is helpful for you to have this as a patient, you have \ncreated a behavioral health relationship with a provider on telehealth for a year. \nThen that provider decides to not move to Nevada. Why would we want to \nsuspend that relationship? \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWe do not want to suspend that relationship. I am basing this on the Governor's \nemergency directive. If that emergency directive could be amended into this bill, \nI am amenable to that because he ends up with the bill anyway, and it could be \ndone. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe  emergency  directive  ends  at  some  point.  If  your  answer  is  you  are \namending it into this bill, then this ends at some point. Is this bill a reaction to \nan emergency? I am still struggling with why there is a one-year limit. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe Governor's directive was one year, and that is where it came from. If we \nwanted to do something else and go through the legislative process to change \nthat kind of opportunity, we could do that. I suspect he would be amenable. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWhen is the bill effective? \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nIt is in the language of the bill. If not spelled out, it is October. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nPage 11 says it is upon passage for the approval of adopting any regulations \nand January 1, 2022, for anything else. This will buy us one year's worth of \ntelehealth  professionals.  Why  is  it  necessary  to  have  the  bill  require  no \nthreatening language? \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe State is at the bottom of the number of physicians. The Board of Medical \nExaminer's licensing application has negative language. We wanted to avoid \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 33 \n \nthat so we took more positive words from Arizona and Utah's applications and \nput that language in the bill because we want to invite people as opposed to \nscare people. No matter who it is, we are going to investigate them and make \nsure they qualify. I have a problem with negative versus positive language. \n \nDAVID DAZLICH (Southern Nevada Forum on Health Care): \nWe  support  S.B.  326.  It  is  a  priority  to  increase  access  to  telehealth  by \nstreamlining the licensing process for doctors within Nevada.  \n \nKEITH LEE (Board of Medical Examiners): \nWe are neutral for S.B. 326. The Board has filed a fiscal note with a detailed \nexplanation.  The  Board  has  several  questions  regarding  this  bill.  I  have \nsubmitted my written testimony (Exhibit Z). \n \nSUSAN FISHER (State Board of Osteopathic Medicine): \nWe are neutral for S.B. 326. We agree with the comments made by Mr. Lee on \nbehalf  of  the  Board  of  Medical  Examiners;  however,  we  have  a  few  other \npoints.  This  is  not  streamlining  the  licensing  process,  it  is  the  registration \nprocess. It is a free registration. We will still have to do the same background \nchecks and have staff time to call other states; those costs go on the backs of \nother licensees. We are a fee-based organization and receive no General Funds. \nIt is going to cost dollars to do this. We will have a fiscal note as well. \n \nThere  are  24  states  that  are  members  of  the  Interstate  Medical  Licensure \nCompact,  of  which  Nevada  is  a  member.  We  are  already  streamlined  for \nlicensing. Our Board meets monthly to review license applications quickly, and \nour process is online. We are charged with protecting the public and making \nsure the person is qualified to practice in Nevada and take care of Nevadans. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nCould our Legal Counsel speak to the caller's question about the remedy if \nregistration information is false? \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nSection 4, subsection 4, paragraph (c), states: \n \nA regulatory body may revoke a registration issued pursuant to this \nsection  or  impose  other  disciplinary  action  against  a  registrant \nunder the same circumstances and in accordance with the same \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 34 \n \nprocedure as applies to a person who is licensed or certified in this \nState.  \n \nWhatever the Board of Medical Examiners can do to a licensee who was found \nto have submitted false information, the Board can do to a registrant. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDoes anything in this bill either allow or prohibit the boards subject to this bill to \nwrite regulations that would address the other questions about fingerprints and \nverification? \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nSection 4, subsection 2, paragraphs (b) and (c) state: \"A regulatory body shall \nissue  a  registration  pursuant  to  subsection  1  upon  the  application  of  an \napplicant who: has not been disciplined or investigated by the corresponding \nregulatory  authority\"  and  \"has  not  been  held  civilly  or  criminally  liable  for \nmalpractice.\" They could potentially conduct a background check for the limited \npurpose of determining whether the applicant has been held criminally liable for \nmalpractice. Beyond that, they could not deny registration for any other reason \nnot specifically stated in section 4, subsection 2 of the bill. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI would appreciate understanding the broader group of healthcare professionals \nif you could provide us with a list of which professionals this applies to and \nwhich boards provide the licensing for those professionals. I understand the \ninclination to make the registration process free, but I am concerned about the \nsmaller boards. It sounds like we will have some fiscal notes coming forward. \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nThe  list  includes  any  provider  of  health  care  as  defined  in  NRS  629.031: \nphysician; physician's assistant; dentist; nurse; emergency medical personnel; \ndispensing  optician;  optometrist;  speech-language  pathologist;  audiologist; \npractitioner  of  respiratory  care;  physical  therapist;  occupational  therapist; \npodiatrist;  psychologist;  marriage  and  family  counselor;  clinical  professional \ncounselor;  music  therapist;  chiropractor;  athletic  trainer;  doctor  of  oriental \nmedicine;  medical  laboratory  director  or  technician;  pharmacist;  licensed \ndietician;  social  worker;  alcohol  and  drug  counselor;  and  problem  gambling \ncounselor. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 35 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nSection 3 refers to NRS 629.510 and NRS 629.515 which deal with telehealth. \nThese may be different than some of the other ones; however, I do not know \nwhich ones are not allowed to telehealth. Section 4, subsection 1, states the \ntelehealth provider has to be licensed or certified in another state, District of \nColumbia, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or a territory under the jurisdiction of \nthe U.S. Section 4, subsection 4, paragraph (c) may revoke the registration. It is \nmore stringent in its ability to do something of a negative consequence. \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nI would like to make one clarification. When I listed the providers of health care, \nthat  is  for  the  telehealth  registration.  If  they  cannot  provide  services  by \ntelehealth, the electronic registration only applies to the medical examiners and \nosteopathic medical examiners. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nMr. Robbins, I would appreciate if you could help us with a list of who can do \ntelehealth so we could get a handle on which boards this would impact. \n \nMR. ROBBINS: \nYes, I will. \n \n \nRemainder of page intentionally left blank; signature page to follow.   \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 25, 2021 \nPage 36 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 326.

(BDR 40-955) \n \nSENATOR FABIAN DONATE (Senatorial District No. 10): \nI will read from my written remarks (Exhibit B). \n \nOLIVIA WHITELEY (Refugee Advocacy Lab): \nI will read from my written testimony (Exhibit C) as I review the presentation \n(Exhibit  D)  from  the  Refugee  Advocacy  Lab.  Also,  for  your  review,  are  the \nproposed amendment to S.B. 318 (Exhibit E), the Language Access Assessment \nand Planning Tool (Exhibit F) and the Department of Health and Human Services \nLanguage Access Policies (Exhibit G). \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe requirements of S.B 318 are for any and all languages. Are there thresholds \nfor the top ten languages spoken? I am wondering about the workload for the \nState  agencies  and  getting  this  done  if  we  are  targeting  the  pandemic  and \nemergency declarations in the first few sections of the bill. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 4 \n \nSENATOR DONATE: \nThe intention of S.B 318 is whatever is reasonable to help us navigate the \nCovid-19  pandemic.  There  are  many  languages  around  the  world  and  many \nspoken in Nevada. As we start to vaccinate more people, it will be harder to \nreach those who do not want to be vaccinated or are on the verge of deciding \nthis is what is best for them. For us to provide accurate information to those \nindividuals,  this  needs  to  be  done  in  a  manner  that  respects  their  native \nlanguage. \n \nMS. WHITELEY: \nAny requirement that an agency determines they must serve an individual with \nlimited English proficiency (LEP) is proportionate to the language of the clients \nthey serve. That determination begins with the agencies gathering data through \nthe Covid-19 language access plan provisions on what the languages are of the \nindividuals they serve. There is not a blanket mandate that all agencies must \nserve all languages, it is dependent on the needs of the clients of each individual \nagency. \n \nThe amended version of the bill sets the standard to be that an agency must \ntake reasonable steps to ensure meaningful access. That is a flexible standard \nthat agencies must follow and is consistent with what is required in federal law. \n \nThe Covid-19 provisions are dependent upon appropriation of federal funds. The \nreasonable  steps  an  agency  would  take  would  also  be  dependent  on  what \nfederal funding is allocated for these particular activities. Similarly, that would \nbe true with the language access plan provisions. The implementation questions \nof  those  plans  and  policies  will  not  be  discussed  until  the  2023 Legislative \nSession. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nDoes  section  8  of  the  bill  kick  in  two  years  after  the  termination  of  the \nGovernor’s Emergency Directive? \n \nMS. WHITELEY: \nSection  8  only  removes  the  requirement  that  revisions  of  agency  language \naccess plans must include an evaluation of how the agency addresses language \naccess needs during Covid-19. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 5 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nFor the first two years following the Governor’s termination of his Emergency \nDirective, the agencies are required to do a retrospective look at how they \nperformed during the pandemic, correct? \n \nMS. WHITELEY: \nThat is correct. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nWhen the bill references the Division, it says this is an unfunded mandate on the \nlocal governments, not the State, so the local governments are going to be held \naccountable. Which Division are we looking at? \n \nMS. WHITELEY: \nSection 2 of the bill requires the Division of Public and Behavioral Health to \nimplement the Covid-19 related provisions. Sections 3 and 4 require local health \ndistricts or departments to implement those provisions. \n \nIn the proposed amendment, Exhibit E, section 3, subsection 6, and section 4, \nsubsection 6 state “This shall be implemented to the extent that funding is \navailable”. The intent is that those provisions only become operative if monies \nfrom the American Rescue Plan are allocated for these purposes. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nSo this does include the State as well as the Health District of the largest \ncounty. \n \nMS. WHITELEY: \nYes, it does. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe  Additional  Provision  portion  at  the  top  of  the  proposed  amendment, \nExhibit E, is not incorporated into one of the sections of the bill. What is the \nintent of that section? The statement, “State assisted programs” meaning all \nprograms that receive state funding is a lot. Is this specifically related to public \nhealth or does it include everything the State does? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 6 \n \nSENATOR DONATE: \nThe  intent  of  the  bill  is  divided  into  two  parts.  The  first  part  is  Covid-19 \noriented, and the second part is to revise the services we provide as a State and \nany needs and gaps. Also, to look at those gaps, see what we can improve, use \nthese two years to identify what the gaps are, and in a future session, and if \nrequests are warranted, make allocations to solve those disparities. \n \nMS. WHITELEY: \nThe  intent  of  the  additional  general  provision  is  to  provide  local  districts \nadditional  flexibility  in  implementation  of  the  Covid-19  provisions  and  give \nagencies  the  flexibility  in  the  implementation  of  the  language  access  plan \nprovisions. The standard to make reasonable effort, or to take reasonable steps \nto provide meaningful access, is the standard we are looking toward in order to \nallow agencies that flexibility. \n \nIn terms of the definitions of State assisted programs, this is modeled after the \nexisting federal requirement that any federally conducted or federally assisted \nprograms are required to assure language access from any subcontractors or \ngrantees. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIs this the language you have inserted into the different sections, or is it stand \nalone as a piece of the statute? \n \nMS. WHITELEY: \nIt is drafted to do both. First, as an additional general standard set for the \nagencies both in terms of the language access plan and Covid-19 provision. \nSecond, it is to be integrated throughout the language of the bill. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nTo Senator Kieckhefer’s point, will this apply to all State agencies that receive \nState funding? \n \nMS. WHITELEY: \nThe Covid-19 provisions will only apply to the Division of Public and Behavioral \nHealth and the local county health districts or departments. The requirement to \ndraft, not to implement, a language access plan will apply to all State agencies. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 7 \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nCan you delineate which sections of the bill do or do not relate to Covid-19? \n \nMS. WHITELEY: \nSections  2,  3  and  4  are  Covid-19  related  and  section  7  is  related  to  the \nlanguage access plan drafting requirement. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nThe State assisted programs are only in sections 2, 3 and 4 for Covid-19? \n \nMS. WHITELEY: \nThe  State  assisted  requirement  would  fall  under  section  7  which  requires \nagencies to develop the language access plan. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nDoes the sentence relating to the language access plan drafting requirement \nbelong to section 7 of the bill? \n \nMS. WHITELEY: \nYes. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nCan you give an example of a state that has a good language access plan? \n \nMS. WHITELEY: \nThere are states that have introduced similar legislation as well as the Division \nof Child and Family Services. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIs this the exhibit on the legislative website, Exhibit G, from the Department of \nHealth and Human Services (DHHS)? \n \nMS. WHITELEY: \nYes. Pages 1 and 6 of the presentation set out the two policies from Division of \nChild and Family Services we think are the most developed and reflect the \ndirection of what we would like to see through this piece of legislation. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 8 \n \nMANUEL MEDEROS: \nAs the Language Access Specialist for the Northern Nevada International Center \nin Reno, I support S.B. 318 because it is critical that each Nevada agency is \nable to create their own language access plan. This plan will help State agencies \nmeet  the  language  needs  of  Nevadans  experiencing  significant  barriers  to \naccessing State services related to Covid-19 due to the lack of materials and \ninformation translated. \n \nThe  Covid-19  pandemic  has  disrupted  nearly  every  aspect  of  our  lives  and \nreached into almost every community in our  State. The ability to keep one \nanother safe and healthy depends on every Nevadan having access to credible \ninformation about how to prevent the spread of Covid-19, the types of support \nand services available, and how to comply with federal, State and local orders. \n \nWe know certain communities are disproportionally impacted by this pandemic. \nOne way we can shift that is by meeting our obligations to communicate in \nways acceptable, culturally and linguistically relevant. \n \nThe  Language  Bank  at  The  Northern  Nevada  International  Center  provides \n20 languages in person, 200 languages over the phone, and over 15 languages \nincluding American sign-language over video remote interpreting technology and \ndocumentation and translation in over 100 languages. All of these languages \nserve as just one example of the resources our State needs to stay culturally \nrelevant. Many State agencies do not have access to the diverse services the \nlanguage bank provides. Only Statewide planning and resources can expand \nlanguage access for all equitably. \n \nCovid-19 took my father’s life a few months ago. Many times, my father asked \nme to interpret for him as not all the doctors and nurses understood him and \nwere not able to communicate with him in his own language. We need S.B. 318 \nto ensure hundreds of communities can access life-saving information and care. \n \nDEBORAH SILVERA (Nevada Interpreters & Translators Association): \nThe  Nevada  Interpreters  &  Translators  Association  supports  S.B. 318.  As \nlanguage  access  professionals,  we  are  intimately  aware  of  the  need  for \nNevadans  with  LEP  to  have  access  to  all  information  regarding  government \nservices. This must include access to trained and qualified interpretation and \ntranslation  services  necessary  for  Nevadans  to  receive  accurate  and  vital \ninformation regarding government services. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 9 \n \nThe  use  of  machine  translation  aids  such  as  Google  Translate  can  lead  to \nunwanted  errors  in  conveying  the  intended  message.  This  can  range  from \ncomical to dangerous and serious communication. \n \nLikewise, the use of untrained bilingual persons to interpret for family members, \noften  minor  children,  is  not  only  dangerous  but  ethically  unsound. \nSenate Bill 318 supports this objective by requiring agencies to outline accurate \ncredentialing and oversight of translators as in additional requirements, training, \nincentive and recruiting initiatives to support interpreters and translators. \n \nTrained  and  qualified  language  access  services  are  more  critical  during  the \nCovid-19  crisis  where  a  lack  of  accurate  information  can  not  only  lead  to \nunwanted individual health consequences, but can have a catastrophic effect on \nthe community at large. All aspects of the public health effort to deal with \nCovid-19  require  an  informed  public  which  ranges  from  testing  to  masking, \nimmunizations and contract tracing. Senate Bill 318 requirements for additional \nCovid-19  language  resources  will  help  ensure  all  Nevadans  receive  accurate \ninformation about Covid-19 and will build trust between a populous that is often \nsuspicious of public health agencies and have suffered disproportionately from \nthe effects of the pandemic. \n \nCHLOE HSIA (Asian Community Development Council): \nThe  Asian  Community  Development  Council  supports  S.B. 318.  We  are  a \ncommunity  organization  serving  the  fastest  growing  community  in  Nevada, \nproviding  the  community  with  critical  resources  and  services  including  open \nenrollment navigators and our food bank, among others. Language access is a \ncrucial  part  of  our  work,  and  we  see  personally  the  gap  that  exists  in \ncommunicating critical public health information to the community. \n \nDuring  this  time  last  year,  we  translated  Covid-19  response  materials  in \nTagalog, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese and Thai. There is a lot of misinformation \non messaging sites, and providing expanded language access for everyone helps \nwith health equity. \n \nBUSHRA DOS SANTOS (Catholic Charities of Southern Nevada): \nThe Catholic Charities of Southern Nevada support S.B. 318. We are recognized \nas the State office for refugees. Through this program, we resettle hundreds of \nrefugees each year from around the world who have fled their homes due to \nwar  and  persecution.  In  2020,  we  served  over  1,200  refugee  clients.  Our \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 10 \n \nclients  speak  many  languages  including  Arabic,  Farsi,  Dari,  Swahili, \nKinyerwanda and many others. Although our office provides robust services and \nadequate interpretation to our refugee clients, S.B. 318 is vital in ensuring all \nrefugees  and  LEP  individuals  can  access  essential  services  across  all \ngovernment agencies. \n \nThe Covid-19 pandemic has amplified many challenges our refugees have in \naccessing these essential services. With a lack of adequate interpretation and \nlimited  office  availability  of  government  services  due  to  the  pandemic,  our \nrefugees have struggled with filing unemployment claims after being laid off, \nobtaining social security cards and applying for public assistance. In addition, \nthe lack of Covid-19 information available in the languages our refugee clients \nspeak, make it difficult to have equitable access to the same information their \nEnglish speaking counterparts have, barring them from accessing appropriate \ncare. \n \nStatewide planning and resources are necessary to enhance language access for \nnot only our refugee clients but all residents equitably. Senate Bill 318 is the \nfirst step in the process of identifying where the gaps in language services are \nand how they can be addressed to meet the growing needs of our population \nthat is becoming increasingly diverse. \n \nGILLIAN BLOCK (Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers): \nThe Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers supports S.B. 318. The legal \naid providers in Nevada frequently serve with LEP, and generally identifying and \naddressing language access gaps is extremely important. Language barriers that \nalready  exist  have  become  even  steeper  since  the  onset  of  the  pandemic. \nCovid-19 has made it clear that many areas for language access are critical. The \nhealth information necessary for people to keep themselves and their families \nsafe and prevent community spread has been rapidly evolving. \n \nAll Nevadans, regardless of language or national origins, should be able to learn \nabout and access this information and the vital services for which they are \neligible.  Improving  language  access  to  people  seeking  health  information, \nunderstanding public health recommendations, accessing testing, treatment and \nvaccine information is extremely important. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 11 \n \nBRADLEY MAYER (Southern Nevada Health District): \nThe Southern Nevada Health District is neutral on S.B. 318. We had expressed \nconcerns with how the bill was originally drafted. The proposed amendment, \nExhibit E, is more permissive and is contingent upon funding being available to \nexecute these new responsibilities. We will work with the sponsor to ensure the \nlanguage does not create an unfunded mandate should the funding fluctuate or \nnot be permanent. \n \nJOELLE GUTMAN DODSON (Washoe County Health District): \nThe  Washoe  County  Health  District  is  neutral  on  S.B. 318,  and  I  echo  the \ncomments from Mr. Mayer with the Southern Nevada Health District. \n \nSENATOR DONATE: \nI will read from my closing comments, Exhibit B. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 318 and open the hearing on S.B. 340. \n \nSENATE  BILL  340:  Revises  provision  relating  to  the  wages  and  working \nconditions of certain employees. (BDR 53-573) \n \nSENATOR DINA NEAL (Senatorial District No. 4): \nThe story of the home health care worker is compelling. A home health care \nworker took care of my father and was responsible for bathing him and placing \nhim in his pajamas. I was brought into a world where I understood the life of the \nsick  and  the  elderly.  We  were  in  a  different  position  than  most  when  we \ncontracted for services. Because of the pandemic, my daughter and I worked \nvirtually,  so  we  were  not  faced  with  having  to  physically  be  at  work  and \nmanage the care of a loved one. This is the reality for other families who do not \nhave the capacity to work remotely. \n \nThese home health care workers matter because they have become a part of a \ntiny  society  that  forms  when  people  exist  under  one  roof.  Our  ingress  and \negress revolves around the sick, and it is important these workers receive the \nproper training, transportation, reimbursement and other things listed in the bill. \nTaking care of the sick is something you will never imagine until you experience \nit and have to contract for services for an individual to come into your home \nthat  will  allow  you  the  two  or  four  hours  a  day  you  need  to  pick  up  a \nprescription or simply eat. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 12 \n \nOur focus was on one person. The two hours we contracted for a home health \ncare worker allowed us the time to schedule doctors’ appointments and the time \nto take care of the duties that worker could not do. \n \nFor the sick and elderly, the medicine reminders we think about today must \nremain  on  a  schedule,  and  this  medication  cannot  be  missed;  it  must  be \nconsistent. Our home health care worker was integral in helping us remember \nwhen  those  medications  were  needed  and  at  what  time  they  were  to  be \nadministered. \n \nGRACE  VERGARA-MACTAL,  (Executive Director,  Service  Employees  International \nUnion): \nI will read from my written testimony (Exhibit H) in support of S.B. 340. \n \nVANESSA TORTI (Senior Home Care Coordinator, Service Employees International \nUnion): \nI will read from my written testimony (Exhibit I) in support of S.B. 340 and the \nproposed amendment (Exhibit J). \n \nFARREN EPSTEIN: \nI will read from my written testimony (Exhibit K) in support of S.B. 340. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe State is one of the  more significant payers  of personal care assistants \nthrough our Medicaid and Home and Community Based Care waiver programs. \nWhat is interesting about S.B 340 is that everything is required by the Director \nof DHHS to perform investigations and make recommendations on pay. That \nsame individual needs to be conscientious about the State’s budget. It seems \nthat whoever is put in charge will be in a position of being the steward of the \npersonal care assistants in their professional situation. At the same time, they \nwill be the steward of the budget that might be the cause for the personal care \nassistant situation not being the best. Is it intentional that everyone engaged in \ndecisions is at the same table, or do you see any challenges in terms of the \nstructure? \n \nMS. TORTI: \nIn recognizing the tension of the situation, the unique thing we are trying to do \nis bring in voices that historically have not had a seat at the policy table. They \nneed  to  bring  the  perspective  of  the  employers  of  the  caregivers  and  the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 13 \n \nconsumers who have not been able to have an equal footing in speaking to the \nstructure of the Medicaid programs. It is particularly the people on the front line \nwho are doing the work and are getting these services every day that know \nmore about what needs to be done to fix home care in Nevada. It is time to \nlisten to them and make them a part of the solution. \n \nThe State’s oversight of this industry is disbursed over several State agencies. \nThey include Medicaid and Health Care Quality and Compliance as the licensing \nentity over personal care agencies. The Labor Commissioner is over general \nemployment. We need to bring in a multitude of voices and opinions in order to \ncome up with the right solutions for this workforce. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nDo you see this more as a stakeholder engagement board or a labor relations \nboard? \n \nSENATOR NEAL: \nIt is set up to be both. One of the goals was to have a labor relations board \nbecause  of  the  wage  component,  which  is  why  they  wanted  the \nLabor Commissioner to be a part of it. We wanted to make sure if there was a \nwage issue, the Labor Commissioner would have authority. \n \nThe same concept was being considered for DHHS. Trying to find the home \nbest suited initially started off as a home under the Labor Commission, but \nseemed  it  was  better  suited  to  be  under  DHHS.  I  would  not  say  S.B  340 \nprovides a traditional board, but it is trying to manifest all the goals the Service \nEmployees International Union wanted by creating a blended task board. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nWhat tipped the scales to having authorization given to DHHS as opposed to the \nLabor Commission? \n \nSENATOR NEAL: \nThe things to be done were better suited in terms of expertise for DHHS versus \nthe  Labor  Commission.  The  Labor  Commission  focuses  on  wages  and \nenforcement of failure to pay wages. It is better for DHHS to get involved with \nregard to the larger issues of employment standards for home care, training and \nsystemic impact around home care employees. Many of those provisions are in \nsections 16 and 17 of the bill. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 14 \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nHave other states done similar things, and if so, what are the results? \n \nMS. TORTI: \nI can point out the states that have wage board-enabling statutes. They are not \nspecific to home care but have been used for other industries. They are Arizona, \nCalifornia, Colorado, New Jersey and New York. I am not able to speak to the \ndetails of those boards. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nAre they wage board specific leaning toward the labor relations board concept \nrather than the stakeholder engagement concept? \n \nMs. TORTI: \nYes. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIs it common practice for wage boards to create differentiated minimum wages \nfor different types of employees in each state? \n \nMS. TORTI: \nThat  has  happened  under  the  wage  boards,  speaking  more  specifically  to \npractice in the home care industry. It is a practice within Medicaid in other \nstates to set specific wage and compensation standards for this industry. It is \ncommon practice to set what percentage of the Medicaid reimbursement rate \ncan be retained by the agency or what percent of the rate has to be passed on \nto a home health care worker in the form of compensation. Other states have \nset a specific minimum wage for home care workers. This has all been under \nthe guidance and approval of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n(CMS). \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThe  proposal  before  us  would  set  a  minimum  wage  outside  of  Medicaid \nreimbursement.  It  would  be  inclusive  of  Medicaid  reimbursement  but  not \nexclusive to it, so it would be a minimum wage across the board for this job \nclassification, regardless of whether they work for a Medicaid client or not. \n \nMS. TORTI: \nThis would be specific to only publicly funded home care. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 15 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWhere in the bill is this stated? \n \nMS. TORTI: \nThe workforce is defined in section 5, subsection 1, paragraph (a). A home care \nemployee is a person who provides: “personal care services through a home \ncare program as an employee of a home care employer that is an agency to \nprovide personal care services in the home”. \n \nSection 8, subsection 1 states the: “’Home care program’ means a program \nestablished by a state agency or local government which provides in the home \npersonal care services…” \n \nThis section details the Medicaid State plan programs as examples of publicly \nfunded home care. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWhy is this a better way to state it than to say agencies must give 85 percent \nof their reimbursement rates to employees? \n \nMS. TORTI: \nIt  would  be  up  to  the  wage  board  to  decide  if  that  is  the  route  of  the \nrecommendation  around  compensation  for  home  care  workers.  It  does  not \nspecifically say a recommendation has to be around the minimum wage; it could \nbe a wage pass through as you described. \n \nTESS OPFERMAN (Nevada Women’s Lobby): \nThe  Nevada  Women’s  Lobby  supports  S.B. 340.  This  bill  will  help  families, \nseniors, women and people of color. Of the roughly 13,000 home care workers \nin Nevada, more than three-quarter are female, and over one-quarter are women \nof color. These workers make a median wage of $11 an hour, and a median \nincome of $15,500 per year. This leads to a high turnover rate in the home care \nindustry. Caring, qualified workers are leaving the profession at a rapid pace. \n \nWe  have  an  entire  workforce  trained  to  care  for  our  aging  parents  and \ngrandparents, allowing our family members to stay in their homes and get the \nservices they need. We have to pay a living wage. These workers must have \nestablished  training  regulations  and  receive  fair  pay  and  benefits. \nSenate Bill 340  is  a  key  solution  and  will  help  protect  these  workers.  This \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 16 \n \nmeans that those caring for our family members are well trained, experienced \nand invested in their jobs. \n \nPRISCILLA  MALONEY  (American  Federation  of  State,  County  and  Municipal \nEmployees): \nThe American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees support \nS.B. 340. We echo the comments of Ms. Opferman on behalf of the Nevada \nWomen’s Lobby. \n \nERMA HENDERSON: \nI support S.B. 340 as a home care worker in Las Vegas. During the pandemic, I \nworked without proper personal protective equipment and was afraid of being \ninfected and afraid I would bring Covid-19 home to my husband.  \n \nThis bill will help ensure home care workers are protected when facing future \nviruses or another public health crisis. With S.B. 340, we can make sure all \nhome care workers have the medical necessities to be safe. We urge you to \npass this bill so home care workers are adequately paid and receive the benefits \nthat are long overdue. Please respect us, protect us and pay us. \n \nTERRI LAIRD (Retired Public Employees of Nevada): \nRetired  Public  Employees  of  Nevada  support  S.B. 340.  As  we  age,  we \nsometimes need to receive specialized care, whether within the home where we \nare most comfortable or in a special care facility or hospital when necessary. \nWhen possible, care within our own homes is the preferable alternative and \nhighly qualified home care professional caregivers are essential to make that \npossible. The last year has pointed out the dangerous conditions that sometimes \npresent themselves in larger nursing home-type facilities where viruses can run \nrampant.  This  makes  in-home  care  more  preferable  when  possible. \nSenate Bill 340 seeks to create the home care workforce board needed in terms \nof working conditions for those that take care of seniors, the disabled and those \nunable to take care of themselves. \n \nDAWN RALENKOTTER: \nI support S.B. 340. I have been a home care worker for ten years. The low \nwage for home care workers in Nevada is $11.07 per hour. Most of us are \nstruggling to pay high out-of-pocket cost with the low wages we are paid. We \nare getting too few hours to give our clients the care they need. Senate Bill 340 \nwill help fix this problem. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 17 \n \nThe recertification training that I paid $40 for is not offered on a day that I can \nattend the class. I advised my client and employer about the need for a back-up \ncaregiver and was advised they would attempt to cover my client. I was signed \nup for the training but did not have anyone to cover my client. The training was \nnot what I expected, and I would like to know what that $40 paid for. This \noften happens with home care workers. My employer also wanted me to pay for \nfingerprints that had previously been paid for. I had to advocate for myself, \nletting my employer know they should be responsible for this cost. Every home \ncare worker cannot advocate for themselves to hold employers accountable. \nAgencies need more oversight, and as caregivers, we need a voice as frontline \nworkers. \n \nCAROL MATRONE: \nI  support  S.B. 340  for  myself  and  on  behalf  of  my  daughter  Maria  who  is \nchallenged and needs maximum care for her activities of daily living. She first \nreceived personal care services in 2000 after orthopedic surgery. She resides in \nan intensive supported living arrangement. She had 24/7 care from personal \ncare aids and direct support professionals through a subcontractor of Desert \nRegional Medical Center. I have been her unpaid caregiver for the last 30 years. \nI retired in 2020 from State service and dreamed of what retirement could be. \n \nIn  November,  we  both  had  four  Covid-19  tests.  We  had  near  misses  from \npersonal  care  attendants  who  traveled  to  numerous  clients  throughout  their \nworkday. When this occurred, the agencies would pull all providers from our \nhome, and I was the last care provider standing. At that time, I decided to \nbecome a paid caregiver. I cover four regular shifts as well as extra shifts when \nthere are no available personal care assistants. I am doing this physically taxing \njob at 63 years of age and my retirement is not a reality at this time. \n \nI am speaking on behalf of the hundreds of personal care attendants who have \nfiltered through my daughter’s life since 2000. These providers often travel to \n3 to 4 clients a day, all over the city, often working 10 to 14 hours a day to \nmake a living that can support them and their families, barely making ends \nmeet. Low pay, long hours, no travel stipends, inadequate training and no sick \nor paid time off plague these workers. They do not do this for the money, they \ndo  it  from  their  heart  and  soul  for  our  vulnerable  Nevadans.  Retention  and \nrecruitment  of  this  workforce  is  paramount  for  our  vulnerable  citizens  who \nreceive the most complex care. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 18 \n \nIn the future, you may need a caregiver, be a caregiver or hire a caregiver, and \nyour  loved  ones,  or  yourself,  deserve  one  who  is  respected,  protected  and \nearning a decent living wage. \n \nTYREE LOVE: \nI support S.B. 340. I have been a caregiver for 12 years, and I am proud of \nwhat I do. I want to provide a high quality of care to my clients so they can \nstay safely in their homes rather than going to a nursing home. This is what \nthey deserve, but it is hard to make a living at this profession. Even though \nhelping  senior  citizens  and  people  with  disabilities  has  never  been  more \nimportant during this pandemic, most of my clients do not receive adequate \nhours from the State to receive the level of care they deserve. \n \nIt is frustrating for me as a caregiver because I cannot deliver the quality of care \nI know my clients deserve. I have to drive all over the city to provide a couple of \nhours of care for one client and then rush to one after another. Senate Bill 340 \nwould  help  us  improve  the  quality  of  care  for  all  home  care  clients  and \n13,000 home care workers. It will provide workers and clients a seat at the \ntable and a voice to express their concerns about the service clients need. \n \nTRACEY RICHARDS: \nI support S.B. 340. I have been in the caregiving field for over 15 years. As a \nhome care worker, I am responsible for everything our clients cannot do for \nthemselves. Many of our clients no longer have family or friends to help them, \nso they depend on us for everyday tasks. This includes bathing, feeding, using \nthe bathroom, purchasing their groceries and cleaning around the house. My \nclients  are  getting  a  limited  number  of  hours  of  care  each  week.  What  is \nworrisome is that some of our clients do not always get the hours of care they \ndeserve. Unfortunately, in my experience it is the black clients experiencing \nthose  few  hours  of  care.  We  know  Black  people  face  inequalities  in  the \nhealthcare system in this Country. Covid-19 has affected the black communities \nmore than others. We cannot allow that to continue and repeat these injustices \nin the home care industry. Home care workers such as myself and my clients \nneed our voices heard and a seat at the table. \n \nIt is also a hardship for caregivers to pay for our fingerprints, tuberculosis tests, \nimmunizations, certification training, CPR and first aid training just to start a job. \nI recently began working at a new agency and did not have the $65 for the \nfingerprints that I just had done for my previous employer. This impacted me \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 19 \n \nand kept me from caring for my client. Passing S.B. 340 will allow us to work \nwith home care personal care agencies and the State to develop solutions to the \nserious inequalities many of us experience as home care workers and our clients \nface in their homes. \n \nROZETTA LOVE: \nI support S.B. 340. I have been a home care worker for 11 years. We do this \nwork because we care deeply about our clients and our community. We do not \nexpect to get rich doing it, but we deserve to be treated fairly, and our clients \ndeserve quality care. About half of home care workers cannot make a living \ndoing this job. It is my hope that we can create good quality jobs with livable \nwages so that the next generation of home care workers can proudly take care \nof our loved ones in need of care. \n \nCHERYL KNIGHT: \nI support S.B. 340. Our system for caregivers and clients who need them is \nbroken. This bill will provide those of us who are involved in the caregiving field \na seat at the table to decide how to best manage the funds provided to the \nState for both clients and caregivers. It seems the State would rather pay for a \nhospital stay or put a client in a nursing home instead of paying a decent wage \nto a caregiver to provide care in the client’s home. Many clients need more \nhours  to  be  taken  care  of  properly.  Clients  and  caregivers  need  personal \nprotective equipment provided to them at no cost to protect them. \n \nAs a caregiver, I can tell you that every client is different and broad sweeping \nrules about who gets what does not work. To be considered a front-line worker, \ncaregivers need personal protective equipment, and training and education that \nis not at their own expense. There are those who burn out quickly because the \npay is too low and half the workforce leaves the job within a year. When we \npay so little, do not provide proper training, equipment and sick time, we prove \nas a State we do not value and respect these workers. People who are caring \nfor others’ personal needs deserve to be paid better. \n \nNevada needs people who are involved in this work to be a part of the process \nin making decisions on how to spend the allocated funds for our State. Without \nthat, we have poorly run offices, underpaid workers, clients without enough \ncare and consideration; the list is long. We need to fix the broken system, give \nthe clients the hours they need for proper care and pay the workers a decent \nwage. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 20 \n \nIRMA NUNEZ: \nI support S.B. 340. I have been a home care worker for 12 years working for \n3 agencies and caring for 7 patients. I am a diabetic, have personal health care \nissues and need to be under a doctor’s care, which is costly. Five months ago, I \nhad a medical issue and went to the emergency room. The bill was expensive. I \nprovide care for others, but my job does not provide the benefit of caring for \nmyself. Home care workers work all day and night to ensure the health of their \nclients. We would like our health taken care of as well. During the Covid-19 \npandemic, we risked our lives to do our jobs. Senate Bill 340 will create the \nBoard that will investigate whether home care providers have access to quality, \naffordable health care. \n \nSHAWN SLATTER (Right at Home Care; Personal Care Association of Nevada): \nI own and operate Right at Home Care, Las Vegas, one of the larger personal \ncare agencies in Las Vegas, and oppose S.B. 340. I have been the provider and \nemployer of choice for the last five consecutive years. Should the Committee \nnot be aware, our industry is already regulated by the DHHS under regulation in \nthe Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 449 that depicts and calls regulation into \nwhat we are supposed to be training and not training for. \n \nMany of the speakers in support of S.B. 340 have spoken of various trainings \nand things they have paid for. In Nevada, it is illegal for any agency to require \nanyone to pay for their own training. Every agency is required to provide said \ntraining. Fingerprinting, health backgrounds, physician statements, and two-part \ntuberculosis tests are State-mandated by the Legislature that these employees \nmust have in order to perform work in this industry. We do not have the budget \nto  pay  for  these  items.  We  are  all  in  favor  of  increasing  wages  which \noften times is depicted by what Medicaid reimbursement rates are. Again, those \nare set by the Legislators. We understand there are bad apples in the industry. \nWe have been working as an association with DHHS, as well as the Office of \nLabor Commissioner, to get those agencies to act accordingly and follow the \nlabor laws. As an owner/operator, the leading provider and employer of choice, \nwe do everything we can to take care of our personal care attendants. \n \nThere  is  also  a  letter  of  opposition  provided  by  Advanced  Personal  Care \nSolutions (Exhibit L). \n \nCONNIE MCMULLEN (Personal Care Association of Nevada): \nI have submitted written testimony in opposition to S.B. 340 (Exhibit M). \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 21 \n \nBETH HANDLER, M.P.H. (Deputy Director, Programs, Department of Health and \nHumans Services): \nThe DHHS acknowledges the intent of S.B. 340 to assure equity, living wage \nand advance rights for home care providers. The Covid-19 pandemic magnified \nthe  need  for  home  care  employment  standards  and  addressing  inequities. \nFive states have existing statutes under their labor code enabling the creation of \nworkforce boards, also referred to as wage boards. Portions of the authority of \nlabor and wage standards in this bill would be new to DHHS authority, and a \nfiscal note will be required to create this type of infrastructure. \n \nSENATOR NEAL: \nThis bill is about creating an industry standard so there is a place and a voice for \nthe issues to be heard. Right now, there is no voice; there is no place outside of \nthe employer. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 340 and open the hearing on S.B. 309. \n \nSENATE BILL 309: Establishes a reinvestment advisory committee in certain \nlarger counties. (BDR 38-956) \n \nSENATOR DINA NEAL (Senatorial District No. 4): \nSenate Bill 309 has a unique origin. Assembly Bill No. 73 of the 80th Session \nwas  a  bill  that  came  from  the  City  of  Las  Vegas  which  mandated  local \ngovernments come together to find solutions for homelessness, and as a result \nwe have S.B. 309. \n \nJOANNA JACOB: (Clark County): \nThe working group for A.B. No. 73 of the 80th Session met approximately \n12 times  during  the  biennium,  and  we  came  up  with  recommendations  to \naddress homelessness. We also identified our needs, funding gaps and solutions \nwe can use as a road and policy map going forward. Some items, such as \nfunding which is a crucial component in Nevada, will have to wait in order to \nunderstand the challenges the Covid-19 pandemic posed on distinct local and \ngovernment budgets. \n \nThe working group identified our system capacity to address homelessness as \npart  of  our  efforts.  We  have  worked  on  a  regional  basis  to  address \nhomelessness. By the local government participating in that group, we have \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 22 \n \ncollectively  spent  $55  million  committed  community-wide  to  address \nhomelessness across our service continuum. One of the things we identified as \nthe single largest barrier to the expansion of affordable housing and services in \nour region was funding. In housing alone in one year, $46 million to $55 million \nwould be needed to address homelessness if we were to house our homeless \npopulation. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, we are seeing an increase in \nnewly homeless individuals and families. \n \nThe  working  group  took  steps  to  address  homelessness  and  broke  it  into \nsix areas. One area that is working well is the regional oversight framework \nSenator  Dina  Neal  put  forward  in  A.B.  No. 73  of  the  80th  Session.  One \ngovernment working alone cannot address this on their own. We know we have \nsignificant  needs  in  housing,  behavioral  health,  services  and  intensive  case \nmanagement, coordination of data, prevention and intervention, and affordable \nhousing and development incentives which make up the remaining categories. \n \nThe Senate Bill 309 working group built off one of those strategies, which is the \nregional  oversight  idea.  Each  member  of  the  working  group  made  joint \nrecommendations, specifically taking advantage to leverage public and private \npartnerships to help us find solutions at the local and state government levels. \n \nExamples of where this has worked and is underway in southern Nevada speak \nto what we are proposing in S.B. 309. We have managed care vendors who \nserve people mostly at risk for housing and need support. They often partner \nwith local government to help with funding. In Arizona, as part of a community \nreinvestment  initiative  proposed  in  this  Committee,  one  managed  care \norganization (MCO) partnered with a local nonprofit to provide funding for a \n500 unit supportive housing unit. They partnered with the local government to \nhelp build it and mix the funding. The MCO will provide case management and \nhousing support for the people enrolled in their programs. \n \nWe have a program like that in southern Nevada. It started with a partnership \nbetween Clark County and Health Plan of Nevada and has since extended to all \nthree MCOs called Hospital to Home, a rapid rehousing program for medically \nfragile  and  literally  homeless  households.  We  use  our  U.S.  Department  of \nHousing and Urban Development funding at the county level and partner with \nthe MCOs to provide case management for their members in partnership with \nthe nonprofit, Help of Southern Nevada. It has been successful, and to date, we \nhave served 139 members through this program. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 23 \n \nWe looked at some of the things that are working in a way to continue this \ncollaboration. The State has been researching ways to address how to maximize \nMedicaid solutions to reduce the rate of the uninsured and tackle some of the \nsocial determinates of health that act as barriers to accessing health care. Also \nfinding  ways  to  maximize  community  reinvestment  dollars  was  a \nrecommendation made to the State in a report done by Princeton University \npublished in 2000. \n \nSenate Bill 309 will allow a forum for collaboration between the State, counties, \nlocal governments, nonprofits and the managed care vendors selected in the \nforthcoming request for proposal (RFP), to identify opportunities and gaps we \nhave in our existing service delivery continuum. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWill it be a requirement that managed care organizations make an investment \nback into the community? \n \nCODY L. PHINNEY M.P.H. (Deputy  Administrator,  Division  of  Health  Care \nFinancing and Policy, Department of Health and Human Services): \nOur managed care RFP published on March 17, requires in the scope of work \nany vendors participating in our contract start January 2022 and participate in \nthe  community  reinvestment  fund  as  a  portion  of  their  pre-tax  profits.  This \nwould be distributed by a plan the vendors would develop, and the State would \napprove. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWhat portion of their pre-tax profits? \n \nMS. PHINNEY: \nThe current scope of work is 3 percent of their pre-tax profits. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThis would be Nevada-based? \n \nMS. PHINNEY: \nFor this program, yes. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 24 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nAre  there  other  industries  that  participate  in  this  fund?  Managed  care \norganizations are not the root cause of homelessness. We have contracts with \nother types of vendors such as hospitals and physicians; why MCOs? \n \nMS. PHINNEY: \nThis  is  a  program  that  has  been  implemented  in  other  states,  and  the \nmechanism  is  allowable  under  the  managed  care  guidelines  from  the  CMS. \nOther types of vendors you mentioned would not fall into those managed care \nguidelines. That is the Medicaid aspect. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nActuarially set, the per-member, per-month numbers are done absent of this \ncalculation.  Does  this  increase  show  how  much  we  pay  on  a  per-member, \nper-month level for states? \n \nMS. PHINNEY: \nAre you asking if this impacts the capitation rate? \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nYes. \n \nMS. PHINNEY: \nIt  is  my  understanding  that  it  could.  We  are  in  the  process  of  setting  the \ncapitation  rates  for  2022.  I  can  confirm  this  with  other  states  that  have \nimplemented such a plan. \n \nSENATOR RATTI: \nWhy just Clark County if we are doing a Statewide bid on MCOs? Would the \nsame structure apply to Washoe and rural Counties? \n \nSENATOR NEAL: \nSenate Bill 309 had focused on the south, including Mesquite and Boulder City. \nBecause A.B. No. 73 of the 80th Session was brought by the south, there was \na conversation that Washoe County does not have an interest in being a part of \nthis structure; it was not a direct exclusion. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 25 \n \nMS. JACOB: \nThe recommendation and the genesis for the working group committee came \nout of conversations among the regions in the south. We felt since we are \nfacing such a tremendous need in southern Nevada, not to belabor the point, \nthis report shows we have a significant gap. We felt we needed more people at \nthe  table  to  help  address  the  gap.  The  bill  is  written  permissively.  In  the \namendment  we  worked  on  giving  the  Director  of  DHHS  more  discretion  to \nappoint non-voting members that could build upon the Committee. \n \nMS. PHINNEY: \nOur RFP will be for Washoe and Clark Counties. It is possible it could expand, \nbut it does not address the rural counties at this time. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will need someone from Washoe County to follow up with me on this to \nunderstand why they would not want funding for services. \n \nIt was stated the bill was written permissively. Would the bill as written allow \nfor a similar structure set up in Washoe County? \n \nMS. JACOB: \nThe language could be easily modified if needed; maybe permissive was not the \ncorrect term. There is some room for changes.  \n \nI  do  not  represent  Washoe  County  and  cannot  speak  for  them.  I  will  have \nsomeone follow up on your funding question. \n \nKEVIN SCHILLER (Clark County): \nI agree with what Ms. Jacob stated. We had a meeting yesterday about the \nimplications of addiction, behavioral health, medical access and all of the pieces \nsignificant  in  terms  of  making  the  dollar  go  farther.  When  you  look  at  the \nAffordable Care Act (ACA) and the things that have changed, it is an alignment \nissue that from the days of County funding, social service and medical access. \nThere  are  diverse  community  barriers  to  the  medical  front  door.  These \npartnerships exist and continue to evolve. We want to ensure we are aligning \nour service array with the ACA’s array, create increased access and efficiency \nof  funding.  It  is  about  making  the  dollar  go  farther  where  we  have  the \nopportunity. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 26 \n \nIf a client is in the hospital, they are paying ten times what they would pay for a \nprovision of services we are providing in a program such as the Hospital to \nHome program, which is a win for the MCOs. For reinvestment purposes, we \nwant  to  make  sure  that  when  the  MCOs  reinvest,  we  can  align  with  their \nbenefit in terms of what works for us. \n \nIn a crisis where  we have a  lot of one-shot funding coming,  we are in an \nopportunistic time. At the ground level, we are where we must be in order to \ncreate that front door and access point with our large partners. The State is our \nlargest partner, and we have mastered that. This is the wave of the future in \nterms of how we increase services levels. \n \nOn the managed care side, they have contracts and are accountable to those \ncontracts, and our clients are their clients. This is the other piece in terms of \nwhere the gaps are and how the county funds a gap. Where we put our dollars \nto fund a gap is not necessarily covered in an MCO plan, but can create a \nservice  array  for  that  hard  to  reach  addicted  client  that  may  be  in  west \nLas Vegas or in a rural area. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nThere are specific services that MCOs provide that qualify toward meeting a \ncertain threshold, and the MCO’s are required to provide a report. They get to \ndictate how they spend their money. If the effort is to try to direct how they \nspend their money why are they not on the advisory committee? Do MCOs \nrequire a contract for community reinvestment? \n \nMS. PHINNEY: \nThey do not. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nDoes the contract lay out the specific categories that qualify towards meeting \nthat threshold?  \n \nMS. PHINNEY: \nThere are particular items in the current RFP that are specific. The vendors are \nrequired to provide a State-approved plan. If they provide a plan that does not \nadequately  meet  the  advice  of  this  Committee,  we  would  be  asking  for  a \nredrafted plan. This is a process we go through with the MCOs on a regular \nbasis. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 27 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWhat is the estimated dollar figure you expect to be contributed through the \ncommunity reinvestment piece of the contract? \n \nMS. PHINNEY: \nI do not have that figure, but I will get it for the Committee. \n \nMS. JACOB: \nThe intent is not to dictate that an MCO sit on an opportunity; that is why we \nwrote it as recommendations. We wrote it two ways. The bill states the local \ngovernments  will  be  reporting  to  the  MCOs  because  they  have  a  plan \nrequirement  to  deliver  to  the  State.  The  reports  that  will  be  required  are \nimportant for transparency for both the counties and the MCOs. You will see \nwhere  we  might  be  able  to  create  these  partnerships  and  know  what  is \nhappening  in  the  collaborations  between  the  State,  local  government  and \nmanaged care. This is why, in the proposed amendment (Exhibit N) we have the \nreporting going to both the Director of the DHHS and the Legislature through \nthe annual report. \n \nJARED LUKE (City of Las Vegas): \nThe  City  of  Las  Vegas  supports  S.B. 309.  We  appreciate  collaborating  and \nproviding input to this group and look forward to developing creative measures \nto help those in need. \n \nKELLY CROMPTON (City of Las Vegas): \nThe City of Las Vegas supports S.B. 309. I echo the remarks from our municipal \ncolleague from Clark County. \n \nDAVID CHERRY (City of Henderson): \nThe City of Henderson supports S.B. 309. The City of Henderson was an active \nparticipant in the A.B. No. 73 of the 80th Session working group which sought \nto  create  a  regional  focus  on  the  issue  of  homelessness.  The  Committee \nenvisioned S.B. 309 would present another opportunity to continue this focus \nand address other issues related to reinvesting funds in our community. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 309 and open the hearing on S.B. 305. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 28 \n \nSENATE  BILL  305:  Makes  various  changes  relating  to  access  to  organ \ntransplants for persons with disabilities. (BDR 40-40) \n \nSENATOR SCOTT HAMMOND: (Senatorial District No. 18): \nSenate Bill 305 prohibits certain providers of medical or related services from \ntaking  certain  actions  related  to  organ  transplant  solely  on  the  basis  of  a \nperson’s disability. \n \nIt authorizes a person aggrieved by the failure of such providers to comply with \ncertain requirements to institute a civil action for injunctive or other appropriate \nrelief. \n \nIt prohibits an insurer from taking certain actions related to an organ transplant \nbecause the insured is a person with a disability. It prevents a provider of health \ncare services from not placing a person with a disability on a transplant list, or \nplacing a patient low on the transplant list because of their disability. \n \nSenate Bill 305 does not take away a physician’s ability to diagnose a patient \nand determine whether or not the patient is eligible or a good fit for a particular \norgan transplant. \n \nWe are attempting to ensure people with disabilities, whether intellectual or \ncognitive, are not denied an organ transplant because of their disability. \n \nRACHAEL CHESIN (Caleb’s Law): \nCaleb’s Law supports S.B. 305. Caleb’s Law is an Act relating to health care \nand  the  organ  transplant  services  for  people  with  dishabilles  described  by \nSenator Hammond.  My  presentation  (Exhibit  O)  will  provide  information  on \nCaleb’s Law. \n \nI was born and raised in Las Vegas, and I am the Community Engagement \nDirector  of  the  nonprofit,  The  Just  One  Project.  My  son  Caleb  is  a  happy, \nhealthy 22-month-old, and has Trisomy 21, Down syndrome, which means he \nhas an extra copy of the 21st chromosome. \n \nI recently heard a story about a little girl, not yet a year old, living with her \nfamily in Ohio and in need of a heart transplant. Her parents were told she was \nnot eligible for a heart transplant, not because of her illness, but because she \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 29 \n \nhad Down syndrome. The doctors determined that since she had an intellectual \ndisability, her life was not worth saving because of an extra chromosome. \n \nWhen I heard this story, I believed it had to be an anomaly, some type of \ndoctors acting outside of standards of care. I heard many stories of others being \ndenied organ transplants due to their disabilities. A young boy with autism, a \nsmall  girl  denied  a  kidney,  a  5-month-old  boy  denied  a  heart  due  to  a \nchromosomal disorder similar to Down syndrome. \n \nI realized that if my son Caleb, who is healthy with no medical concerns to \nspeak  of  other  than  being  born  prematurely,  needed  an  organ  tomorrow,  it \nwould be because of an accident or trauma. It would have nothing to do with \nhis diagnosis of Down syndrome. Yet, studies show 85 percent of pediatric \ntransplant  centers  would  take  Caleb’s  intellectual  disability  into  account. \nInformation shows 71 percent of heart programs indicate even mild or moderate \ncognitive impairment is enough to disqualify him from the organ transplant list. \nTransplant centers usually consider intellectual diagnosis’s when deciding the \neligibility  of  transplantation.  Fifty-two  percent  of  people  with  intellectual \ndiagnosis receive a referral for a specialist evaluation, and 33 percent of those \n52 percent referred are never evaluated. \n \nIn February 2019, the University of North Carolina (UNC) was forced to resolve \nan investigation by the United States Department of Health and Human Services \nafter denying someone a heart transplant because of a learning disability. When \ntheir actions were challenged, UNC immediately reversed course with the United \nStates Department of Health and Human Services issuing this statement from \nDirector Roger Severino of the Office of Civil Rights; “Every life is precious and \nno  one  should  be  blocked  from  access  to  an  organ  transplant  because  of \nstereotypes about persons with disabilities. It is also against the law”. \n \nThis is an important point and the reason I am here today to support the ban of \norgan transplant discrimination in Nevada. We are not asking the State to do \nanything new or to reinvent the wheel. Discrimination in medical services is \nalready  illegal  under  the  federal  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  (ADA).  The \nproblem  is  enforcement.  There  is  no  way  for  you  or  I  to  enforce  the  ADA \nbecause it has no mechanism for enforcement. That leaves the State on our \nown to not just prove that discrimination but to give people an effective way to \nchallenge discrimination when and where it happens. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 30 \n \nThis is where Caleb’s Law comes in. Caleb’s Law clarifies doctors, hospitals, \ntransplant centers and other health care providers are prohibited from denying \naccess  to  necessary  organ  transplants  solely  on  the  basis  of  a  qualified \nindividual’s disability. It requires health care providers who are evaluating the \nlikelihood of transplant success consider the full range of support available to \nhelp a person with a disability manage their post-operative care. It also includes \na  fast-track  procedure  for  challenging  discrimination  and  ensures  people  in \nurgent need of an organ transplant can obtain timely resolutions to their claim. \n \nI have reached out to doctors across the State who head up multiple transplant \ncenters  throughout  the  Country.  I  also  contacted  the  American  Heart \nAssociation, the Children’s Heart Center Nevada and Opportunity Village and \nhave not heard one word of opposition to this bill. The response seems to be \none of understanding. Senate Bill 305 represents a significant step forward in \nthe protection of people with disabilities in Nevada. \n \nFifteen States have passed laws similar to this and another 13 have similar bills \npending in 2021. In almost every instance, those bills were proposed because \nsomeone  with  a  disability  was  in  a  desperate  and  immediate  need  of  a \nlife-saving transplant and was facing unfair discrimination. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nAre people with disabilities able to donate an organ? \n \nMS. CHESIN: \nThis bill is specific to those needing an organ transplant. \n \nDAN MUSGROVE (Nevada Donor Network): \nA person with a disability can donate an organ. Typically, the caregiver of the \nperson with a disability can authorize someone who is disabled to give the gift \nof life through organ donation. \n \nNevada Donor Network supports S.B. 305. Based on the population size we \nserve,  the  Nevada  Donor  Network  has  the  distinction  of  being  the  most \nproductive and successful organ procurement organization in the world. This is \nprimarily because of how inclusive we are as an organization. Sadly, 20 people \ndie each day in the United States waiting for the gift of life which never comes \nbecause of the shortage of organs available for transplantation. Among those \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 31 \n \nwho parish every day, are the most vulnerable citizens who must be assured an \nequal chance at life and health, regardless of what disability they may have. \n \nBRITTNEY PERKINS: \nI support S.B. 305. I am a resident of Henderson, Nevada. I am an attorney, and \nthe proud mother of a disabled daughter who at 4 months old had open heart \nsurgery to repair a hole in her heart. She has the additional 21st chromosome \nwhich led to her mild cognitive delay or perpetual happiness. Because of her \ngenetic make-up, if her heart repair had been unsuccessful, she could have been \ndenied a heart transplant due to this genetic condition that has no bearing on \nthe functionality of that transplant. \n \nNo parent should have to sit through that situation while their child is having \nsurgery and financially shoulder the burden that should the procedure not be \neffective and their child require an organ transplant, they might not get one \nbecause their child wears the title of disabled. These individuals are somehow \ndeemed less worthy of these life-saving measures. Times have changed and \nsociety  has  evolved.  My  daughter  is  entitled  to  the  benefits  of  the  equal \nprotection clause and enforcement of the ADA. \n \nThere is no place left in this State for organ transplant discrimination. We often \nthink a law is just a law until your child’s life depends on it, and it takes on a \nnew meaning. My child’s life is worth living and saving. \n \nCANDACE WONG: \nI support S.B. 305. I am a registered nurse and have a five-year-old daughter \nwho was born with Trisomy 21, Down syndrome. She communicates with her \npeers through an all-inclusive program, loves to rock climb, ride her bike and \nscooter and is active in every activity we partake in as a family. She is also \nactive in the community, cleaning up trails at Mt. Charleston, Red Rock and in \nthe Henderson area. Along with her twin sister and a friend of the family, we \ncollect  food  and  donations  for  Three  Square  and  do  walks  throughout  the \ncommunity to help multiple organizations in the area raise awareness. \n \nAt five years of age, she has made an impact along with her fellow peers at \nschool and in the community. She is entitled to the same benefits as her twin \nsister who does not have Trisomy 21. Both of them were born premature at \n29 weeks  and  weighed  less  than  3  pounds.  My  daughter  was  born  with \nduodenal atresia, had surgery, and a 5 percent chance of survival through the \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 32 \n \nneonatal  intensive  care  unit.  She  is  here  today,  surviving  and  leading  all \nPre-K standards just like her peers. \n \nEvery individual has different medical concerns and conditions, but each one \nshould be evaluated prior to denying or accessing transplantation. A person with \na disability such as Down syndrome can and has donated an organ as long as \npermission is given. They also vote and work. We have resources available to \nassist people with disabilities to be a part of the community. This is not a time \nwhen people with disabilities are forgotten or institutionalized. They are here \nand will continue to be a part of our community. \n \nDUANE  YOUNG  (Deputy  Administrator,  Division  of  Health  Care  Financing  and \nPolicy, Department of Health and Human Services): \nThe Division of Health Care Financing and Policy is neutral to S.B. 305 and \nbelieves this is good public health policy; however, the Division does request a \nfriendly amendment. The language states the provisions in S.B. 305 must go \ninto the State plan. This is our contract with CMS, and this language would be \nbest  in  our  Medicaid  Services  Manual  holding  all  providers  and  partners  of \nMedicaid accountable to the language in the bill. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nThe  Committee’s  legal  counsel  has  provided  an  answer  to  the  question  of \npeople with disabilities donating an organ. Based on NRS 451.556, people with \na disability can donate under the same circumstances as anyone else. \n \nSENATOR HAMMOND: \nI am amenable to the amendment proposed by Mr. Young. It fits in with what \nwe are trying to accomplish; we want to ensure it is in the right place. \n \nMy legislative assistant provided me with an article from January 2020 quoting: \n \n“Every second counts when a sick child needs an organ transplant.  \nBut parents of people with disabilities may need years to get their \nchildren on the list. \n \nPeople with disabilities can be organ donors. They can give all their \norgans; there’s no law against it. But if someone with a disability \nneeds an organ transplant, that fact alone can get them removed \nfrom the list.” \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 33 \n \nIn a time when we are trying to equal things out, S.B. 305 seeks to do just that, \nbringing equality to the disabled community. \n \nCHAIR RATTI: \nI will close the hearing on S.B. 305 and open the hearing on S.B. 329. \n \nSENATE  BILL  329:  Revises  provisions  relating  to  competition  in  health  care \nmarkets. (BDR 40-998) \n \nSENATOR ROBERTA LANGE (Senatorial District No. 7): \nI will read from my written remarks (Exhibit P) as I present S.B. 329 and discuss \nthe conceptual amendment (Exhibit Q). \n \nSTACIE SASSO (Executive Director, Health Services Coalition): \nThe  Health  Services  Coalition  represents  25  employer  and  union-sponsored \nhealth plans in southern Nevada, including MGM, Boyd Gaming, firefighters, \npolice  and  numerous  self-funded  union  plans,  including  culinary,  electrical \nworkers, plumbers and various other groups. The Coalition’s main focus is to \nbring affordable quality health care to our estimated 300,000 clients in southern \nNevada. \n \nBOBBETTE BOND (Director of Public Policy, Culinary Health Fund): \nWe  are  a  nonprofit  fund  that  provides  comprehensive  benefits  to \n125,000 people in Las Vegas. We have two pharmacies and a large primary \ncare  center  that  had  40,000  visits  the  year  before  the  Covid-19  pandemic \nstarted.  We  are  a  piece  of  the  healthcare  market,  and  our  focus  is  on \nhigh-quality affordable health care and how to get there. We are aggressive \nabout trying to be effective stewards of both private and public money for \nNevada. \n \nAs Senator Lange outlined, there is an increasing consolidation in the healthcare \nindustry, healthcare hospital systems buying other system and private equity \nbuying up doctor groups. Experts expect that trend to continue with Covid-19 \nbecause  of  its  impact  on  the  healthcare  industry.  I  have  a  presentation \n(Exhibit R) outlining some of these impacts. \n \nWe know consolidation is happening in Nevada, and our markets are already \nimpacted. We do not yet have any line of sight into the impact of consolidation \nand its impact in Nevada. Price is a primary factor behind the United States high \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 34 \n \nhealth  care  costs  compared  to  other  nations,  and  consolidation  and  lack  of \ncompetition is a critical factor in health care prices. \n \nPrices in health care have increased must faster than inflation. Hospital prices in \nthe United States have increased at a staggering pace over the last 20 years \noutstripping college tuition, wages and housing. According to CMS, hospital \nprices rose three times the rate of inflation between 1960 and 2016. \n \nIf prices did the same thing in the food market, we would pay $57 for a crate of \noranges, $65 for a dozen eggs and $160 for a gallon of milk. \n \nThere are two kinds of industry consolidation. The first is horizontal. This is \nwhen one facility buys another like facility and are in the same place in the \nhealthcare  market.  That  is  often  a  hospital  to  hospital  merger.  Studies \nrepeatedly  show  this  kind  of  consolidation  results  in  higher  prices  without \nimproving quality, which is what we are interested in. Academically, researchers \nfound post-merger hospital prices increased 20 percent to 44 percent, and they \nwere  not  associated  with  improved  quality.  It  was  modestly  worse  patient \nquality and patient experience. \n \nThe second industry consolidation is vertical. This is when one industry higher \nin the health care chain purchases or absorbs one lower on the chain, and when \na large physician group purchases a specialty group. A recent study shows over \na 4-year period, a 32 percent to 47 percent increase in prices with no quality \nimprovement  occurs  when  hospitals  or  physician  groups  merge.  In  the  last \n5 years, there has been $10 billion worth of consolidation private equity money \nalone coming into the healthcare market buying medical practices. We know \nthis is happening and have personal experiences we see in contracts, but we do \nnot have any line of sight policywise to see the system in Nevada, and that is \nwhy S.B. 329 was brought forward. \n \nThe private equity playbook in most industries is to leverage the debit to buy the \ncompany,  cut  costs  and  sell  at  a  profit  within  three  to  five  years  at  an \nannualized rate of return between 20 percent and 30 percent. It is not like \nbuying  cars.  We  are  talking  about  people’s  health  and  lives,  and  when  it \nbecomes a monetary transaction, we are losing the things health care needs to \nhave. State and federal authority exists to prevent competition and unfair stock \npractices  that  hurt  competition,  but  health  care  deals  fall  below  the  radar, \nespecially in Nevada. It takes a high level of an integrated merger in order for us \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 35 \n \nto be aware of it. Increasingly, states are looking at other ways to get their \narms around understanding what is going on with competition and try to protect \nthe healthcare market to keep it healthy and competitive. \n \nMAYA HOLMES (Culinary Health Fund): \nSenate Bill 329 will ensure Nevada has accessible data on what is happening in \nour healthcare markets to protect health care competition. This information is \ncritical for the State, policymakers, patients, payers and other stakeholders in \norder to understand consolidation in our healthcare market and guide decisions \nthat  protect  competition  and  patient  choice.  It  will  also  ensure  we  address \nmarket players who are trying to use their market power to drive up prices and \nthwart competition based on price and quality. \n \nThis bill proposes prohibiting anticompetitive contracting practices hospitals and \nhealth care providers with market dominance can demand because payers have \nto have them in their markets. \n \nThere were recent settlements in two major anti-trust lawsuits; one in California \ninvolving  the  Sutter  Health  system  and  another  in  North  Carolina.  These \nsettlements ended many of the anticompetitive contracting practices. However, \nthe settlements did not set legal precedence, and they only apply to the health \nsystem involved in the lawsuits which were major multi-year lawsuits. \n \nAnticompetitive  contracting  practices  like  all-or-nothing,  anti-steering  and \nanti-tiering prevent health plans from directing or incentivizing patients toward \nlower-cost, higher-quality care. These provisions prevent other hospitals from \nbenefiting if they offer better deals or higher quality. They stop patients and \nhealth plans from shopping for and getting the best deal. \n \nWe  are  working  with  Senator  Lange  on  some  of  the  language  involving \nself-funded  plans,  but  that  work  will  not  change  the  substance  of  the \nconceptual  amendment,  Exhibit  Q,  and  how  we  are  proposing  it  will  affect \nS.B. 329. \n \nAs  a  result  of  the  conceptual  amendment,  Exhibit  Q,  the  bill  will  have \ntwo primary provisions. First, the bill will require reporting on health care deals \ninvolving hospitals and physician groups 60 days after they have occurred. It \nwould require basic summary information to be reported. That information is \nlisted in the bill. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 36 \n \nA portion of the bill requires DHHS to post the information contained in the \nnotices  on  an  internet  website  maintained  by  DHHS  which  is  important  for \ntransparency. Connecticut has done this for several years. The DHHS would \nalso prepare an annual report with the summary information regarding market \ntransactions and concentration in health care based on those notices. \n \nSecond, the bill’s other major provision would make specific anticompetitive \ncontract provisions unfair trade practices, and those prohibited provisions would \nbe  void  and  severable.  The  specific  contract  provisions  between  hospitals, \nhealth systems, providers and health plans would be prohibited as an unfair \ntrade  practice  and  are  anti-tiering  and  anti-steering  clauses.  These  clauses \nessentially require health plans to place all health system hospitals in the most \nfavorable  tier  with  the  lowest  cost-sharing  regardless  of  the  rates  they  are \ncharging or their quality. \n \nThe  other  anticompetitive  provision  prohibited  would  be  all-or-nothing \ncontracting. Some health systems demand an insurer include all the systems \nfacilities in their network. This would be regardless of whether a plan needs the \nfacilities for their members if it drives up health care costs or is a lower-quality \nfacility. \n \nKATHERINE GUDIKSEN (Senior Health Policy Researcher, The Source on Healthcare \nPrice and Competition): \nThere  are  seven  other  states  considering  similar  bills  this  Session  to  ban \nparticular contract terms, anti-sharing, anti-steering or all-or-nothing contracting \nas shown in my presentation (Exhibit S). This creates unfair trade practices and \nthese seven states ban them in those contracts. The federal government also \nconsidered  similar  language  last  Session,  but  it  did  not  make  it  through \nCongress at the end of the Session. The Lower Health Care Costs Act of 2019 \nwould have banned these provisions for all plans. \n \nSENATOR HARDY: \nNarrow  networks  seem  to  be  anticompetitive.  A  physician  cannot  enter  a \ncontract that has certain provisions that restrain the ability of an insured to \ncontract with other providers of health care. Is this going to create more of a \nnarrow network but not allow a narrow network to happen? \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 37 \n \nMS. GUDIKSEN: \nSenate Bill 329 would allow insurers to develop narrow networks so this would \nbe another option. Many of the large health systems require their inclusion in a \nnetwork, so it is hard for insurers to steer patients toward higher value, higher \nquality care. This bill would prevent that. It does not prevent insurers from \ncreating narrow networks or physicians from entering narrow networks. \n \nMS. BOND: \nIt also does not encourage them. It is not about narrow networks. What we are \ntrying  to  do  is  make  sure  patients  have  the  ability  to  use  their  copays, \ndeductibles and their part of the health care costs to go to the facility that has \nthe best quality. It is the opposite of what you are suggesting. We have large \nnetworks and want to keep all the current doctors and hospitals under contract. \nPatients  need  to  have  the  ability  with  their  own  dollars  to  go  within  that \nnetwork to the place they can receive the best quality and not be prohibited by \na contract to do that. \n \nSENATOR HARRIS: \nIn Nevada, the Attorney General has plenary powers to pursue deceptive and \nunfair  practices.  Can  you  explain  why  those  powers  are  not  sufficient  to \naddress this type of anticompetitive behavior? \n \nMS. BOND:  \nThere is another bill this Session to try to deal with some of this, but what we \nhave  heard  from  the  Office  of  the  Attorney  General  is  they  are  not  in  the \nbusiness of making any of this information public. For public policy reasons and \nto understand the ecosystem and the market, we need it to be public. They only \nhandle issues at a high dollar threshold, similar to United Healthcare merging \nwith Sierra Health Services which received a lot of action a decade ago from the \nOffice of the Attorney General. Where you have one hospital buying another \nhospital or private equity in the market buying in small chunks, the Office of the \nAttorney General is not involved. \n \nMS. HOLMES: \nThe other piece is that some of the contracts are opaque so people do not know \nthey are confidential or what is contained in those contracts. This bill is making \nit explicitly clear that these are prohibited transactions under the Unfair Trade \nPractices Act. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 38 \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nIn the conceptual amendment, Exhibit Q, section 7, paragraph iii, what does it \nmean to place all members of a health care provider in the same tier of a tiered \nnetwork plan? \n \nMS. GUDIKSEN: \nWhen  insurers  want  to  use  tiered  networks,  they  often  divide  a  range  of \nproviders into different tiers with different cost-sharing; for example, the highest \nvalue or quality. They put the highest quality providers in one tier with the \nlowest cost-sharing so there would be some incentive for patients to choose \nthem. Some large health systems with a hospital, Magnetic resonance imaging \n(MRI) clinic and a lab contractually require all of these services to be placed on \nthe highest value tier even if they would not meet the quality or cost standards \non their own. This would allow an insurer to divide providers based on quality to \nthe different tiers or whatever standards they have for placing providers in tiers. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWould providers place multiple or different doctors within the same practice in \ndifferent tiers? \n \nMS. GUDIKSEN: \nTypically they would not. The one state that has this in law is Massachusetts, \nand  they  clearly  have  restrictions  on  how  the  tiers  are  divided  which  are \ntypically by facility. For example, a group practice would be in one tier, but the \nhospital itself would be in another. The MRI and out-patient clinics might be in a \nseparate tier. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nWe have a for-profit healthcare system. The group practices and hospitals have \nbusiness  negotiations  and  contracts  that  take  place  between  two  private \nentities. For a provider to ask to be put into a specific tier would be a deceptive \ntrade practice. Is that where we want to go? \n \nMS. BOND: \nWe do not want to prevent our members from being able to have health care \nmove towards high quality and high value because a contract is required and \nbecause the provider has the monopoly level control over the market. There is a \nrequirement to serve the members you are contracted with but not let that be \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 39 \n \nprohibitive from having incentives where they are able to use other providers. \nThere are contracts that do not allow this. \n \nMS. HOLMES: \nMarket  players  are  using  their  market  dominance,  which  is  their  monopoly \npayer, preventing other providers and facilities from being able to compete on \nthe basis of price and quality. The dominant provider is saying they can be in \nthe same tier even though they charge more and have lower quality. They base \nthat on the fact that they are so large they have to be in that network and can \ndemand that. \n \nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \nDoes section 8 of the bill void the currently existing contract? \n \nMS. BOND: \nNot  the  contract,  just  that  section  of  the  contract  that  is  the  monopoly \nlanguage. The rest of the contract stands. \n \nRUSTY MCALLISTER  (Nevada  State  American  Federation  of  Labor  Congress  of \nIndustrial Organization): \nThe  Nevada  State  American  Federation  of  Labor  Congress  of  Industrial \nOrganization supports S.B. 329. We believe the recording notifications regarding \nbuy-outs and mergers are essential to our members’ health plans. There have \nbeen many changes in the last five years. Mergers and buy-outs are becoming \nmore of a regular practice, and private equity has found this is a great market to \njump into. There are two emergency room groups in southern Nevada that are \nnow owned by private equity groups. One of these groups tried to terminate the \ncontract, or run out a contract of emergency rooms, simply so they could raise \nthe rates. These notifications will help us to better advise our members, and \ncontrol the cost of the limited amount of dollars we have. \n \nWe are supportive of the language that keeps providers of health care from \nhaving contracts that limit our members and plans from seeking out the best \nand most cost effective treatments that are important to them. The language in \nthese contracts creates a monopoly scenario, and that is not good use of our \nlimited health care dollars. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 40 \n \nJUSTON LARSEN: \nI am a Culinary Union member and have had asthma most of my life. I want to \nbe  an  informed  and  empowered  patient  and  need  the  information  to  better \nadvocate for myself. I trust my culinary health fund to ensure I am going to get \nthe best quality of care at the lowest price. I would like my culinary health fund \nadvocate to provide advice on where it would be best for me to go that is safe, \nwith a good medical professional and clinic that has the lowest co-pay amount. \nRight now, due to anti-steering and anti-tiering language in hospital contracts, \nmy health fund is not able to give me the complete information I need and \ndeserve.  That  is  not  right.  Removing  anticompetitive  clauses  from  hospital \ncontracts will allow my health fund to provide the complete information I need \nto meet my health needs. \n \nJAMES SULLIVAN (Culinary Health Union): \nThe Culinary Health Union supports S.B. 329 because health care affordability, \nquality  and  access  are  critical  concerns  for  culinary  union  members. \nConsolidation in the healthcare industry drives up prices but not the quality of \nour health care. Senate Bill 329 will take important steps to help understand \nhow consolidation impacts our healthcare markets. It will stop anticompetitive \ncontracting practices that prevent patients, employers and plans from shopping \nfor and getting the best deals. \n \nJAMES WADHAMS (Nevada Hospital Association): \nThe  Nevada  Hospital  Association  opposes  S.B. 329.  The  Nevada  Hospital \nAssociation  members  have  not  had  a  chance  to  review  the  conceptual \namendment, Exhibit Q. Although we are in opposition, we have committed to \ncontinue to work with Senator Lange and any other stakeholders on this bill. \n \nGEORGE ROSS (HCA Healthcare): \nAs  the  bill  is  drafted,  and  with  the  conceptual  amendment,  Exhibit  Q, \nHCA Healthcare  opposes  S.B. 329.  This  bill  would  necessitate  separate \ncontracts for each hospital, ambulatory surgery center and urgent care center. \nWe have carefully developed a system of care over many years with protocols \nand IT systems critical to organizing and coordinating care to get the right, most \neffective treatment for a person at the right time. \n \nThis bill, as written, with the amendment, Exhibit Q, would fragment care at the \nrisk of duplication of services, destruct relationships, end value-based contracts \nand most likely raise costs. \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 41 \n \nHospitals under an HCA contract with physician groups, such as emergency \nroom groups, are not exclusive contracts. These physician groups are free to \ncontract with any group they choose. \n \nOne can argue the only limits on an individual patient shopping for the best deal \nand  doctors  are  the  terms  of  his  individual  insurance  plan,  his  or  her \nout-of-network penalties, coinsurance and copays. The limitation is the narrow \nnetworks, not the providers or the hospitals. \n \nKATIE RYAN (Dignity Health - St. Rose Dominican): \nDignity Health - St. Rose Dominican opposes the original version of S.B. 329 \nand  the  conceptual  amendment,  Exhibit  Q,  for  the  reasons  cited  by  my \ncolleagues. This bill is duplicative of A.B. 47 which we have been working on \nwith the Office of the Attorney General on reporting of health care transactions. \n \nAssembly  Bill  47:  Revises  provisions  relating  to  unfair  trade  practices. \n(BDR 52-425) \n \nAlso, the contracting restrictions piece of both the original version of the bill and \nthe conceptual amendment, Exhibit Q, is problematic. It will make navigating \nhealth care coverage more difficult for patients while creating access to care \nand quality issues by interrupting the continuity of care. \n \nCHRIS BOSSE (Renown Health): \nRenown  Health  opposes  S.B.  329  as  drafted  and  the  conceptual  language \nprovided which we have had for less than 24 hours and have not been able to \ndetermine all impacts of the bill. \n \nAs an integrated delivery system, Renown Health provides value to its patients \nand  those  employer  groups  and  payers  we  contract  with  by  being  able  to \nprovide high quality care in the most cost effective setting, including the past \nyear during the Covid-19 pandemic in the patient’s home when appropriate. \nExcluding components of the delivery system we offer diminishes our ability to \nmeet patient’s needs. By connecting the components of the healthcare delivery \nsystem, we are able to coordinate care, hold components of the delivery system \naccountable to outcomes and improve communication between the levels of \ncare and the patient. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 42 \n \nSenate Bill 329 undermines components that nationally CMS has encouraged \nhealthcare  delivery  systems  to  build  through  establishing  accountable  care \norganizations  which  have  demonstrated  the  ability  to  improve  quality  and \nprovide the most cost effective care. \n \nSection 8 of the bill and the most recent amended language voids elements of \nexisting  contracts  where  rates  have  been  established  based  on  the  entire \nframework of a current contract. This places a significant hardship on hospitals \nand healthcare delivery systems in Nevada who provide a discount based on a \npredicted number of patients. This will likely result in an unprecedented volume \nof contract renegotiations where prices will have to go up to sustain services in \nan environment of significant uncompensated costs related to government and \nuninsured cared provided. \n \nDAN MUSGROVE (Valley Health System): \nValley Health System opposes S.B. 329. I echo the comments of my colleagues \nfrom  HCA  as  well  as  Renown.  The  Valley  Health  System  is  eight  hospitals \nStatewide,  soon  to  be  nine.  It  is  that  system  of  care  that  prevents \nfragmentation  and  delivers  better  care  at  a  better  cost  to  both  our  insured \npartners as well as our patients. \n \nMARGOT  CHAPPEL  (Deputy  Administrator,  Regulatory  and  Planning  Services, \nDivision  of  Public  and  Behavioral  Health,  Department  of  Health  and \nHuman Services): \nWe have reviewed the bill and there is some fiscal impact we wanted to report. \nWe will need to add staff because of the language in section 1 of the bill that \nidentifies  proposed  statute  language  where  offices  would  be  responsible  for \nsetting up the website, collecting the data and analyzing and reporting the data. \n \nJARON HILDEBRAND (Nevada State Medical Association): \nThe Nevada State Medical Association is in the neutral position on S.B. 329. \nFirst and foremost, we consider ourselves as a patient advocacy organization. \nWe received the amendment, Exhibit Q, late yesterday, and we are waiting on \nfeedback  from  our  membership.  Generally,  we  favor  transparency  and  fully \nshare the concerns of the bill sponsor regarding increasing the cost of health \ncare. Many of our practices have been crushed during the Covid-19 pandemic, \nand we know the residual effects from this have yet to be seen in our small \npractices across the State. \n \nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \nMarch 30, 2021 \nPage 43 \n \nWe have some concerns with the reporting sections at the beginning of the bill. \nMost transactions are not a concern, and it cannot be emphasized enough the \nAttorney General already has the ability to intervene when there is a reason for \nconcern. Increasing the thresholds for individual providers to a percentage of \nspecialty markets and specifying a material change, should trigger the recording \nand would reduce our concerns. Including small joint ventures and management \ncontracts, would be overwhelming and would not meet the intent of recordings. \n \nWe  are  still  reviewing  the  second  half  of  this  bill  and  are  working  to  fully \nunderstand  the  anti-steering  and  anti-tiering  provisions  that  will  affect  the \nmarket. We support competition in the market and believe patients should have \naccess to high-quality care. We do not want to take any contracting tools away \nfrom our small providers when negotiating with large corporations. \n \nSUSAN FISHER (Nevada State Society of Anesthesiologists): \nThe  Nevada  State  Society  of  Anesthesiologists  is  neutral  on  S.B. 329  with \nconcerns for the same reasons expressed by Mr. Hildebrand. We fail to see how \nthe bill will help with patient-physician relationships. We would like a better \nunderstanding of if the physician reports to one insurer what another insurer \npays them for similar services, how this will help the patient or the provider. We \nare  still  analyzing  the  conceptual  amendment,  Exhibit  Q,  and  how  this  bill \ninteracts with the Attorney General’s bill that is of a similar nature. \n \nJESSICA FERRATO (Association for Comprehensive Energy Psychology): \nThe  Association  for  Comprehensive  Energy  Psychology  (ACEP)  is  neutral  on \nS.B. 329. Health care transparency is a priority for ACEP. We are reviewing the \nchanges  from  the  conceptual  amendment,  Exhibit  Q,  and  look  forward  to \ncontinuing to work with the sponsors. \n \nLINDSAY KNOX (Nevada Orthopaedic Society): \nThe Nevada Orthopaedic Society is neutral on S.B. 329.
