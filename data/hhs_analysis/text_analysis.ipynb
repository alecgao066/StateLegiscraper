Thank \\nyou for joining us, and thank you to our virtual audience watching this online, on their \\nphones, or on any other device available to them. \\n \\nToday we have some introductions, adoption of Committee policies, and a presentation by \\nthe staff of the Department of Health and Human Services.  However, before we begin, \\nI would like to make several housekeeping announcements.  For those who do not know, the \\nAssembly  Committee  on  Health  and  Human  Services  is  scheduled  to  meet  Mondays, \\nWednesdays, and Fridays at 1:30 p.m.  I will plan to start on time, so I have asked people to \\ngo online early, especially in this virtual setting, because we always have some difficulties.   \\n \\nThis is a virtual meeting format and meant to keep us safe during the COVID-19 pandemic, \\nbut I also see it as an opportunity for members of the public to provide testimony in a variety \\nof different ways which they may not have been able to utilize in the past.  Hopefully, as we \\neventually move to a situation where we are meeting in person and taking testimony in \\nperson, we will still allow some of the public to participate in the new ways we have \\ndeveloped around the COVID-19 protocol. \\n \\nIn addition, any written documentation and committee exhibits can be viewed electronically.  \\nYou can also email Abigail Lee, our committee manager, by noon the day before the meeting \\nif you would like to submit anything in writing.   \\n \\nI am asking all Committee members to please keep their cameras on unless they need to step \\naway from this meeting.  If you do step away, please let Vice Chair Peters or me know.  That \\nwould be greatly appreciated. \\n \\nThere will be an orderly flow of discussion.  If you have comments or questions or responses, \\nplease have them come through me.  There are multiple ways we can communicate.  If you \\nwant to send a message to me via Skype, I will recognize you so you can speak, or raise your \\nhand if you are having difficulty with Skype.  We will try to be as flexible as possible.  \\nI know Vice Chair Peters will also be looking to see if people are motioning that they have a \\ncomment or would like to say something. \\n \\nI would like to begin with the introduction of Committee members and staff.  I will start with \\nmembers of the Committee.  Will you briefly introduce yourselves, beginning with my friend \\nand Vice Chair, Assemblywoman Peters. \\n \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 3, 2021 \\nPage 3 \\n \\nAssemblywoman Peters: \\nI am really looking forward to serving on this Committee, particularly with Assemblywoman \\nNguyen as Chair.  I think this is going to be a really great session to talk about issues that \\ncome into this Health and Human Services. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \\nI am very excited to be returning to the Health and Human Services Committee.  I have \\nserved on it all my sessions except for the last session.  I am happy to be back here, as this is \\none of my favorite subjects. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Titus: \\nI am excited, Madam Chair, to see that you are the Chair of this Committee, and your passion \\nfor all Nevadans is exciting.  I am Robin Titus and I am a family physician with thirty-five-\\nplus years of experience in the office.  I also have lots of emergency room experience and \\nI am a long-term medical care director.  I gave up those hats, however, so I could be here.  \\nThe only thing I am currently involved with medically is as the Lyon County health officer. \\n \\nI represent rural Nevada, District 38, so a number of rural health care issues have been \\npassions of mine and I look forward to solving the problems concerning health care access \\nthroughout this state—not just in the rurals, but in urban settings as well.  I think health care \\nhas always been a topic that has a wide range of bipartisan support.  There is not a person on \\nthis Committee who does not recognize that health care is critical to all Nevadans, regardless \\nof where they are.  I am excited about the makeup of this Committee, and I am excited to be \\nback.  This will be my fourth time on this Committee.  I look forward to solving some of the \\nissues here in the state of Nevada regarding health care.  I am happy to be part of the \\nconversation. \\n \\nAssemblyman Hafen: \\nI represent District 36, and this is my second session on the Health and Human Services \\nCommittee.  I agree with what everyone else has said, and I am excited to be here.  There is a \\nlot of hard work ahead of us. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \\nI represent Assembly District 35 in the southwest part of Las Vegas.  In my day job, I work \\nfor a local nonprofit organization that provides health care to children.  We emphasize \\nchildren with special health care needs.  Prior to that, I worked with maternal and child health \\ncare issues, so health care has been very near and dear to my heart for the majority of my \\ncareer.  I am really excited to be serving my second session on the Health and Human \\nServices Committee and look forward to continuing the hard work we did during the interim \\nand last session. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Krasner: \\nIt is a pleasure to be here with all of you.  I represent Assembly District 26, which is south \\nReno  and  Incline  Village.    I  served  on  the  Health  and  Human  Services  Committee  \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 3, 2021 \\nPage 4 \\n \\nduring the 2019 Legislative Session and I am very happy to be back again.  I am looking  \\nforward to creating legislation that helps the people of the state of Nevada and improves their \\nlives. \\n \\nAssemblyman Orentlicher: \\nI represent Assembly District 20 on the east side of Las Vegas, Paradise, and into northwest \\nHenderson.  My background is in medicine and law, and I teach at the University of Nevada, \\nLas Vegas (UNLV) William S. Boyd School of Law—medicine, health law, constitutional \\nlaw.  I have spent a good part of the last several years thinking about how we can improve \\nour health care system.  This is my first time on this Health and Human Services Committee, \\nbut I served six years on the Public Health Committee in the Indiana Legislature about fifteen \\nyears ago.  I am looking forward to working with everyone. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \\nI am the Assemblywoman for District 6.  I am happy to be here and excited to help in any \\nway I can to advance good policy that will assist the folks in my community and all across \\nthe state of Nevada. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Thomas: \\nI represent Assembly District 17 in North Las Vegas.  I am a retired U.S. Air Force veteran \\nand extremely happy to be on this Committee.  I look forward to addressing some of the \\nissues involving our veterans and elders in the state of Nevada. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Black: \\nI  represent  Assembly  District  19.    I  am  a  Realtor,  but  I  am  married  to  a  medical \\nprofessional—a neurophysiologist.  We have just started a medical business, so I am curious \\nand interested to hear what we will be talking about in this Committee.  I hope I can bring \\nsome good feedback to the group. \\n \\nAssemblyman Matthews: \\nI represent Assembly District 37 in the northwestern part of the City of Las Vegas.  This is \\nmy first legislative session.  It is an honor to be here and I look forward to serving with all of \\nyou and working on this very important issue. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nThis is my second session on the Health and Human Services Committee.  It is my first as \\nChair of this Committee, a role that I am truly humbled and honored to serve in during this \\nsession.  However, the role I am most proud of is mother to my two children—my ten-year-\\nold  son,  Henry,  and  my  eight-year-old  daughter,  Hannah.    My  husband  is  wonderfully \\nsupportive, as are my father, Thang, and my father-in-law, Dale, plus our puppy.  I grew up \\nin a multigenerational family.  I now have that in my house, and that is what I bring to this \\nCommittee.  We all have challenges we face in the area of health care such as access, and \\nI am dealing with it personally with my children and with my elderly parents.  I know there \\nare a lot of policies we all care about that will affect families like our own and, hopefully, we  \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 3, 2021 \\nPage 5 \\n \\ncan talk about them here.  With all the unique challenges that the last year has brought, I am \\nalways inspired by the fighting spirit that Nevadans have.  It is what kept me here after \\nI moved here in 1999 and why I have not left.   \\n \\nWe would not be able to be here without the amazing staff we have in this Health and Human \\nServices Committee, and now I am going to introduce them.  We have Abigail Lee, who goes \\nby Gail and is our committee manager.  She was born, raised, and educated in the Philippines \\nand has a bachelor\\'s degree in business administration.  Before working in the Assembly, she \\nlived in the Washington, D.C., area and worked in the private sector—most recently as a \\nbusiness operations manager at a Fortune 500 company.  She has also held leadership roles in \\naviation and in the hospitality industry and moved to Carson City in 2019.  She is the mother \\nof two boys—David, age eight, and Daniel, age six.  Outside of work, she spends a lot of \\ntime  volunteering,  plus  hiking,  snorkeling,  and  running,  and  she  has  a  passion  for  the \\nperforming arts. \\n \\nAbigail Lee, Committee Manager: \\nGood afternoon.  It is good to be here. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nWe also welcome Terry Horgan, our committee secretary.  She has lived in Carson City since \\n1975, is a retired bookkeeper, and has worked as a committee secretary for many legislative \\nsessions, primarily on the Committee on Health and Human Services.  She tells me that she \\nloves her job. \\n \\nTerry Horgan, Committee Secretary: \\nHello, everyone. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nIf you want to have a meeting with me or you just want to contact me, my personal attaché is \\nDielle Telada.  She is a proud Nevada native and a UNLV graduate.  During the 2019 \\nLegislative Session she worked as a legislative intern in the Assembly leadership office and \\nmost recently graduated from UNLV with her bachelor of arts degree in political science.  \\nShe is currently working on her master\\'s degree in public administration, also at the UNLV \\nSchool of Public Policy and Leadership.  Prior to the start of the 81st Session, she worked on \\ntwo  presidential  campaigns  and  served  on  two  executive  boards,  including  the  Young \\nDemocrats of Nevada as the director of expansion, and as second vice chair for the Asian \\nAmerican & Pacific Islander (AAPI) Democratic Caucus.  She is also helping with our \\nnonpartisan AAPI Legislative Caucus handling some of the cultural events we have planned. \\n \\nTrinity Thom is the committee assistant for the Committees on Health and Human Services \\n(HHS),  Growth  and  Infrastructure,  Legislative  Operations  and  Elections,  and  Natural \\nResources.  This is her fourth legislative session and second time on HHS.  She is an enrolled \\nmember of the Walker River Paiute Tribe and she enjoys traveling and playing softball in her \\nfree time. \\n \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 3, 2021 \\nPage 6 \\n \\nNext, we will go to some of our nonpartisan staff.  Our committee counsel is Karly O\\'Krent. \\n \\nKarly O\\'Krent, Senior Deputy Legislative Counsel: \\nI am an attorney with the Legal Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau, so I will be your \\ncounsel for this Committee.  This is my fifth legislative session and my second session \\nstaffing HHS.  In the years prior, I staffed the Education Committee.  Most of you are \\nfamiliar with the services that committee counsel offer, but if you are not, I will be helping \\nwith answering questions regarding bills the Committee is hearing.  I am happy to answer \\nquestions offline as well.  I can also help with preparing amendments or mock-ups as those \\narise. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nFinally, I am going to let Patrick Ashton, our committee policy analyst, introduce himself. \\n \\nPatrick B. Ashton, Senior Policy Analyst: \\nI work as a senior policy analyst with the Research Division of the Legislative Counsel \\nBureau (LCB).  This is my second session with the Legislature.  Last session I staffed the \\nAssembly Commerce and Labor Committee.  During the 2019-2020 Interim, I staffed the \\nLegislative Committee on Health Care for some meetings and the Committee to Conduct an \\nInterim Study Concerning the Costs of Prescription Drugs.   \\n \\nI hold two master\\'s degrees from the University of Nevada, Reno—one in political science, \\nthe other in social work.  I am also a licensed social worker and worked for the Aging and \\nDisability Services Division of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) \\nbefore joining the LCB.  I am originally from Munich, Bavaria, in Germany, and since 2009 \\nI have been living in Nevada for most of the time.  I am really honored to serve as your \\ncommittee policy analyst, and I am looking forward to working with all of you.   \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nKarly  O\\'Krent  and  Patrick  Ashton  are  valuable  resources  for  all  the  members  on  this \\nCommittee,  so  please  reach  out  to  them  as  you  are  looking  through  bills  if  you  have \\nquestions about them.  Patrick and Karly are here to help all of us on the Committee \\nunderstand and get through the sometimes very complex nature of working through these bill \\ndraft  requests  as  we  are  going  through  the  session,  so  please  take  advantage  of  their \\nknowledge and resources.  They are fantastic people as well. \\n \\nOur first order of business today is the adoption of the Committee policies [Exhibit C].  They \\nwere posted on the Legislature\\'s website and I believe we had the opportunity to also email \\nthem to Committee members.  They are policies I am sure you have probably all voted on; \\nthey are very similar to those approved in other committees.  They serve as a complement to \\nthe Assembly Standing Rules and the Joint Standing Rules we adopted as a legislative body \\non Monday in the full Assembly.   \\n \\nDue to the virtual format of some of our meetings, some additional virtual meeting policies \\nhave been added.  Are there any questions or comments regarding those policies?  I do not \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 3, 2021 \\nPage 7 \\n \\nsee any, so I will entertain a motion at this time to adopt the Committee policies for the \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services. \\n \\nASSEMBLYWOMAN PETERS MOVED TO ADOPT THE COMMITTEE \\nPOLICIES  FOR  THE  ASSEMBLY  COMMITTEE  ON  HEALTH  AND \\nHUMAN SERVICES. \\n \\nASSEMBLYWOMAN TITUS SECONDED THE MOTION. \\n \\nTHE MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY. \\n \\nThis next document was on the Nevada Electronic Legislative Information System (NELIS) \\nand was probably also provided to you in an email.  I will have our committee policy analyst \\npresent the Committee Brief [Exhibit D].   \\n \\nPatrick Ashton: \\nBefore I start, I have a little reminder that as non-partisan legislative staff I cannot advocate \\nor oppose any of the proposals that come before you.  I am here to assist the Chair and \\nmembers with any questions concerning policies that may arise.  My only agenda is to be \\nobjective and provide you with unbiased information.  I am available to assist the Committee \\nand its members on any issues related to health and human services.  In addition, the \\nResearch Division is available to provide information and assistance on a confidential basis \\nto individual members of the Legislature on any topic.  Please feel free to reach out to me or \\nany of my colleagues at any time. \\n \\nYou have all been provided with an electronic copy of the Committee Brief, and you can also \\nfind a copy on NELIS.  This brief provides background information on the work of the \\nCommittee and policy issues that you may consider this session. \\n \\nDuring the 2019 Legislative Session, this Committee considered a total of 46 Assembly and \\n41 Senate bills and resolutions for a total of 87 measures [page 3, Exhibit D].  Seventy-four \\nof these were voted out of the Committee and the Legislature approved 68 measures.  That \\nmeans that, of the original 87 measures, over three-quarters of them were signed into law.  \\nThough it appears this Committee was quite busy last session, let us see what may happen \\nthis session. \\n \\nPlease turn to the next four pages [pages 4-7].  For the next four months, we can expect \\nhearings about many health and human services issues in this Committee, in the Assembly \\nWays and Means Committee, or on the floor of the Assembly.  The pandemic caused by the \\ncoronavirus disease of 2019, COVID-19, will dominate any measures you will consider this \\nsession either directly or indirectly.  For example, you might consider matters related to \\npublic health, behavioral health and substance use, access to health care, and prescription \\ndrug costs, just to highlight a few of them.  The Committee Brief provides background \\ninformation on these highlights.  In the next couple of weeks, we will also hear additional \\npresentations from experts on public health, mental health, and Medicaid. \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 3, 2021 \\nPage 8 \\n \\nI would like to note that a correction in the brief in the Behavioral Health and Substance Use \\nPrevention section [page 5, Exhibit D].  The first sentence of that section stated, \"More than a \\nquarter of adults in Nevada have a mental health disorder . . . .\"  That is incorrect.  Instead, it \\nshould read, \"More than one-fifth of adults in Nevada have a mental health disorder . . . .\"  \\nActually, it is 20.7 percent, to be exact.  You will find an updated Committee Brief uploaded \\non the Committee\\'s web page.   \\n \\nOn the next two pages [pages 8 and 9] you will find an overview of relevant audits, reports, \\nand studies such as interim committee bulletins that summarize the work of committees and \\nstudies during the past interim; reports from certain issues that the Legislative Committee on \\nHealth Care studied; and legislative audits from the Legislative Counsel Bureau\\'s Audit \\nDivision.  The Committee Brief contains hyperlinks to the reports and bulletins if you would \\nlike to dig deeper into certain issues.  \\n \\nFinally, you will find a separate document in your meeting materials that lists relevant state \\nand local agency contacts [Exhibit E].  The agencies included are those that are likely to \\ncome  before  this  Committee  at  some  point  during  this  session.    This  concludes  my \\npresentation, and I welcome any questions you may have. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nDoes anyone have any questions for Patrick at this time?  I do not see any.  As I said, he is an \\ninvaluable  resource  to  our  Committee.    He  is  there  to  answer  all  your  questions  in  a \\nstraightforward way.  I appreciate all his help in getting ready for today, and I look forward \\nto working with him for the rest of the session, as I am sure you all will. \\n \\nWe will now move into our only presentation today.  I asked Director Whitley to present a \\nvery broad overview of the Department of Health and Human Services.  A tremendous \\namount of our state budget is related to health care.  We have a wonderful director who \\nmanages all this, and I will ask him to introduce himself.  Keep in mind that we do have \\nother presentations coming up that will provide more detailed discussions about some of the \\nagencies within the Department of Health and Human Services. \\n \\nRichard Whitley, Director, Department of Health and Human Services: \\nI am grateful that the Chair has allowed us to take some deeper dives into aspects of health \\nand human services such as Nevada Medicaid, behavioral health, and a focus on the state\\'s \\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic. \\n \\nI plan to show you a few slides, starting with this one [page 2, Exhibit F] which references \\nour Department\\'s authority and mission.  We have a population-based approach to health care \\nand  a  public  health  approach  to  prevention  and  intervention.    The  next  slide  [page  3] \\nsummarizes how the Department is organized into five divisions as shown in the gray boxes.  \\nThey are framed around populations served, such as Aging and Disability Services and Child \\nand Family Services; and functions, such as Public and Behavioral Health, Welfare and \\nSupportive Services, and Nevada Medicaid.  Each of the divisions comes equipped with all \\nthe standard bureaucratic components—personnel, information technology, and financing. \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 3, 2021 \\nPage 9 \\n \\nThe next slide [page 4, Exhibit F] represents the total number of full-time staff in the \\nDepartment.  The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) employs a staff of \\nover 6,000 and the majority work in a direct service capacity.  This session, there is a request \\nfor 288 additional staff—primarily due to caseload growth in various programs. \\n \\nThe budget is shown on the next slide [page 5].  For fiscal years 2022 and 2023, DHHS \\nrepresents 48 percent of the state\\'s total budget; that represents all the funding sources, both \\nfrom the state\\'s General Fund and from the federal match.  Within the DHHS budget, \\nMedicaid represents 78 percent of the total amount spent.  You can see that DHHS has the \\nlargest spend of any single state agency, and that spend is primarily in Nevada Medicaid. \\n \\nTo frame the high-level overview, I would like to go back to talking about our structure \\n[page 3].  When you look at our programs, you have to look at them in the context of how we \\noperationalize them in the community and what our role is.  Our role includes the direct \\ndelivery of service, the funding of service, and the regulating or enforcement of service \\ndelivery.  So we have all three of these components, and sometimes they exist in a single \\nprogram.  For example, in public health we only have two local health districts in our state—\\nthe Washoe County Health District and the Southern Nevada Health District.  The remainder \\nof the state falls under DHHS for public health.  We do have a quad-county collaborative led \\nby Carson City, but that is not a health district.  We are one of the few states in the nation \\nthat have this model where the state assumes some direct responsibilities for public health. \\n \\nSocial services are another area.  There are county social services in every county, but they \\nplay very different roles.  In Clark and Washoe Counties, child welfare is delivered at the \\ncounty level, but for the remainder of the state, the state has oversight for child welfare.  This \\nmakes for a challenge sometimes because the same oversight for direct service delivery is \\nalso oversight for the entire state.  So sometimes we are partners, but sometimes we are \\nenforcement or regulatory in terms of a statewide system.  This is also true in mental health.  \\nThe state never formally transitioned, as other states did, from state-operated mental health to \\ncounty-operated mental health to community-operated mental health, or certainly not at the \\npace the rest of the nation did decades ago.  Until the expansion of Medicaid, the state was \\nthe  single  largest  provider  of  behavioral  health  services.    The  transition  to  a  more \\ncommunity-based strategy has really developed with the expansion of Medicaid, allowing \\nconsumers to have a choice about where they go to get services, and with the legislation that \\ncreated the regional behavioral health boards.  Before the expansion of Medicaid, we were \\none of only three states that operated behavioral health with the state being the primary care \\nprovider.  In Medicaid, this model is primarily a managed care model in Clark and Washoe \\nCounties and a fee-for-service model in rural Nevada.  Additionally, there are populations \\nsuch as the blind, aged, and disabled that are in a fee-for-service environment. \\n \\nThe service delivery approach is really complex and costly, both in terms of the vulnerable \\npopulations that are served as well as the actual financial cost for that delivery.  While trying \\nto reduce the number of people who are uninsured, for the past four or five years we have \\nstruggled to really implement health care in an environment that has been made difficult by \\nthe notion of repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and even affecting the \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 3, 2021 \\nPage 10 \\n \\nexpansion of Medicaid.  As we moved forward to mature our health care system, we had a lot \\nof  challenges  along  the  way,  further  complicated  this  past  year  with  the  COVID-19 \\npandemic. \\n \\nIt is important to note that this was already a very fragile environment, due primarily to the \\nfact that much of our state is a health care workforce shortage area; access to primary care, \\nspecialty services, and even health facilities such as long-term care and hospitals remain very \\nvulnerable in some communities.  \\n \\nDuring the pandemic we have had challenges, but we have also had opportunities identified.  \\nWe may have moved more quickly or taken bigger or bolder steps to be responsive than we \\nwould have otherwise, but some of these things are too good not to build off of as we go \\nforward.  For example, telehealth has really increased access,  especially in the area of \\nbehavioral health.  That is largely due to the groundwork that legislators did on framing \\ntelehealth.  We were pretty much ready to go with the implementation, including with \\nMedicaid, and that allowed us to continue with service provisions during the pandemic. \\n \\nA second opportunity is the expansion of the scope of practice.  A good example of that is \\npharmacists and pharmacy techs as immunizers.  A lot of focus is on the workforce shortage \\nareas.  I am happy to share with you, or you can browse around on our website, that we have \\na Primary Care Office.  It does the assessment of the shortage areas for the United States \\nDepartment of Health and Human Services.  Those shortage areas then become vehicles for \\napplication  for  funding  to  become  federally  qualified  health  centers  or  for  health  care \\nworkers for loan repayments.  Much of our state is a workforce shortage area as it relates to \\nhealth care, but the challenge of producing more doctors and nurses is just that—a challenge.  \\nHowever, we have seen some improvement in terms of broadening the scope of practice of \\nsome of the existing disciplines.  Discussions are always tense when it comes to licensing \\nboards and scopes of practice, but I think we have seen some benefit, especially in the area of \\nvaccinators. \\n \\nThe third area we have seen an opportunity for growth in is data analytics.  Those of you who \\nsit on the budget committee will note that one of the few moves we are making within our \\nDepartment this legislative session is the request to move data analytics under my office.  \\nData analytics, much like financing, is usually categorical.  We have programs that may \\ncome with a federal grant and have all the bells and whistles for data analytics, and then we \\nhave other programs that are largely reliant on the State General Fund that have very little in \\nterms of capability for data analytics.  I am most proud of the work of Kyra Morgan, our state \\nbiostatistician.  If you look on the website for the COVID-19 tracker, Nevada early on scored \\nan A+ compared to other states with our transparency and data, largely due to the work of our \\nstate biostatistician and her staff.  It is not just data for the sake of data, but it is really the \\nanalytics of the data that serves to inform us.  We have utilized that data daily as it relates to \\nwho is being tested, who is not being tested, where we are seeing outbreaks, and where to \\ntarget our limited resources.  I did not want this to just be an event that occurred with \\nCOVID-19, because bringing the analytics together and sharing some best practices as well \\nas sharing the dashboarding is really rich. \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 3, 2021 \\nPage 11 \\n \\nIf you go on the main page of the DHHS website and you look on the right-hand side under \\n\"Nevada Health Profiles,\" Kyra created a data dashboard by districts and counties.  You can \\npull up your legislative districts and look at the health indicators for the people you represent.  \\nYou can also find the health care coverage, the uninsured rate, the insured rate by payer \\nsource, and demographics.  It is a really rich tool.  That is one thing that has come out of the \\npandemic that I intend to keep pushing.  We rarely ask for general funds related to data \\nanalytics because the service line is generally so long.  We know where the need is—in \\nbehavioral  health  and  substance  abuse—so  the  idea  that  we  would  pull  resources  for \\nanalytics has been too tough to put forward.  But I do think in this organizational structure, \\nwithout costing any more money, we have the ability to share the knowledge and capabilities \\nfor data analytics. \\n \\nI had a great conversation earlier this week with Joan Hall, Executive Director of Nevada \\nRural Health Partners, the association of rural hospitals—most of which are critical access \\nhospitals.  On her web page, you need only look at the tool box she created for data reporting \\nfor rural hospitals.  Now hospitals know what they need to report, but what you do not see is \\nwhat we do with all that data—how we translate that to information that is actionable.  With \\nthis look at data analytics, I am hopeful that I can come before you next session with some \\nrecommendations—perhaps even changing some of the reporting requirements.  There is a \\ntendency sometimes in government to pile on requirements without pausing to see whether \\nthose requirements still serve the same purpose, or whether there might now be other ways to \\nget at the intended goal.  This is illustrated very clearly when it comes to data collection.  \\nAnd then what do we do with it?  If we collect it, I believe we should do something with it \\nthat would inform on strategies for how to either make improvements or go upstream and \\nprevent a costly health outcome.  \\n \\nThose are a few things I wanted to highlight which are the silver lining in our need to do \\nwork differently.  As Chair Nguyen said, you will get a deeper dive into Medicaid.  Our \\nfinancing  of  Medicaid  is  historically  dependent  upon  the  counties,  the  taxing.    When \\nexpanded, we did not change the way we funded it.  Most of you who were serving during \\nthe  special  session  know  that  we  initially  came  before  the  legislative  body  with  some \\ndramatic reductions because the economy could not continue to support the level of services. \\nOur financing of health care is fragile.  We have opportunities with provider fees that are \\noptional, but we have not had any providers take advantage of that other than what is \\nrequired in statute for managed care and skilled nursing facilities to pay fees.  I feel as though \\nour agency had good momentum coming out of the last session, but we have really had to \\nfocus.  It has been all hands on deck related to the COVID-19 pandemic. \\n \\nOne other highlight I should mention is our oversight of health care.  If you have been around \\nduring the last decade, you know that Nevada had a large exposure to hepatitis C in an \\nambulatory surgery center in Las Vegas.  It has been ten years, but one thing that came out of \\nthat horrible event was that we embedded facility epidemiologists, disease investigators, into \\nour regulatory agency—the Bureau of Health Care Quality and Compliance.  I am very proud \\nof the work Margot Chappel and Lisa Sherych have done to ensure that our health facilities \\nare safe.   We  have  had  tragedies,  we  have had  deaths,  but  when you  look at  Nevada \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 3, 2021 \\nPage 12 \\n \\ncompared to other states, we rank among the lowest.  We are responsive when there is an \\noutbreak, whether connected with employee training, lack of equipment, or policy.  We are \\nquick to get in, identify the problem, and find solutions. \\n \\nI am very proud of our regulatory environment and that it is not regulatory in isolation.  It is \\nregulatory that enters from the belief that we share the same goal—to be compliant.  I have \\nnot seen other states operate in this way and not even the federal government where the \\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services\\' regulatory arm operates in a silo.  I am quite \\nproud,  and  it  was  demonstrated  once  again  in  the  effectiveness  of  the  work  with  our \\nregulators to keep our most vulnerable protected in health facilities. \\n \\nAnother slide [page 6, Exhibit F] lists the bill drafts from our Department that will, for \\nthe most  part,  be  appearing  before  you  in  this  Committee.    That  concludes  my  formal \\npresentation, and I am happy to answer any questions.  I am also happy to speak with any of \\nyou who have bills.  As you see in our organizational chart, we have touchpoints to a vast \\nvariety of issues surrounding health care such as financing it, regulating it, and delivering it \\nto all populations.  What usually happens in the Legislature is that something may be a great \\nidea until it gets a fiscal note, and then the fiscal note becomes the stall.  What I have found \\nwhen we reach out to legislators about what they are trying to do is that sometimes the \\nprogram may be something we already have, although not in that context.  If you have an \\ninterest in an area that would help people, and we have a piece of the program or the \\ncomponents of it, we might be able to work together. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nThat was a wonderful presentation, as always.  Assemblywoman Titus mentioned that you \\nhave  amazing  historical  knowledge  since  you  have  been  in  this  position  for  a  while.  \\nReaching out to you, I felt we put a lot on your plate, but I appreciate your willingness to be \\nable to make health care accessible and affordable.  One philosophy I have in life and here in \\nthe Legislature is that if there is a problem, does the bill actually solve that problem?  I think \\nwhat you said is very important:  sometimes there are already solutions out there; sometimes \\nthere are already laws out there; sometimes there are already programs out there. \\n \\nThat leads to the first question I have for you.  On your organizational chart, you showed five \\nmain divisions of DHHS.  We always focus on specifics to health care services, but can you \\ntouch more on the other social services managed through DHHS?  How many different \\nprograms are there within those five main divisions? \\n \\nRichard Whitley: \\nOne that does not get a lot of focus is the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services \\n(DWSS).  That is the eligibility engine for multiple services.  I would like to applaud the staff \\nwho work in that program.  They are mostly frontline eligibility workers, some of whom \\nwere consumers of those services at one time.  Administrator Steve Fisher has created \\na pipeline for opportunity for people who may be recipients of some of the services to \\nbecome employees.  I am very proud of the work they do in eligibility.  The welfare division \\nprovided staff to the Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation during its \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 3, 2021 \\nPage 13 \\n \\nstruggles with the application process.  The reason for this is that Welfare and Supportive \\nServices has an integrated model for eligibility, so it is an engine that populates whether it is \\nMedicaid  or  the  Supplemental  Nutrition  Assistance  Program  (SNAP)  or  the  Temporary \\nAssistance for Needy Families.  Those are all programs, but they have different financial \\neligibilities.  Temporary Assistance for Needy Families has the lowest eligibility—about 100 \\npercent of poverty.  Interestingly, during this pandemic we have seen the caseload in that \\nprogram go down.  It was lower than what was projected during the last legislative session.  \\nHowever, in programs like Medicaid and SNAP we have an increase in the eligibility.  From \\na government standpoint, what is most important about this work is how they do it.  They do \\nit with a single electronic application, so if people are eligible for other programs, there are \\nprompts to complete the application so they do not have to get in multiple lines.   \\n \\nThe Division of Welfare and Supportive Services went through a lean process and has a \\nmodel called \"One and Done.\"  When a consumer approaches them with a need, their \\neligibility staff are able to help those people meet their need with their application and \\ncomplete the service.  Prior to this, if you wanted to apply for a categorical program you had \\nto get in the categorical line.  If there were errors, you had to start over.  I hold this up as an \\nefficiency in government that many other programs in other departments could benefit from \\nlooking at. \\n \\nWith food security and nutrition as determinants of health, DWSS touches that area through \\nSNAP as well as our Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program.  Food security during the \\npandemic has become a real focus area for people who have never had to access these \\nsupports in the past.  A lot of people have needed assistance navigating how to get access, \\nand then there is the need among older Nevadans to remove some of the stigma.  If I could, \\nI would change the title of DWSS.  The term \"welfare\" puts some elderly or senior folks off \\nin terms of accessing services such as food.  Senior meal programs are operated in the Aging \\nand Disability Services Division—Meals on Wheels—and have become even more important \\nas senior centers closed because of the risks and more meals are being delivered.  Our major \\npartner  in  that  program—Catholic  Charities  of  Southern  Nevada—really  expanded  its \\nprovision of in-home food delivery.  What has been helpful during the pandemic is getting \\nsome waivers so people could get food delivered.  Imagine a single mom on WIC:  on the \\npublic health side, we ask the mom to stay at home because of COVID-19, yet her children \\nneed access to food.  We have had waivers approved by the federal government to be able to \\nhave delivery as well as pickup for some of our food programs.   That also helps our \\neconomy in retail terms with the ability to make sales.   \\n \\nIn  terms  of  food  security, those  programs  run  across  our  divisions  but  definitely  work \\ntogether.  You might have one family that has a grandmother and a few young kids living \\nwith them, and they may qualify for multiple programs.  We work across our divisions to \\norganize that and make sure there are prompts for eligibility to any of the programs.  Food \\nsecurity has become more of a focus.  Food and housing are probably the two areas where \\npeople reach out with the greatest vulnerability. \\n \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 3, 2021 \\nPage 14 \\n \\nConcerning application and enrollment, there has been a gradual increase.  In talking with \\npeople who enroll, their health care is not their primary need.  If you think about it, they are \\nlikely not disabled; they had been working but then they were laid off.  It is only when health \\ncare becomes a need that some of the folks who had been laid off have been enrolling, so that \\nhas been a gradual increase.  We have seen more of a spike in applications for SNAP.  I have \\nillustrated some programs across divisions beyond health care, but I would call these all \\ndeterminants of health—poverty, housing, food security. \\n \\nWe have also been enriched by our working relationship with the schools.  I am so proud of \\nour relationship with the Superintendent of Public Instruction.  We have reached out to the \\nschool districts concerning how to meet some of the behavioral health challenges of kids who \\nare being homeschooled and who might need additional help.  The same goes for victims of \\ncrime and some of the services people need in that area.   \\n \\nI venture to say that if it is a social service program, we have a touchpoint to it.  In all these \\nareas we look for parity of service.  If we are underserving a population or if there is \\noverrepresentation, it is helpful to be able to see what is going on and if we could go \\nupstream and address the problem.  In our state, we have a lot of food deserts.  It may be one \\nof the weaknesses in the United States Department of Agriculture programs such as SNAP \\nthat a liquor store can sell some groceries and qualify to be a SNAP provider, but that might \\nbe the only source for retail purchase of food in a neighborhood.  I have identified that as an \\narea we could improve on as relates to the food deserts.  There are some models in WIC.  For \\ninstance, in Chicago there are mobile WIC stores that go to neighborhoods.  We have had \\nsome meetings with Catholic Charities about opportunities in that area.  To come full circle, \\nI want to again say food security probably is a pressing topic right now.   \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nThank you.  I appreciate your ability to see some of the challenges we have had with this \\npandemic and that you are using the pandemic as an opportunity to streamline and cut \\nthrough some of the bureaucratic red tape we have getting these services to the individuals \\nwho need them.  I appreciate your willingness to be flexible and streamline the access to \\nservices and also your willingness to share this with us.   \\n \\nDoes anyone have any questions?  I do not see any.  Director Whitley is a resource, and \\ncontact information for the various divisions and agencies is available on NELIS as well, or \\nour staff can get it to you.   \\n \\nI will move on to public comment.  As a reminder, you can always provide public comment \\nin writing to the committee secretary.  I think there is one person in the public comment \\nqueue.  [There was no one.] \\n \\nAre there other comments from Committee members before we adjourn? \\n \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 3, 2021 \\nPage 15 \\n \\nAssemblywoman  Titus:  Thank  you  for  the  presentation  from  Director  Whitley.    The \\ninstitutional knowledge he has to offer concerning how we got to this point and what brought \\nus here is quite valuable to all of us.  I would encourage you to reach out to him.  If he does \\nnot know the answer, someone in his Department will know.  Getting the history so we do \\nnot have to repeat it concerning some of these programs that may or may not have worked is \\nvaluable.  It is a big lift for the state of Nevada.  The biggest budget item is health care, so we \\nreally need to understand where we send those monies, and Director Whitley is a great \\nresource.  \\nChair Nguyen: \\nI completely agree.  Are there any other comments or concerns?  [There was no response.]  \\nThat concludes our meeting for today.  Our next meeting is Monday, February 8.

We are going to take a deeper \\ndive into some of the state agencies, so we will turn this over to the Division of Public and \\nBehavioral Health in the Department of Health and Human Services.  \\n \\nLisa Sherych, Administrator, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, Department of \\nHealth and Human Services: \\nSeveral of us will be sharing today\\'s presentation [Exhibit C].   Moving to our first slide \\n[page 2, Exhibit C], this provides an overview of our division\\'s vision and mission.  The next \\nslide [page 3] provides an overview of our division\\'s organizational chart, and the subsequent \\nslide [page 4] provides an overview of our agency\\'s operations.  As you can see, we are \\ncomposed of five service branches—community health, regulatory and planning, clinical, \\nbehavioral health policy, and administrative services.   \\n \\nThe next two slides [pages 5 and 6] provide an overview of our public health program, and \\nthe next three slides [pages 7-9] provide an overview of our division\\'s accomplishments.  Of \\nnote, I am particularly proud of the work the Division of Public and Behavioral Health has \\ncontinued to do related to addressing COVID-19\\'s spread within Nevada\\'s licensed facilities.  \\nComparing  the  national  average  of  the  percentage  of  deaths  in  facilities,  Nevada  has \\nconsistently been under 25 percent, whereas the approximate national average is 40 percent, \\nwith some states as high as 80 percent.  Additionally, Nevada has been under 20 percent \\nsince August and, as of today, we are at 15.8 percent.  That is 1.5 percent lower than it was a \\ncouple of weeks ago.  The next slide [page 10] provides information on our division\\'s public \\nhealth priorities.  Now I will turn it over to Julia Peek who will provide a further overview of \\nour presentation. \\n \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 8, 2021 \\nPage 3 \\n \\nJulia Peek, Deputy Administrator, Community Health Services, Division of Public and \\nBehavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services: \\nOne  of  the  easiest  ways  to  understand  public  health  is  to  understand  the  historical \\naccomplishments in the field.  I have provided a link in the PowerPoint of ten great public \\nhealth achievements [page 11].  I will note the top five which the Centers for Disease Control \\nand Prevention (CDC) notes as:  vaccination; motor vehicle safety; safer workplaces, which \\nis related to safety in mining, manufacturing, and construction; control of infectious diseases, \\nwhich includes clean water and sanitation; and decline in deaths from coronary heart disease \\nand  stroke.    This  centers  around  risk  modification  including  smoking  cessation,  blood \\npressure control, early detection, and better treatment.  The report goes on to list another five \\naccomplishments that range from maternal and child health to other areas.  I encourage \\nanyone interested to access the link that has been provided.  That said, even in this top five, \\nyou can see the great diversity in scope and responsibility of our public health partners. \\n \\nThis next slide [page 12, Exhibit C] is a diagram we commonly use to show the public health \\nsystem.  It illustrates the diversity of our partnerships in place to address and improve the \\nhealth of our residents.  Depending on the issue at hand to tackle, the specific partners we \\nwork with can vary.  For example, with COVID-19, there is not one partner on this diagram \\nwe have not worked with to address it in our state. \\n \\nGoing to the next slide [page 13], as we talk again about the scope of public health, it is very \\nbroad and flexible in scope and responsibility because it relates to the health of our public \\ngenerally.  As a rule, our efforts are driven to understand why people get sick and why they \\ndie.  Our overarching vision is for each person to live a long and healthy life.  If we can \\nunderstand the health issues in our population and subpopulations, we can try to intervene to \\nprevent that negative outcome.  We often find our focus is on infectious disease because it \\ncan spread quickly through the population. \\n \\nThis next slide [page 14] is a model we use often in public health, and we can really speak \\nabout the issue as it relates to this.  It is called a social-ecological model and it helps us \\nunderstand the many levels of an issue, especially as it relates to population or public health.  \\nThis model starts locally with the individual and then there are peers and family.  It evolves \\nto the highest level—the influence of policy.  This model helps us understand which level has \\nan impact on the health issues so we can develop specific interventions at each of those \\nlevels. \\n \\nThe next slide [page 15] shows an example concerning childhood obesity.  With childhood \\nobesity we look at the child.  That child\\'s personal demographics are a primary factor in the \\nweight, but we also look at the parents\\' weight and food preferences in the home.  The policy \\nlevel, in that same scenario, is where the larger population efforts occur around childhood \\nobesity, for example, seeing nutritional details on food items or on restaurant menus.  Also, \\nthe taxing of certain items can change behavior.  Those are all policy opportunities as we \\nlook at obesity and healthy living. \\n \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 8, 2021 \\nPage 4 \\n \\nI would like to speak about the amazing universities in our state, specifically, and nationwide \\nas well.  There is great diversity in the field of public health, and what you are seeing here is \\na list of the specialties or core competencies that our public health professionals can focus on \\n[page 16].  This is truly a holistic approach to addressing public health.  Again, I want to \\nacknowledge our universities in the state that have been such a pivotal part of our response to \\nCOVID-19. \\n \\nI am going to provide a highlight and a link on the next slide [page 17].  Public health, like \\nall topics, evolves over time.  We are in a period of time coined \"Public Health 3.0.\"  While \\npublic health professionals a century ago may have focused on very granular outbreaks or \\ncrises, now we function more as strategists to pull partners together to look at inequities and \\nopportunities for intervention.   \\n \\nIn public health, we often get asked about our relationship with health care.  It truly is a \\npartnership.  Health care focuses on the health of the individual patient.  We focus on how all \\nthe patients together become population health, the health status of the collective group, and \\nhow to intervene.   \\n \\nPublic health is in constant evolution.  With Public Health 3.0, we focus much more on \\ncollective impacts and reaching our residents where they are.  We also understand more and \\nfocus on social determinants of health that lead to a particular health outcome.  You will hear \\nthat  a  person\\'s  ZIP  Code  is  often  more  a  reflection  of  that  person\\'s  health  than  that \\nindividual\\'s genetic code.  That is one of the things we look at as we delve into public health \\ndata.    For  example,  you  may  have  health  insurance  due  to  the  Patient  Protection  and \\nAffordable Care Act, but you might not be getting preventative screening even though it is an \\nallowable service.  In public health, we try to understand why that is occurring.  What is the \\nbarrier if it is no longer health insurance, and how can we help address any health issues a \\nperson might have and intervene? \\n \\nI am going to transition from global public health comments to concepts about public health \\nin Nevada.  Nevada is one of only two states nationally that has a largely decentralized public \\nhealth structure.  The bulk of our population is served by a district health department, but the \\nstate still provides direct service in many counties.  We have also delegated some authority, \\nfor example, to Carson City Health and Human Services [page 20, Exhibit C]. \\n \\nGoing to the next slide [page 21], the structure and functions of public health are in several \\nstatutes, but I will highlight just two.  Those are found in Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) \\nChapter 439 and in NRS Chapter 441A.  These have been of particular interest during the \\nCOVID-19 response.  You will hear later from our two district health departments that \\nfunction largely as independent health agencies, as well as from Carson City Health and \\nHuman  Services,  which  operates  as  a  regional  health  department  under  delegation  of \\nauthority that is allowed in that law. \\n \\nThe next slide [page 22] shows the county boards of health.  In this case, I am focusing on \\nour rural and frontier counties related to population size in the statute.  Each county is \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 8, 2021 \\nPage 5 \\n \\nrequired to have a county board of health represented by the county commissioners, the \\nsheriff, and a health officer.  We work a great deal with the designated health officer.  One of \\nthe challenges we had, as it relates to COVID-19, is that every rural county looked different.  \\nIn some rural counties, there was a very functional board of health that was meeting on a \\nregular basis and tackling population health issues locally.  In some cases, there was no board \\nof health.  Trying to have that stood up and to identify a county health officer in the midst of \\nthe COVID-19 pandemic was problematic.  That said, the counties have moved mountains in \\nthis regard, and now that functional necessity of a public health system at the county level is \\nincredible.  I want to acknowledge all the efforts there.  They have really stepped up. \\n \\nThe next slide [page 23, Exhibit C] is a short list of what we have learned.  In public health \\nwe have a wide variety of partners we work with when we address a specific issue, but one of \\nthe challenges is that we had to become the convener in many cases, not the doer.  We had to \\nwork  with  our  counties  and  county  leadership,  but  specifically,  we  had  to  work  with \\nemergency management.  That includes people locally including our National Guard and the \\nDivision of Emergency Management within the Department of Public Safety at the statewide \\nlevel.  They have really helped with the logistics—to operationalize these incredible public \\nhealth interventions.  We also clearly identified a need for flexible funding to support a \\npublic health crisis in real time and support basic infrastructure.  As you know, our federal \\npartners did come through with funding for epidemiology, lab work capacity, immunization, \\npublic health preparedness, and other items, but we did function with what we had for several \\nmonths in the beginning.  With the exception of COVID-19 funding, we do not have the \\nability to address the need locally.  We have many public health crises, but we do not have \\nbasic infrastructure funding.  \\n \\nI also talked about decentralization of public health.  Again, I cannot speak highly enough \\nabout how our rural and frontier counties stepped up.  They had no infrastructure prior to the \\npandemic, but they accepted delegation of authority from our chief medical officer.  They \\nhave shown such great work.  I see great value in watering that effort and continuing to see it \\ngrow with other diseases outside of COVID-19.  That will take some infrastructure funding \\nso they can set up such structures. \\n \\nWe try to get as much money as possible out into the field for direct service because the \\nfunds are so limited.  As a result, as a division we skimp on our own funding for things such \\nas human resources support, information technology (IT) infrastructure support, and fiscal \\nsupport, because the need for direct service in our counties is so great; however, that creates a \\nhuge challenge for us.  We received $430 million for the response to COVID-19, but as a \\ndivision we need to get those subawards out and ensure that the spending is appropriate and \\ncorrect, and that is a big ask.  That has been a challenge for us.  I want to acknowledge our IT \\nstaff because another huge challenge is that we had a very antiquated system for infectious \\ndisease, yet our lab reporting rose 8,000 times above what we were used to, which really \\ncrippled our system.  In some cases, we were largely functioning on faxed reports, and that \\nquickly became unmanageable.  We have had to use some of the funding to develop things \\nwithin our public health infrastructure that will have an impact on all diseases going forward.   \\n \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 8, 2021 \\nPage 6 \\n \\nAnother major challenge we had was the expectation that we could release data in a day.  \\nRelated  to  public  health,  it  is  not  typically  real-time  surveillance,  so  we  were  really \\nchallenged.  With HIV data, for example, we take a year and a half to clean it before we \\nrelease it to make sure it is the most accurate record on file.  Those are things that were \\nreasonable expectations of our community and of people who needed that information, and it \\nhas been an incredible lift on behalf of the public health structure. \\n \\nThe last slide is related to public health funding [page 24].  Each biennium, we report where \\npublic health spending in Nevada is ranked nationally.  According to the America\\'s Health \\nRankings, we are the least healthy state as far as public health funding is concerned.  Alaska \\nis the best at $289 per capita, and Nevada is at $50 per capita.  That said, we have had \\ninvestments in the past several years related to family planning, women\\'s health connection, \\nand other services, but we are still much further behind than many other states.  One report \\nshows that an investment of $10 per person in evidence-based programs can save the country \\n$16 billion annually within five years. \\n \\nAn important point is who benefits most from public health, and it is children, infants, and \\nunderresourced communities.  A huge ask of us is to identify inequity and disparities and \\noffer suggestions as to how we can intervene and ensure they are removed.  That concludes \\nthe Division of Public and Behavioral Health\\'s presentation. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nSome of those numbers were quite impressive.  I like to make a point of highlighting when \\nour state is a leader nationally.  Specifically, you mentioned that our numbers were about half \\nin the long-term care facilities.  I believe you said we were at 20 percent and even lower \\nmore recently.  Can you highlight what we are doing right, and are we sharing these best \\nmanagement practices with other state agencies and other regulatory responders? \\n \\nLisa Sherych: \\nEarly on we created what are essentially strike teams.  We have always had an Office of \\nPublic Health Investigations and Epidemiology.  We also have our Health Protection and \\nPreparedness team and our Health Care Quality and Compliance team.  Early on we made a \\nconcerted effort to make sure those three teams were working very closely together along \\nwith the facilities to identify infection control issues and provide a lot of technical assistance.  \\nWe are coming from the angle of improving a situation rather than taking punitive actions.  \\nWe have also done work with the Department of Corrections.  Our staff has been out to a \\ncouple of those facilities and has provided information on how they can address certain \\ninfectious disease control issues.  I do not have any information concerning sharing with \\nother states, but I will check and provide that information later. \\n \\nJulia Peek: \\nMs. Sherych mentioned the health facility epidemiology team.  That is something unique to \\nNevada.  We learn from our crises in public health and we developed that team as a result of \\nthe hepatitis C outbreak in Clark County.  We knew we had to have a strike team that could \\nintervene immediately.  We had that relationship and structure built prior to COVID-19, so \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 8, 2021 \\nPage 7 \\n \\nwe were able to make minor modifications to that.  Other states that had not worked so \\ndirectly with epidemiology and health care-associated infections had to build that from \\nscratch.  That is something we are really proud of.   \\n \\nThe other thing we learned as a result of COVID-19 is that we were on separate reporting \\nsystems at the districts and the state.  Now we are all going to move to the same infectious \\ndisease reporting system so we have a standardized way to collect data.  We understand that \\ncounty lines are not solid, and we need to be able to see how people go across the state, \\nespecially with infectious diseases.  We are learning a lot and making foundational public \\nhealth improvements.  I will note that for COVID-19 vaccination, we have the highest \\nadministration rate in our region, so we are talking with our regional partners, telling them \\nwhat we are doing, and offering suggestions concerning what is working and what is not.  \\nWith this crisis, we are a leader in the region. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \\nAre you collecting demographic information on COVID-19 rates?  How is Nevada looking \\nas compared to national rates of COVID-19 infection and deaths in the black communities in \\nour state?  I hope we are collecting that data and that you can report that information. \\n \\nJulia Peek: \\nWe are collecting information on race and ethnicity.  We also are one of the only states that \\nadded questions related to LGBTQI issues.  We will not know of disparities until we look at \\nthe data and see if there is truly a disparity in any areas.  I think we are pretty standard, and \\nI am happy to pull that data for you directly.  I would like to explain some of the challenges \\nwith public health data in this capacity.  We get that data from lab reports, so the cases you \\nsee on the Nevada Health Response dashboard are because we needed it in real time so we \\ncould see what was happening with the disease; however, lab reports required by our federal \\npartners now often do not have race or ethnicity, so we were going off a lot of data that was \\nunknown and trying to investigate those cases so we could get that information added.  It is a \\nhuge effort.  I hope our laboratory partners continue to improve in those areas because we \\nneed to know what the inequities look like in our community. \\n \\nWe are also collecting that information related to vaccinations.  The Governor has reported \\nthat he is going to focus on equity as we move forward.  A challenge we experience with \\nequity  is  that  it  is  self-reported.    Sometimes  people  are  uncomfortable  sharing  that \\ninformation, so we have to communicate effectively about why we collect that data and how \\nwe are going to use that data.  We are doing a lot of effort in that regard right now, but across \\nthe board, Nevada is trying to be as progressive as possible in asking as many questions \\nacross all the pieces in the hope that we can find inequities of race, ethnicity, and otherwise, \\nand then address them. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nIf you can provide any of that data to our committee secretary, we will distribute it to the rest \\nof the Committee. \\n \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 8, 2021 \\nPage 8 \\n \\nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \\nCan you tell me, as a representative for my community, what can those of us who are elected \\nofficials do to help improve the confidence among our community members to report this \\ndata to you so you can have better data to report and collect?  What can we do to help? \\n \\nJulia Peek: \\nYou truly are the champions in the community.  What you say will be heard.  For our part in \\npublic health, we will make an effort to get you the talking points and information you need \\nto then go champion that back to your community.  I will send information to you all, \\nspecifically around vaccinations, but also concerning the importance, in any disease and \\ninvestigation, of providing that information to the public health partners and understanding \\nthat it is confidential.  It is used by us to bring resources to the community and identify if \\nthere  are  disparities.    I  am  happy  to  get  you  some  talking  points  to  share  with  your \\ncommunity. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Titus: \\nThank you to all of you who are presenting today, for what you are doing for the public \\nhealth of Nevada.  I know these are challenging times, and it would have been challenging \\nwithout a pandemic.   \\n \\nRecently in the news there has been information about disparity concerning the vaccines and \\nwho has been receiving them.  In the money committee, I have discussed receiving COVID-\\n19 funds, where they are going, and making sure we have that outreach and trust.  Our \\nAttorney  General  made  a  big  point  when  he  got  his  vaccine  because  he  wanted  the \\ncommunities to be reassured that it is okay to get the vaccine.  As we know, there is a huge \\namount of distrust in the process and, frankly, rightfully so. \\n \\nMy concern is that there is significant disparity about who has gotten this vaccine.  Is it \\nbecause you were following what the Office of the Governor set up concerning different \\nlanes and tiers?  In the first tier were first responders, then people over the age of 70 were in \\nthe second tier, and there were those kinds of criteria.  How was it decided to give those \\nvaccinations?  You were just following the tiers as directed, but has that changed at all, now \\nwe know that may not have been good enough? \\n \\nJulia Peek: \\nRegarding funding, the disparities and inequities have been something our federal partners \\nhave been emphasizing since the start of the pandemic, and those are reflected in the data we \\nhave as well.  Related to the vaccination grant, at least 10 percent of that award has to go \\ndirectly to addressing disparity in the community and equitable distribution.  That includes \\nracial and ethnic disparity, but also rural residents were specifically called out.  Those are \\nthings each of our local health departments will build into their budgets as they spend that \\naward.  There is also an equity task force that is a requirement of that award.  In Nevada, we \\nare one of the states that developed staffing within the Department of Health and Human \\nServices\\'  Office  of  Minority  Health  and  Equity  from  the  beginning  of  the  COVID-19 \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 8, 2021 \\nPage 9 \\n \\nresponse, which has been working with us on testing, how we message that appropriately, \\nand now on vaccination as well, as has our coalition.  We will continue to work in that area. \\n \\nRelated to the playbook, that is such an important discussion and point.  If we looked at \\nstraight population distribution, then we would look at the folks within a certain ZIP Code \\ngetting the level that is appropriate, based on their overall piece of the population.  As you \\nmentioned, that is not how this works; it is related to lanes or tiers.  It has been called \\ndifferent things, but we based our playbook and our recommendations on the Advisory \\nCommittee on Immunization Practices recommendations and what our CDC partners said.  It \\nmight look like there is inequity in certain ZIP Codes or age groups, but it is a result of \\nfollowing the playbook. \\n \\nAnything we present can be improved on, so it is a matter of drawing more attention to it and \\nensuring that we have data collected.  This goes back to how important it is to share accurate \\ninformation with the person vaccinating you on address, race, ethnicity, et cetera, so when we \\npull the data, especially when it becomes more general population-based, that we can ensure \\nthere is a level of equity.  The other thing we are doing is looking at how  we reach \\npopulations that might have a hard time getting vaccinated, so we will be looking at mobile \\noutreach.  You have seen it before with the Mammovan—where we can go to a community \\nand vaccinate or test that community with that mobile resource.  It will be particularly helpful \\nto target specific ZIP Codes when we eventually get a one-dose vaccine for COVID-19 like \\nthe Johnson & Johnson.  Again, that is most important when it becomes a general-population \\nvaccination. \\n \\nWe are working again with equity across the 70-plus-year-olds.  The biggest challenge is the \\nsupply issue at this point.  We have a limited number of vaccinations, so it is challenging for \\nfolks to get the resource.  Something we have done to implement equity and address barriers \\npresented is develop the call line.  Though not perfect, it is getting a huge number of calls.  \\nWe are walking people through how to sign up, so if you do not have a smart device or you \\nare  having  a  hard  time  navigating  the  website  or  the  various  pharmacy  websites  for \\nenrollment, you can call our helpline and we will walk you through.  We are not perfect by \\nany means, but we are certainly trying to get better eyes on it and better data so we ensure \\nequity at every level we have control over.   \\n \\nAssemblywoman Titus: \\nTo follow up on that, could you get us some numbers?  Not just on the COVID-19 vaccine, \\nbecause as you said, this is a unique situation and we developed the best plan we could.  As \\nyou said, it may not be perfect, but there have been some real disparities in getting vaccines \\nin general.  We will get control of this pandemic, but we may not necessarily get control of \\nthe need to reach out and get more people vaccinated, and not just with the COVID-19 \\nvaccine, but with the flu vaccine.  We are at the bottom as related to numbers of folks who \\nactually get vaccinated for the flu.  I think only 44 percent of our population gets the flu \\nvaccine, so this goes far beyond COVID-19.  What COVID-19 has done is show us the holes \\nin our system and bring them to the forefront.  If we could see some data on what the \\ntraditional vaccination rates are across the board for all vaccines available and how we need \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 8, 2021 \\nPage 10 \\n \\nto do better for all members of our Nevada communities, that would be helpful.  We are still \\nlacking on some of these vaccines that need to be given or that people should consider \\ngetting.  Hopefully, when we get some of this data you say you are now gathering, we will \\nget information about the disparity rates in overall vaccines and who is getting them. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nIf Committee members have further questions, I would ask you to reach out directly to our \\npresenters, and we can get you their contact information.  The next presentation is from \\nCarson City Health and Human Services. \\n \\nNicki Aaker, Director, Carson City Health and Human Services: \\nWe have a county board of health.  Carson City\\'s municipal code, as relates to our board of \\nhealth, requires a Nevada-licensed doctor, whereas NRS Chapter 439 does not.  Carson City \\nelected to create its county board of health in 2003.  The board of health\\'s composition \\nincludes a county health officer, the Carson City board of supervisors, and the sheriff. \\n[page 28, Exhibit C]. \\n \\nWe  are  a  local  health  authority,  not  a  district,  since  Carson  City  is  a  consolidated \\nmunicipality.  To be a district, two or more counties or cities need to join together.  It is a city \\ndepartment within Carson City.  Our department received public health accreditation in May \\n2016 after many years spent working on that endeavor.  The core documents of accreditation \\nare the community health needs assessment, the community health improvement plan, and \\nthe  strategic  plan.    Some  other  important  plans  include  the  quality  improvement  plan, \\nworkforce development plan, risk communications plan, and the public health emergency \\noperations plan.  Right now, we are in the midst of going through reaccreditation. \\n \\nStaffing at the health department before COVID-19 was 38 full-time equivalents (FTEs).  \\nCurrently we have 65.5 FTEs.  This slide shows our organizational chart [page 30].  The \\ndisease control and prevention division and public health preparedness organizational charts \\nwill be on other slides.  The budget for Carson City is $9.4 million [page 31]:  29 percent is \\ngeneral-funded; and 63 percent is grant-funded, which is currently higher due to the COVID-\\n19 grants we received.  There is also 8 percent from revenue received.  The revenue includes \\nan interlocal agreement. \\n \\nOne of our divisions is chronic disease prevention and health promotion.  The adolescent \\nhealth program conducts abstinence and comprehensive sexual health classes for youth and \\nfamilies-talking-together classes that teach parents how they can talk to their children about \\nsex.  Staff have been researching creative ways to conduct classes since schools are not \\nallowing outsiders in due to COVID-19, although some of the alternative schools for troubled \\nyouth have allowed our instructors to teach in person.   \\n \\nWe also have a Ryan White Retention in Care Program that attempts to find individuals who \\nare out of care and have been diagnosed with HIV, determines what their barriers are, and \\nhelps get them back into care.  This is mainly focused on the rural and frontier counties.  We \\nhave our Tobacco Control and Prevention Program that focuses on providing educational \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 8, 2021 \\nPage 11 \\n \\npresentations to the youth, discouraging initiation of the use of tobacco products and vaping.  \\nWe collaborate with the Nevada Tobacco Prevention Coalition and other agencies to educate \\ndecision makers and the public on the benefit of policy solutions to address e-cigarette use \\namong youth and young adults.  We continue promoting counter-marketing campaigns about \\nthe danger of the use of tobacco products and e-cigarettes.  We facilitate referrals from \\nproviders that serve the youth to the My Life, My Quit program.  This program is researching \\ndifferent ways to reach its audience due to the COVID-19 restrictions.  We also have a small \\ngrant for diabetes outreach.  The staffing for the chronic disease prevention and health \\npromotion division is 4.5 FTEs and this division is 100 percent grant-funded. \\n \\nWe also have clinical services, and the services we provide are listed [page 33, Exhibit C].  \\nWe receive Title X funding directly from the federal government and we subgrant some of \\nthat funding to Douglas County.  We receive other funding from the state either as pass-\\nthrough grants or from state funding.  Currently the clinic is seeing patients and we are taking \\nmeasures to protect the staff and the clients from COVID-19.  The staffing in that division \\nis 10 FTEs and that division is 9 percent general-funded, 61 percent grant funded, and 30 \\npercent revenue.  We bill different insurances and we also collect cash payments on a sliding \\nscale for services provided to those who are uninsured or who do not wish to use their \\ninsurance. \\n \\nAnother division is disease control and prevention which consists of environmental health \\nand epidemiology.  Speaking about the environmental-health side of the division, I have \\nlisted the establishments that our health inspectors inspect and permit [pages 35 and 36].  We \\nprovide environmental health services to Douglas County through an interlocal agreement.  \\nOther duties are also listed here; please note that a couple of the duties are only in Carson \\nCity.  Staffing within that program is 6.5 FTEs, and that program is 34 percent general-\\nfunded,  2  percent  grant-funded,  55  percent  interlocal-funded,  and  revenue  makes  up \\n9 percent.   \\n \\nThe other side of this division is epidemiology.  Having both environmental health and \\nepidemiology under one division created some really big challenges when the pandemic \\nstarted, and we will be looking at something changing in the future. \\n \\nOur epidemiology program is very involved in COVID-19 contact tracing and reporting \\n[page 37].  Along with COVID-19, there continue to be other reportable diseases that need to \\nbe investigated.  Currently we have 1.5 FTEs working on those other diseases.  Staffing for \\nthis entire program currently is 16.5 FTEs.  Prior to COVID-19 it was 2 FTEs.  We also have \\nsome individuals helping us who are not included in our staffing.  We have two from the \\nNational  Guard,  we  have  two  behavioral  health  ambassadors,  and  we  have  two  CDC \\nFoundation  employees  until  March  31.    We  will  be  adding  the  two  CDC  Foundation \\nemployees to our staffing.  This epidemiology program is 2 percent general funded and \\n98 percent grant funded.    \\n \\nI have added our organizational chart [page 38].  Carson City Health and Human Services is \\ndifferent from other Nevada health authorities by having human services within the health \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 8, 2021 \\nPage 12 \\n \\ndepartment [page 39].  This division provides health, welfare, and community assistance as \\nrequired by NRS along with some of the other activities previously listed.  I would like to \\ntalk about the Forensics Assessment Services Triage Team.  This is a collaboration with \\nother service agencies that go into the county jail and attempt to connect inmates with \\nservices so they will have that upon release.  This division has 8 FTEs and is 45 percent \\ngeneral-funded and 55 percent grant-funded.  \\n \\nAs this is a public health emergency, our public health preparedness division is leading a \\nCOVID-19 response [page 40, Exhibit C].  Testing and vaccination efforts are being led by \\nthis division, along with working with other city, county, and governmental entities.  We do \\nhave delegation of authority from the state and counties to provide COVID-19 service to \\nDouglas, Lyon, and Storey Counties in addition to Carson City.  Our staffing prior to \\nCOVID-19 was 5 FTEs, and we are now up to 20 FTEs for the COVID-19 response.  We \\nhave one volunteer registered nurse doing testing, and we have 10 to 14 National Guard \\nmembers for two to four days per week.  This division is 100 percent grant-funded, and \\nI included the organizational chart for this division [page 41]. \\n \\nI included the COVID-19 timeline showing our response [page 42].  We have been at this for \\na year since we started with planning for the repatriation of our 15 residents from the Grand \\nPrincess cruise ship.  As part of our COVID-19 response, we have conducted 92 testing \\nevents since May, along with testing at the health department Monday through Friday.  We \\nhave conducted 35 vaccination events since the end of December.  The quad counties\\' \\ncumulative positive cases are 10,910, and we have had 7,934 recoveries.  As of February 6, \\n2021, we have received 11,975 vaccinations, and we have given 11,258 vaccinations.  We do \\nhave 700 second-dose vaccinations that we will be administering this week.  Our partners \\ninclude our city and county governments, the state of Nevada, the Division of Public and \\nBehavioral  Health,  the  state  of  Nevada\\'s  immunization  program,  the  state\\'s  Division  of \\nEmergency Management, Immunize Nevada, the National Guard, area hospitals, and our area \\ndoctors.  As you saw earlier, we have utilized a lot of those partners in Ms. Peek\\'s chart in \\nthis endeavor.  \\n \\nI have included pictures on the following slide [page 44].  We did a vaccination clinic at the \\nCarson Valley Inn.  It was snowing that day, which led to our decision not to conduct any \\nmore  outdoor  events.    The  lower  picture  in  the  middle  is  our  trailer  which  contains \\neverything we need, so we are taking the show on the road.   \\n \\nWe see our challenges as opportunities for improvement.  As was talked about, we have a \\nchallenge with public health funding, and we have seen some big challenges with ZIP Codes \\nthat cross county lines.  Our public and the diseases do not recognize county lines.  Our \\nhealth department is very lean, which was mentioned during our accreditation site visit.  As a \\nresult, it was very difficult at the beginning of the pandemic to get the work done.  We were \\nworking long hours to get it done, so we opened up a quad county emergency operations \\ncenter.  Many of us wear different hats, so keeping up with all our other duties has been \\nchallenging.  We are limited on space.  Currently, we are finding sites for testing and \\nvaccination.  We are planning a mass vaccination when we get a higher allocation, but \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 8, 2021 \\nPage 13 \\n \\nsometimes finding sites for testing and vaccination can be difficult since we are in four \\ndifferent counties. \\n \\nOur IT infrastructure has been pushed to its limits.  Our current scheduling system is a \\nchallenge right now, but I am hoping for that to improve.  Working with four counties and \\nfour  separate  governmental  boards  and  four  different  health  officers  creates  challenges \\nsometimes because not everyone thinks the same way.  In 2003 when Carson City\\'s board of \\nsupervisors voted to have a board of health, regionalization was being discussed.  The quad \\ncounties concept has been successful for the public health preparedness program, so in the \\nfuture an opportunity will be to continue to explore the value of having a quad counties \\nhealth department to serve the region with a single board of health. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nDoes anyone have any questions?  [There was no response.]  The next person on our list is \\nMr. Kevin Dick. \\n \\nKevin Dick, District Health Officer, Washoe County Health District: \\nThe Washoe County Health District was established under NRS Chapter 439 under the \\nprovision for counties with populations of less than 700,000 [page 48, Exhibit C].  That \\nprovides for cities and the county to come together to establish a health district.  That was \\nformally done in 1972 through an interlocal agreement among Reno, Sparks, and Washoe \\nCounty.  We have a seven-member district board of health with two members appointed by \\neach jurisdiction, one of which is elected, and those six members appoint a physician as the \\nseventh member.  Per NRS Chapter 439, we have jurisdiction over all public health matters \\nin Washoe County.  \\n \\nThe  mission  of  public  health  is  to  protect  and  improve  the  health  of  the  community \\n[page 49].  It is a population- and community-level approach which makes it quite distinct \\nfrom health care which provides medical care to individuals.  As part of this activity, we \\nassess the health status of our community, and in that work we identify the factors that drive \\nmortality and morbidity in our community.  We find inequities in some populations that are \\nshaped by demographics, and social and economic disparities are driving a lot of the poor \\nhealth outcomes we see. \\n \\nI like to compare public health to an intelligence agency.  For the most part, we operate 24/7 \\nquietly in the background, we identify public health threats, and then we develop strategies to \\neliminate or control them.  If we are successful with that, no one really notices us and what \\nwe do.  It is pretty difficult, however, to hide a pandemic, so we have been very visible in the \\nnews this past year with COVID-19.  Usually the community is not so aware of our activities. \\n \\nWe are conducting surveillance.  We get reports of reportable diseases identified by the labs \\nunder NRS Chapter 441A.  We also have some real-time surveillance we used to look at \\nambulance  response  and  the  types  of  cases  they  are  responding  to,  information  from \\nemergency departments, and reports concerning admissions into hospitals.  We have an \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 8, 2021 \\nPage 14 \\n \\nintelligence platform that provides us with information about medications sold over the \\ncounter at the pharmacies and drug stores in our communities. \\n \\nWe also use disease prevention to control and prevent disease.  Part of that is the disease \\ninvestigation work we do on reportable diseases.  Immunization programs are a component \\nof that.  We have established regulations for a number of types of establishments and \\noperations that pose public health threats in our community.  We also mitigate against the \\nspread of disease.  People have become quite familiar with mitigation from the COVID-19 \\nresponse,  the  masking  and  social  distancing  and  the  reductions  in  capacities  for  some \\nbusinesses.  Other mitigations are isolation and quarantining of individuals who have been \\nexposed to diseases.  We also perform mosquito abatement and issue boil water orders when \\na water system has been disrupted. \\n \\nCommunications are also very important for public health.  They can alert our community to \\npublic health threats so the community can respond appropriately, as well as educating the \\ncommunity on healthy practices and behaviors. \\n \\nThis next slide provides an organizational chart for the health district and the allocations of \\nFTEs across our different programs [page 50, Exhibit C].  We are organized with four \\ndivisions providing public health services to our community as well as the administrative \\nhealth services office and the office of the district health officer.  The slide also provides \\ninformation on the membership of the district board of health.  We have about 166 FTEs \\nnormally  operating  at  the  health  district.    That  has  been  expanded  significantly  by  the \\nCOVID-19 response. \\n \\nI  am  going  to  run  through  the  different  divisions  that  provide  services  [page  51].    In \\ncommunity and clinical health, the community health component is really the chronic disease \\nprevention program.  In Washoe County, we focus on tobacco and substance misuse as well \\nas overweight and obesity as some of the driving factors for the chronic disease burden we \\nsee.  Our clinical services are all designed with a public health intention of improving \\ncommunity health and reducing the transmission of disease in the community.  We are not a \\nmedical care clinic; we have two Federally Qualified Health Centers, Northern Nevada \\nHOPES and Community Health Alliance, that provide excellent medical/clinical services for \\nour community.  Our services are oriented around family planning.  We provide reproductive \\nhealth services and immunizations that focus mostly on childhood immunizations.  We have \\na  small  maternal,  child,  and  adolescent  health  program  and  a  WIC  program  [Special \\nSupplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children] that provides nutritional \\nsupport for infants and mothers as well as education and counseling regarding nutrition and \\nbreastfeeding. \\n \\nOur sexual health program works to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases \\nas well as provides testing to identify and treat those diseases.  Our HIV program is involved \\nin  testing  for  HIV  and  connecting  people  who  are  found  to  be  HIV  positive  with  the \\nappropriate medical care.  Our tuberculosis (TB) program also does testing and provides \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 8, 2021 \\nPage 15 \\n \\ntreatment for TB as well as disease investigation of those who might have been exposed to \\npeople infected with TB in our community. \\n \\nOur epidemiology and public health preparedness division houses our epidemiology program \\nwhich is responsible for the surveillance and disease investigation functions.  Our public \\nhealth  preparedness  program  develops  plans  for  pandemic  response,  bioterrorism,  and \\nradiological attacks, and exercises those plans with community partners.  Also, everyone at \\nthe Washoe County Health District is trained under the federal incident command system so \\nwe are ready to stand up and function either independently or as partners in an emergency \\nresponse. \\n \\nWe have vital statistics, so we are responsible for recording births and deaths in Washoe \\nCounty as well as issuing birth and death certificates.  Also, Washoe County is unique in that \\nthe health district has oversight of our regional ambulance franchise for services through \\nRegional Emergency Medical Services Authority (REMSA).  In addition, we also have an \\nemergency medical service (EMS) program that is focused on oversight and coordination \\namong the EMS partners, our fire agencies, dispatch, and REMSA to keep the EMS system \\nfunctioning efficiently. \\n \\nThis is an organizational chart of the different programs we have in environmental health \\nservices [page 53, Exhibit C].  These are organized to prevent public health threats posed by \\ndifferent  establishments  and  different  operations  in  Washoe  County.    You  can  see  the \\ndifferent types of establishments we regulate.  I would like to help out with a few of the \\nacronyms on this page.  Under food safety are the \"HACCP/Operational Plans\" which are the \\nhazard analysis critical control points.  These are plans around critical points within a food \\nservice establishment for addressing risks.  We are trying to take a very risk-based approach \\nwith our regulatory oversight for these different entities.  Under special events you will see \\n\"EPI/FBD Complaints.\"  We respond to epidemiology and food-borne disease complaints in \\nthat program area.  Under our commercial plans and permitted facilities you will see \"IBD.\"  \\nWe regulate invasive body decorations which are body piercing and tattoo parlors.  We also \\nregulate what are listed as \"RV/MHP;\" those are recreational vehicle and mobile home parks.  \\nUnder our waste management functions, you will see \"UST,\" which are underground storage \\ntanks; we provide permitting for the construction of those. \\n \\nWe are unique in Nevada in that we provide air quality management programs [page 54].  \\nUnder state statute, the health district is designated to implement the federal Clean Air Act in \\nWashoe County.  We have a network of monitoring stations and we put out daily air quality \\ninformation and alerts as necessary.  We have a planning area where we work to try to \\nprevent deterioration of our air quality in Washoe County, so we have a woodstove program \\nthat addresses use of certified clean-burning stoves and the issuing of burn codes when we \\nhave inversions.  We also have a smog check program and programs to address ozone \\nprecursors coming from vehicles.  Our permitting program addresses stationary air pollution \\nsources, surface disturbances for dust control, and demolition and remodeling activities in \\nregard to asbestos abatement.  We do inspections and enforcement if we find problems with \\nthose permitted facilities. \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 8, 2021 \\nPage 16 \\n \\nThe office of the district health officer falls under me directly, and we work to support the \\nboard of health and its monthly board meetings [page 55].  We also are an accredited health \\ndistrict.    We  received  our  national  accreditation  in  2019,  and  we  work  with  the  other \\ndivisions  across  the  health  district  to  maintain  that  accreditation  status.    We  do  health \\nassessments, and through those we work with our partners to identify how to work together \\nas a community to improve the priority areas we identified in the assessments.  Currently we \\nare focusing on areas of housing and homelessness, behavioral health, and physical activity \\nand nutrition with a number of community partners, with a plan for moving forward which \\nwe have been implementing over the past few years. \\n \\nWe  lead  our  quality  improvement  and  workforce  development  efforts  as  well  as  our \\ncommunications.  I want to also acknowledge our government affairs liaison, Joelle Dodson.  \\nYou may see her presenting testimony, public comment, or communicating with you during \\nthe session.  \\n \\nThis is our $24 million budget for 2021 without the additional funding we have received for \\nCOVID-19 [page 56, Exhibit C].  Our largest funding comes from the general fund transfer \\nfrom Washoe County and is about 40 percent of our budget.  Under statute, we are also able \\nto charge fees for services such as permitting and other regulatory oversight activities.  We \\ncollect revenue from the sale of tires in Nevada that supports some of our solid waste \\nmanagement efforts.  Our air quality program is supported through a $1 fee on the smog \\ncertificates issued in Washoe County.   \\n \\nThe federal and state grants that compose just over 25 percent of our budget are mostly \\nfederal funding that is either direct or passed through the state.  As was mentioned, Nevada \\nhas a very low state investment in public health, and so we receive 1.8 percent of our budget \\nfrom state funding through grants.  We have received an additional $16.8 million in federal \\nfunds for the COVID-19 response in addition to our $24 million budget, so you can see that \\nis a significant additional source of funding.   \\n \\nHere  is  a  quick  overview  of  our  COVID-19  response  [page  57].    We  activated  our \\ndepartment\\'s incident command system on January 17, 2020.  Our first case occurred on \\nMarch 5, and then we moved to a regional response.  We have been at it ever since.  These \\npictures are of our response.  We have learned and improvised as we learned more about the \\ndisease.  You will see here some historic photos that span our premask days and our mask \\ndays and response. \\n \\nSince the pandemic started, we stood up a drive-through COVID-19 testing operation that we \\nhad operational within one-and-a-half days of having our first case identified in Washoe \\nCounty on March 5.  We have learned from and improved that operation since that day and \\nhave expanded it dramatically.  We are now using that same facility for our COVID-19 \\nvaccination point of dispensing (POD).  We set a new record last Friday with 1,800 people \\nvaccinated.  We stood up a COVID-19 call center, and we now have 24 people dedicated to \\nstaffing that.  The call center does the scheduling for testing as well as for administering the \\nvaccines.  It provides for reporting of test results and does an incredible amount of data entry \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 8, 2021 \\nPage 17 \\n \\nwork on the backside of providing those vaccines, to get that information into the data \\nmanagement systems the federal government has set up. \\n \\nWe have increased the number of disease investigators from 3 to over 50—to contact the \\npositive cases and have them isolate and to identify close contacts for quarantine.  We have \\nover 85 people working in our field operation for testing and vaccinations. \\n \\nMuch like Ms. Aaker was talking about in Carson City, space has been a requirement as we \\nhave expanded staffing.  When I send an email to all health district staff, it now goes to a list \\nof 366 people.  We have taken over buildings C and D of the county complex in addition to \\nbuilding  B that  we  normally  occupy.    We  have  benefitted  from  many  people who  are \\nremotely working because we have been able to take up some of the space they used to \\noccupy.   Scott Oxarart, our communications manager, has done a phenomenal job.  We put \\nout over 330 press releases over the last year, and I held over 60 media briefings over the \\ncourse of the year.  Mr. Oxarart has led our regional information center which created two \\nwebsites, one on the COVID-19 response and the other specifically on the vaccine, now that \\nit is available, and how we are managing that.  There are also several social media platforms \\nand accounts that have been established.  We could not have done all this without the \\npartners we have.  The National Guard is integrated into our operation.  We have the \\ncommunity emergency response team and medical reserve corps volunteers all helping with \\nour operations. \\n \\nCOVID-19 has laid bare the social inequities in our community for health outcomes.  Many \\npeople are living on the edge.  They have to work to provide food for their families and a \\nroof over their heads.  These are essential workers.  Many work jobs that earn below \\nminimum wage.  They are not able to work remotely; they do not have paid sick leave; and \\nthey often live in close quarters with other family members.  As a result, we have seen a \\ndisproportionate impact within our Hispanic community throughout this pandemic.  We also \\nneed to understand that the data on testing show that the Hispanic population is being tested \\nin disproportionately low numbers relative to their population in Nevada, so these numbers \\nmay not be reliable [page 59, Exhibit C].  We have also seen a devastating impact on our \\nelderly population with the number of deaths occurring in that segment of our population. \\n \\nFortunately, we are trending better with the number of cases we are experiencing in our \\ncommunity.  While this figure is from last week, as of yesterday, our seven-day moving \\naverage for new cases in Washoe County is down to 90 and our positivity rate has declined to \\n11.1 percent [page 60].  Not so long ago, the positivity rate was 22 percent, so we are grateful \\nto see this.  We are not out of the woods yet; we want to continue to see these numbers \\ndecrease, but we think we are seeing good outcomes with everyone working together, the \\nmitigation measures, and the pause the Governor instituted.  Sadly, 616 deaths have been \\nreported in Washoe County to date.  When we were surging here in Washoe County, it was \\nvery frightening.  Our health system was under great stress, and we were seriously looking at \\nthe possibility that we would need to ration medical care, so I am very relieved to see these \\nnumbers going down as they are. \\n \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 8, 2021 \\nPage 18 \\n \\nThis is a picture on December 15 of our first shipment of Pfizer vaccine arriving at the health \\ndistrict [page 61].  Fortunately, we were able to obtain an ultracold freezer, so we were able \\nto receive and store the Pfizer vaccine as well as the Moderna vaccine here at the health \\ndistrict.  We also have a number of PODs providing the vaccine in the community as shown \\nhere [page 62].  We have a retail pharmacy vaccine program in which we have pharmacies \\nthat are vaccinating staff and residents of long-term care facilities.  We also have community \\npartners and POD strike teams doing vaccinations; our fire agencies have been engaged in \\nproviding PODs, and the Community Health Alliance also is providing vaccines in a POD at \\nits parking lot. \\n \\nThe rest of my presentation consists of a few pictures [pages 62-66, Exhibit C].   There is an \\naerial view of six lanes at the Reno-Sparks Livestock Events Center, of the vehicles stacked \\nup in those lanes, and the testing stations we use.  We also have a view of stations with \\nmodular  roofing  we  put  together  and  of  the  inside  where  the  vaccine  is  dispensed  by \\npharmacists and we collect the paperwork.  The next slide shows our vaccine distribution \\nstatistics [page 67].  As of today, we have administered over 29,000 vaccine doses through \\nthe  health  district.    The  next  slide  provides  you  with  the  website  for  our  vaccination \\ninformation  which  people  could  use  to  find  out  how  soon  they  might  get  vaccinated \\n[page 68].  We are maintaining a waiting list for seniors, and we also have a phone number \\navailable which is 775-328-2427. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nAre there questions? \\n \\nAssemblywoman Peters: \\nThank you for your presentation and all your hard work.  I know Washoe County has had a \\nparticularly difficult time because our homeless population has been increasing and now the \\nwinter months have hit.  I would like to hear a little about treating and testing our homeless \\npopulation, managing care for them, housing them in facilities that are accommodating their \\nneeds, and how you are balancing that. \\n \\nKevin Dick: \\nWe are working closely with the human services agency and our other regional partners \\nregarding the homeless population.  Some of the first pictures you saw relating to COVID-19 \\nwere photos of testing we were doing at the Reno Events Center.  We utilized that facility so \\nwe could provide additional distancing for the shelter population because there was limited \\nspace at the Record Street community assistance center.  The county also has been able to \\nstand up new facilities for women and families at the Northern Nevada Adult Mental Health \\nServices campus so that is providing additional capacity there.  A men\\'s shelter has been \\nestablished on Fourth Street to increase the population that can be housed there.  A positive \\nresult of this has been the work done together across the region on plans for a larger area for \\nthe homeless—a campus and complex, an area called the Governor\\'s Bowl.  For people who \\nare homeless and who have tested positive for COVID-19, we have a contract regionally with \\nWellCare.  They are able to accept those people who do not require hospital-level care and \\nprovide them with support services and housing during their isolation period. \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 8, 2021 \\nPage 19 \\n \\nAssemblywoman Peters: \\nIf you have data on the virus contraction rates in our homeless population, as well as the \\ndemographics, it would be really good to see that information.  Can you follow up with staff \\non that? \\n \\nKevin Dick: \\nI can follow up on that. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nAre there any other questions?  [There was no response.]  I will now move to our last \\npresentation of the day, the Southern Nevada Health District. \\n \\nFermin Leguen, District Health Officer, Southern Nevada Health District: \\nIn southern Nevada, we have our board of health and there are 11 members of the board with \\nrepresentation from different cities and the county [page 70, Exhibit C].  We now have more \\nthan 680 employees, which is significant growth from our previous numbers.  About two \\nyears ago, there were fewer than 500 employees here.   \\n \\nThere are five divisions in our health district, among them community health, environmental \\nhealth, critical services, administration, and a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC), \\nwhich is a new development within the health district.  We received an award from the \\nHealth  Resources  and  Services  Administration  (HRSA)  within  the  U.S.  Department  of \\nHealth  and  Human  Services  in  September  2019,  and  we  were  able  to  start  the  FQHC \\noperations.  Recently we received a second award from HRSA that allowed our operation for \\nthe next three years.  Right now, we are still developing our health center, but it is fully \\nfunctional. \\n \\nWe have a similar administration as the ones presented by our colleagues, so I will not \\npresent an organizational chart or how the divisions operate.  Those are very common among \\nthe health districts.  I just want to emphasize some of the areas where we have a different \\napproach.  For example, two years ago we started offering a preventive medicine program.  \\nThat  is  something  that  was  created  because  there  is  a  need  for  preventive  medicine \\nphysicians in Nevada, and we saw the opportunity to really contribute to that effort.  That is a \\npartnership between us and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV).  The residents \\nspend the first year doing their master of public health programs at the university and then, \\nthe second year, they do their clinical and management rotations here with us at the health \\ndistrict.  We also have been working on other projects regarding opioid reduction.  We \\nreceived a grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for overdose \\ndata  collection  with  the  engagement  of  surveillance  and  preventive  action  for  a  drug \\noverdose.   \\n \\nThis was our budget at the beginning of the fiscal year beginning on July 1 [page 72].  It was \\n$98 million.  Our current budget is $139 million.  Because of COVID-19, we received almost \\n$32-$33  million  from  the  CDC  to  support  our  enhanced  surveillance  activities,  contact \\ntracing, and testing.  The federal grant represents about 22 percent of our budget, so it is a \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 8, 2021 \\nPage 20 \\n \\nlittle bit different from what the slide shows because there was almost a 30 percent increase \\nin our budget because of COVID-19 activities.  We do have concerns about our budget for \\nthis coming fiscal year because our budget normally receives between 25 and 28 percent \\nfrom local property taxes, and our expectation is that those taxes might decrease next year.  \\nThat would have a negative impact in our activities, so this is something we have been \\ntalking with the county about, and we also are trying to prepare for that for next year. \\n \\nThis is a picture of our dashboard and it is available online [page 73].  This is the site where \\nwe share information with our community and anyone in the country who has an interest in \\nour data.  We have here the current number of cases that have been reported in Clark County, \\nhospitalizations, and also the number of deaths.  In the main menu of the dashboard there are \\nseven areas where people can click and get additional information.  We have data by ZIP \\nCode and mapping.  Also, under the \"Characteristics\" tab, people can look at trends.  The last \\nthing we incorporated into our dashboard was the place of possible exposure.  There we share \\nwith the community the areas that our cases report as being visited within the previous \\n14 days.  That is something we utilize with our environmental health division.  We have that \\ninformation in conjunction with additional data we receive from our patients.  Then, of \\ncourse, there is the trend of the pandemic in Clark County from last year until now.  For the \\nlast few weeks, we have seen a very big decrease in the number of cases.  We hope it \\ncontinues that way. \\n \\nThis is the incidence of COVID-19 in Clark County by race/ethnicity [page 74, Exhibit C].  \\nSince the beginning of this pandemic, in Clark County we have seen that the Hispanic \\npopulation has been the one with the largest impact in terms of cases.  This has been very \\nconsistent throughout the pandemic.  With the Hispanic population in Clark County, this high \\nincidence they are experiencing actually does not appear to translate to mortality.  The \\nreported mortality for Hispanics in Clark County is the lowest among the different racial and \\nethnic groups. \\n \\nThis is our ZIP Code map, and this is something we use in addition to the community one for \\nthe whole pandemic [page 75].  For this one, we use more recent data—the last 14 days—so \\nthat helps identify new areas that could be affected by the pandemic.  What you see here is \\nthat most of our high-incidence areas are in the central part of the county.  Those areas \\nbelong more to the City of Las Vegas and the City of North Las Vegas.  What you see to the \\nright is the east area of Las Vegas:  ZIP Codes 89110, 89142, and the others.  Those are the \\nareas where we consistently have seen the largest impact of the pandemic.  These areas also \\nare highly populated by members of the Hispanic community as well. \\n \\nThis is the first day the vaccine arrived in Clark County [page 76].  It was December 14, and \\nwe distributed the vaccine immediately, as soon as we received it.  Actually, that very first \\nday, we had a POD at one of our local hospitals and then we continued distributing the \\nvaccine through the valley during that week. \\n \\nI also want to mention that for the vaccination campaign we have developed a very strong \\npartnership with the county and local jurisdictions and also with local universities:  Touro \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 8, 2021 \\nPage 21 \\n \\nUniversity Nevada, UNLV, Roseman University of Health Sciences, the College of Southern \\nNevada, and other institutions.  All of them are participating in the pandemic whether it is \\nsupporting PODs or providing staff to participate in our operations.  We also have met with \\nrepresentatives of churches in the valley, the business community, and representatives of the \\nHispanic and African American communities as well.  We also have communications and \\npresentations with the Asian community through the Filipino nursing association and their \\npartners. \\n \\nAt  this  point  in  Clark  County,  we  have  administered  more  than  200,000  doses—until \\nyesterday, it was 214,000 doses.  Those were distributed all over the county.  We have big \\nvaccination sites at Cashman Center, and we offer vaccinations at Western High School, at \\nJerome Mack Middle School on the east side of the city, and at Eldorado High School.   \\nRecently we opened the Las Vegas Convention Center to offer second-dose vaccinations.   \\n \\nI also wanted to share with you some data regarding the vaccine here.  Fifty-eight percent of \\nthe people who received the vaccine are females.  That might be because of the weight of \\nhealth care workers in this population.  Health care workers at this point represent more than \\n40 percent of the individuals who have been vaccinated in Clark County. \\n \\nAlso, in terms of race and ethnicity, 41 percent are white, 10 percent Asian, 10 percent \\nHispanic, 6 percent African American, and about 30 percent of the individuals are either \\n\"other\" or \"unknown,\" complicating the issue of race/ethnicity analysis, but it is important to \\nknow that.  In terms of who administered the vaccine, 64,000 doses have been administered \\nby  hospitals,  representing  more  than  30  percent  of  both  doses;  58  percent  has  been \\nadministered by the health district at Cashman Center.   \\n \\nThis  is  a  ZIP  Code  map  showing  the  distribution  of  doses  in  Clark  County  [page  79, \\nExhibit C].  What we want to highlight here is that until last week, the numbers in Clark \\nCounty of vaccine distributed did not match what was happening with the incidence of \\nCOVID-19 in Clark County [page 80].  To the left is the incidence-by-ZIP-Code map.  To \\nthe right is the vaccine-administered map.  The vaccine-administered map does not match \\ngeographically the incidence-by-ZIP-Code map.   \\n \\nAs  you  probably  are  aware,  there  were  recent  comments  or  declarations  about  health \\ninequality in Clark County and the way that we distribute the vaccine.  I believe those were \\nunfair because until now, more than 40 percent of the vaccines have been distributed to \\nhealth care workers.  Also, we have issues with the race/ethnicity analysis in terms of the \\nweight of the unknown and other groups.   \\n \\nHaving said that, we do have a plan on how to address the health inequalities in Clark \\nCounty.  In addition to the large vaccination sites that we have and are planning for in the \\nfuture, we will be targeting some communities with smaller teams and PODs in collaboration \\nwith elected officials and representatives of community-based organizations and churches in \\nthose areas.  When we offer the vaccine at those sites, most of the population who receive the \\nvaccine will be the ones who actually live in the area.   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 8, 2021 \\nPage 22 \\n \\nThis issue is important to mention.  I was reading an article in The New York Times recently \\nthat mentioned health inequalities in this country.  An example was given of some large \\nmetropolitan areas deploying large vaccination sites mostly in affluent areas because it was \\neasier to do that.  This is not the case in Clark County.  Our PODs are all within the areas \\nwhere we have more cases; Cashman Center is just in the middle of all that action, as are all \\nthose schools where we have opened PODs.  Those large vaccination PODs do not allow for \\nthat kind of control, and that is why we emphasize a small operation when it comes to health \\ninequality.  The thing is that the vaccination is open to everybody, and we want everybody to \\nreceive it. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nDo you have any kind of breakdown by Assembly districts of COVID-19 positivity and \\nvaccination rates that you might be able to provide the Committee with, even if it is only by \\nZIP Code?  That question is also for our previous presenters if they are still on the line. \\n \\nFermin Leguen: \\nYes, I will ask our data people because that most likely will require census tracts; ZIP Codes \\nare very unlikely to match the area. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nThank you for your presentation.  A lot of times people did not know exactly what the health \\ndistricts did or what they are responsible for.  Now we have a pandemic that they are \\nresponsible for, and we appreciate all the challenges and the unique and creative responses \\nyour agencies are trying to accommodate and thrive in this situation.        \\n \\nWith that, I will close the presentation.  Do we have anyone for public comment?  [There \\nwas no one.]   \\n \\nWednesday\\'s agenda includes an overview of mental health in Nevada.  In addition, we will \\nhear from the Division of Public and Behavioral Health within the Department of Health and \\nHuman Services.  These are important topics for us to know about as a Committee going \\nforward with some of the bills we will be seeing.  We will also have presentations from the \\nregional behavioral health policy boards.  I will ask everyone to come prepared for the two \\nbills we will be hearing.  The first is Assembly Bill 62.  If you want to obtain more \\ninformation about the Nevada ABLE Savings Program which was addressed last session, \\nI will  have  links  sent  to  you.    Our  first  bill  draft,  Assembly  Joint  Resolution  1  from \\nAssemblywoman Titus, will also be presented.  Again, reach out to our policy analyst or our \\nlegal counsel if you have any questions while reviewing those bills.      \\n  \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 8, 2021 \\nPage 23 \\n \\nAre there any comments or questions from Committee members?

Today, we have presentations on mental health in \\nNevada and hearings on two bills. \\n \\nBefore we begin, I would like to make several housekeeping announcements.  Agenda items \\nmay be taken in a different order than listed.  Two or more agenda items may be combined \\nfor consideration, an item may be removed from the agenda, or discussion of an item may be \\ndelayed at any time.   \\n \\nThis virtual meeting format via Zoom is important to keep everyone safe during the COVID-\\n19 pandemic.  Members of the public may provide testimony in several different ways, all of \\nwhich are listed on the agenda.  Right now, you can register to participate online through the \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 10, 2021 \\nPage 3 \\n \\nLegislature\\'s website on the Nevada Electronic Legislative Information System (NELIS) or \\nby sending your comments directly to our staff.  \\n \\nAny committee exhibits may be submitted electronically.  Our members can see them online, \\nas well as the public, and we try our best to keep those up to date so you can have access to \\nthem before our meetings.  If you are not able to submit public comment over the telephone, \\nat the end of the meeting, or during the bill presentations today, you will be able to do so in \\nwriting up to 48 hours after our meeting adjournment. \\n \\nWe will now begin our first agenda item.  There will be an opportunity for limited comments \\nor questions from Committee members, but our policy analyst will send out our presenters\\' \\ncontact information; so if you are not able to ask your questions today under these limited \\ncircumstances, I encourage you to reach out to them.  They have been very forthcoming with \\ninformation when I have needed it, as I am sure they will be with you.  Now I would like to \\nstart off with our first presentation from the Department of Health and Human Services. \\n \\nStephanie  Woodard,  Senior  Advisor  on  Behavioral  Health,  Division  of  Public  and \\nBehavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services: \\nWe are here today to provide a brief overview of the State of Nevada\\'s behavioral health \\nsystem  and  to  discuss  the  impacts  of  COVID-19  on  behavioral  health  in  Nevada  and \\nopportunities for behavioral health going forward [Exhibit C].  This presentation is intended \\nto be very high-level as an introduction to the state system; we recognize from the outset that \\nthe behavioral health system is vast and incredibly complex.  We are not going to be able to \\ngo into much detail here; however, both Dr. Megan Freeman and I are available for questions \\nfollowing this presentation as well as offline if there are any specific issues or topics you \\nwould like to learn more about. \\n \\nThere are lots of different departments and divisions within the State of Nevada that have \\ntouchpoints to behavioral health and play critical roles in ensuring that services and supports \\nare provided within other systems such as criminal justice [page 2].  But the Division of \\nPublic and Behavioral Health (DPBH), the Division of Child and Family Services (DCFS), \\nand  the  Division  of  Health  Care  Financing  and  Policy  all  function  together  under  the \\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to provide essential elements for the \\nstatewide, community-based, behavioral health system.  Behavioral health in Nevada has \\nevolved over the past decade, especially with implementation of the Patient Protection and \\nAffordable Care Act.  These state-driven systems have helped to expand access to care when \\npreviously  the  state  itself  was  the  largest  behavioral  health  provider  in  Nevada.    This \\nevolution has required a concerted effort and coordination across divisions within DHHS, \\nand DPBH serves as the state mental health authority and the single state authority for \\nsubstance abuse treatment and prevention. \\n \\nCollectively, the three divisions work together to plan, regulate, and provide oversight, \\ntraining and technical assistance, and financing to this complex system.  In order for us to do \\nthe planning and oversight we provide to the state behavioral health system, we have several \\nboards and commissions that help guide our work [page 3].  These include the State Board of \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 10, 2021 \\nPage 4 \\n \\nHealth, the regional behavioral health policy boards, the Behavioral Health Planning and \\nAdvisory Council, and the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Agency Advisory \\nBoard.  Collectively, these have, in one way or another, an opportunity to provide planning, \\noversight, regulation, and advocacy for behavioral health in Nevada. \\n \\nThe DPBH has several priorities moving into this biennium, and they include things like \\nevidence-based forensic services, improved behavioral health through promotion, prevention, \\nearly  intervention,  and  access  to  quality  behavioral  health  services,  and  continuing  to \\nimprove inter- and intra-agency communication and collaboration [page 4, Exhibit C]. \\n \\nThis  is  a  brief  summary  of  what  the  behavioral  health  system  looks  like  in  Nevada, \\nspecifically as it relates to DPBH.  As the state mental health authority, we have direct \\nservices in both civil and forensic.  We also provide a high level of policy advisement, and \\nwe manage a number of federal and state grants that are often passed through to community \\nprograms to assist in prevention programming as well as to support community behavioral \\nhealth  providers  to  establish  new  programs.    We  work  with  those  programs  toward \\nsustainability, and we use some of the funding to help provide services for individuals who \\nare uninsured or underinsured [pages 5-7].  The behavioral health system also includes the \\nBureau of Health Care Quality and Compliance.  They often assist with the licensure of \\nhealth  care  facilities  including  some  of  the  foundational  facilities  that  are  part  of  the \\nbehavioral  health  system  in  Nevada.    Then  we  have  administrative  services  which  are \\nabsolutely essential for us to be able to administer the grant funds we receive. \\n \\nFor our clinical services on the civil side we have two inpatient psychiatric hospitals, one \\neach in Washoe and Clark Counties [pages 8 and 9].  The access to inpatient services usually \\nis for an individual who is admitted under an emergency through a mental health crisis; \\nhowever, they do also have voluntary admissions.  There are also several outpatient clinics \\nthat make up a network of care within our state.  There are four of these clinics in urban \\nareas—three in Clark County and one in Washoe County—as well as eighteen community-\\nbased clinics throughout rural Nevada. \\n \\nAccess to outpatient services is completely voluntary unless the individual has been ordered \\nto mental health court or to assisted outpatient treatment.  It is important to note that our civil \\nservice  outpatient  programs  really  do  provide  the  safety  net  services  for  individuals  in \\nNevada who are uninsured or underinsured.  They also work very closely in collaboration \\nwith community partners to provide a no-wrong-door approach on the campuses of both the \\nNorthern  Nevada  Adult  Mental  Health  Services—Dini-Townsend  Hospital—and  the \\nSouthern Nevada Adult Mental Health Services.  But they also provide coordination of care \\nwith many community-based programs.  In addition to the community-based programs they \\nwork in, they also provide an array of services related to outpatient mental health services. \\n \\nOn the forensic side, we have two hospitals in Nevada—Lakes Crossing Center in Sparks \\nand  the  Stein  Hospital  forensic  facility  in  southern  Nevada  [pages  10-12].    These  two \\nhospitals care for individuals who are working toward restoration of competency.  They have \\nlong-term inpatient forensic programs for individuals who are committed to the division, and \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 10, 2021 \\nPage 5 \\n \\nthey are serving individuals who were acquitted as not guilty by reason of insanity.  These \\nforensic hospitals have been working very hard over the last several years to assist in \\naddressing  the  federal  consent  decree  around  the  inability  of  the  state\\'s  single  forensic \\nhospital to admit all court-ordered referrals in a timely manner.  They have recently been able \\nto move out of the consent decree, but it is important to acknowledge that the forensic \\nhospitals remain at or near full capacity.  Although the consent decree has expired without \\npenalties or further oversight, the state is continuously focused on careful management in \\norder to meet demand and avoid any other legal challenges. \\n \\nThose are the two areas where there are direct clinical services that are provided within the \\nDivision of Public and Behavioral Health on both the civil and forensic side, but as we have \\nworked to move away from being the largest behavioral health provider in Nevada and to \\nbuild capacity at the community level, we have recognized the need for additional support to \\nhelp build that community capacity.  The behavioral health policy unit works to administer \\nthe  majority  of  our  large  federal  funding  streams  that  are  used  to  address  specific \\npopulations, including those who are uninsured and underinsured [page 13, Exhibit C].  This \\nalso requires the policy division to work on additional supports such as technical assistance, \\nstrategic planning, and implementation of systems within the state and in communities. \\n \\nSome of the behavioral health policy areas of focus include addressing minority health \\ninequity and disparities and supporting evidence-based practices.  After COVID-19, we did a \\nlot to help support community agencies to fully implement telehealth and to focus on suicide \\nprevention and crisis services. \\n \\nThat is my very brief overview of the behavioral health system as it relates to the Division of \\nPublic and Behavioral Health, and now I will hand this presentation over to Dr. Megan \\nFreeman at the Division of Child and Family Services to provide a similar overview of their \\nsystem.   \\n \\nMegan Freeman, Clinical and Policy Advisor on Children\\'s Behavioral Health, Division \\nof Child and Family Services, Department of Health and Human Services: \\nThank you for the opportunity to present to you on children\\'s mental health [Exhibit D].  \\nToday I would like to give you an overview of our agency operations and explain how our \\nwork shapes the children\\'s mental health system in Nevada.  On this slide [page 3], you will \\nsee our agency vision and mission.  In trying to improve conditions for youth in every \\nNevada community, we seek to break down barriers to access to care in every region across \\nthe state, to eliminate disproportionality in our systems, and to meet the needs of special \\npopulations.   \\n \\nIn  addition  to  our  agency  vision  and  mission,  three  regional  children\\'s  mental  health \\nconsortia guide the growth and development of our children\\'s mental health system.  The \\nmakeup and roles of the children\\'s mental health consortia are defined in Nevada Revised \\nStatutes, and the consortia chairs and I will speak to this Committee on February 15 in more \\ndetail about this [page 4]. \\n \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 10, 2021 \\nPage 6 \\n \\nNext, I would like to touch on another important value system that guides our work.  Nearly \\n30 years ago, a federal initiative known as the Children\\'s Mental Health Initiative was \\nauthorized to facilitate the delivery of comprehensive community mental health services to \\nchildren and youth.  Through this initiative, hundreds of demonstration grants, cooperative \\nagreements,  and  expansion  grants  have  been  funded  throughout  the  United  States  to \\nencourage the widespread adoption of what is called the \"system of care\" approach.  The \\nDivision of Child and Family Services (DCFS) has received three grants under the Children\\'s \\nMental Health Initiative and is committed to the system of care (SOC) approach.  The core \\nvalues of an SOC approach include providing services and creating systems that are family-\\ndriven and youth-guided.  The services are community-based, accessible, and provided in the \\nleast  restrictive  environment,  and  services  and  systems  are  culturally  and  linguistically \\nappropriate [page 5, Exhibit D].  The Division of Child and Family Services\\' operations are \\ndivided into four separate areas, which you can see here [page 6].  In 2019, DCFS underwent \\nan internal reorganization to move away from our traditional orientation around children\\'s \\nmental health, child welfare, and juvenile justice services.  This resulted in new coordination \\nof our services around community-based services, residential or 24-hour services, and quality \\nand  oversight.    Since  the  reorganization,  we  have  been  working  to  break  down  silos, \\nincorporate children\\'s mental health programming throughout the child and family services \\nsystem, and incorporate continuous quality improvement into all programs at all levels to \\nbetter serve youth—many of whom touch multiple of our systems. \\n \\nIn our community services area are located all our outpatient, mobile, and other community-\\nbased services including child protective and welfare services for rural Nevada.  We offer \\nservices for ages 0 to 17, or into the early 20s if the youth is still enrolled in K-12 school.  \\nWe primarily serve Medicaid fee-for-service, uninsured, underinsured, and undocumented \\nfamilies.  For some programs such as our mobile crisis response team, we serve any family in \\nneed at no cost.   \\n \\nThe focus of our residential services programs is 24-hour care.  This includes acute care, \\nresidential treatment, and juvenile justice youth facilities.  Our youth facilities are focused on \\nprogramming and not on punishment.  Per policy, every youth receives an assessment for \\nmental health and substance-use treatment needs, and treatment is provided as needed.  Our \\nyouth facilities also operate under a recently modernized suicide prevention policy.   \\n \\nOur quality and oversight area is focused on policy, quality assurance, and DCFS in its \\noversight/regulatory role as a state agency.  Additionally, our systems advocate is located in \\nthe quality and oversight area.  This position functions as our public information officer and \\nlegislative liaison.   \\n \\nDivision of Child and Family Services administrative services are focused on support and \\ninfrastructure with the additional recent expansion of our victims services area.  Nevada\\'s \\nVictims of Crime Program is located here and provides financial support to individuals who \\nhave been the victims of violent crimes.  Additionally, victims services holds Nevada\\'s \\nAntiterrorism and Emergency Assistance Program, a $16 million multiyear award to support \\nvictims  of  the  Route  91  Harvest  Festival  shooting  on  October  1,  2017,  in  Las  Vegas.  \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 10, 2021 \\nPage 7 \\n \\nBehavioral health support is a main focus of recovery for Route 91 survivors.  Finally, \\nthrough our victims of crime funding, we are providing funding for innovative programming \\nthat  addresses  the  needs  of  children  exposed  to  domestic  violence  and  for  victims  of \\ncommercial sexual exploitation, including children. \\n \\nIn  2020,  our  psychiatric  residential  treatment  facilities  achieved  accreditation  by  the \\nCommission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF).  This was a multiyear, \\nhighly intensive process that has resulted in more in-state beds for youth with higher levels of \\nneed.  In the coming biennium, residential services will be focused on implementing the \\nBuilding  Bridges  program—a  set  of  best  practices  for  transforming  systems  to  create \\npartnerships and collaboration between families, youth, advocates, service providers, and \\noversight agencies.  A primary goal of the Building Bridges program is to sustain positive \\noutcomes after a discharge from residential placement. \\n \\nOn the next slide [page 8, Exhibit D] you will see our two active sources of competitive \\nfederal funding including our pediatric mental health care access grant which works to \\nintegrate pediatric psychiatry and behavioral health consultation services into rural primary \\ncare.  Our system of care expansion grant has multiple goals, but the overarching objective is \\nsystem  improvement  which  will  expand  the  service  array  in  rural  Nevada  and  provide \\ninfrastructure to grow DCFS\\'s capacity to serve in an oversight role for children\\'s behavioral \\nhealth.  In particular, this system of care grant will expand access to wraparound services, \\nrespite  care,  and  family  care  support.    We  have  also  been  focused  on  supporting  the \\nimplementation of a 1915(i) Medicaid state plan amendment to expand the service array for \\nyouth in specialized foster care, also known as treatment foster care for youth with intensive \\nbehavioral health needs.   \\n \\nIn our community services area, it is important to highlight the work of our mobile crisis \\nresponse teams as a primary method or point of entry for families to access services and \\nbecome matched to the correct services and supports for their needs [page 9].  Using some \\nemergency  COVID-19  funding,  we  were  able  to  temporarily  expand  the  mobile  crisis \\nprogram to meet increased need and create additional teams, as well as expand our ability to \\nprovide telehealth services 24/7 statewide when previously, statewide 24/7 response was only \\navailable in Las Vegas.  However, the funding is temporary. \\n \\nFinally,  within  community  services,  tiered  care  coordination  is  available  to  youth  with \\nmultiple system needs, in order to build the family\\'s capacity to meet their youth\\'s needs as \\nwell as match them to formal services and supports.  Tiered-care coordination includes High \\nFidelity Wraparound and a program called FOCUS for youth with intermediate-level needs. \\n \\nA lot of what we do is focused on direct services, but our quality and oversight area is where \\nwe focus more on policy and our regulatory role.  In our quality and oversight area we are \\ncurrently recruiting for a position that would be embedded in Nevada Medicaid to support \\npolicy  development  and  on-the-ground  technical  assistance  for  schools  implementing \\nMedicaid billing.  The position will have a particular focus on the Clark County School \\nDistrict as the largest district in the state. \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 10, 2021 \\nPage 8 \\n \\nLooking to the future, there are significant workforce needs in quality and oversight.  The \\nDivision of Child and Family Services would like to move forward with becoming the \\nchildren\\'s mental health authority in Nevada, which would allow us to set provider standards, \\nrun a technical assistance and training center for evidence-based practices, and provide \\noversight and quality assurance to ensure that providers using public funding for mental and \\nbehavioral health care for children are adhering to standards in quality criteria.  We currently \\nlack the staffing necessary to stand up the technical assistance and training center or to scale \\nup  oversight  and  quality  assurance.    By  creating  an  infrastructure  for  widespread \\ndissemination and oversight of evidence-based practices, particularly home and community-\\nbased services, we can follow the footsteps of other communities that have returned youth \\nfrom out-of-state placements, closed residential treatment centers and juvenile justice centers, \\nand achieved the system of care expansion goal of curating an array of effective, evidence-\\nbased, community-based treatment options.  Our previous system of care grant identified the \\nneed for a children\\'s mental health authority, and we were planning to begin those efforts \\nduring this legislative session.  Given the current budget constraints, we are looking at \\nalternate ways to begin this work.  Our current system of care grant provides the theoretical \\nframework in initial funding to build the beginning infrastructure for the children\\'s mental \\nhealth authority.  However, we need a sustainable plan to position DCFS as the entity \\nin Nevada  that  ensures  children,  youth,  and  families  receive  the  best  possible  mental \\nand behavioral health care so they can achieve their goals.  I will now turn this over to \\nDr. Woodard to continue the presentation on behavioral health needs in Nevada.  \\n \\nStephanie Woodard: \\nRecognizing  that  we  have  time  constraints  today,  you  have  been  provided  with  slides \\n[Exhibit E] as well as with a few final slides on the two previous presentations which provide \\nsome links to additional resources that may be helpful if you wish to learn more about any  of \\nthe topics we discussed today. \\n \\nWe will now look at behavioral health in Nevada and the impact of COVID-19.  It is \\nimportant to recognize that COVID-19 as a pandemic is considered a disaster.  Looking at \\nhow we can best estimate the impact of COVID-19 on behavioral health in Nevada and \\ninternationally, we have had to look at an existing body of research that helps us to better \\nunderstand what the impact of previous disasters has had on behavioral health.  As a disaster, \\nCOVID-19 has impacted virtually everyone in one way or another.  Individuals who have \\nbeen most directly impacted may have the most adverse experiences when it comes to \\nresponding  to  COVID-19.    We  have  looked  at  a  body  of  literature  related  to  disaster \\nbehavioral health to help us better conceptualize what we needed to address in the response \\nand recovery efforts [page 2].   \\n \\nMost disasters have a very clear beginning, middle, and end, and when they do, there is a \\ntypical trajectory in which individuals will experience different types of stressors at different \\nmagnitudes throughout their response and recovery time periods.  This is the best model we \\nhave had in order to better anticipate what the impacts on behavioral health could be related \\nto COVID-19 [page 3].  However, we recognize that there are some significant limitations to \\nusing this model.  One of the primary limitations is that this model assumes that there is a \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 10, 2021 \\nPage 9 \\n \\nvery clear beginning, middle, and end to a disaster, and as we all know with COVID-19, it \\nhas  had  a  very  prolonged  existence  in  Nevada  and  the  recovery—although  coming—is \\nrelatively slow.  We also recognize that the recovery from an impact such as a hurricane or \\ntornado tends to follow a normal trajectory where there is an opportunity for inventory and \\ncommunity  cleanup  and  engagement.    However,  in  COVID-19,  we  have  experienced \\nsomething that is very different.   \\n \\nOne of the best ways for us to conceptualize the impacts of COVID-19 is to look at the stress \\ncontinuum [page 4, Exhibit E].  We recognize that there are different impacts depending on \\ndifferent degrees of stress.  This includes individuals who are experiencing healthy amounts \\nof stress all the way to individuals who have experienced incredibly prolonged exposures to \\nhigh degrees of stress.  What we know from previous disasters is that individuals who were \\nalready experiencing high degrees of distress prior to the disaster are most likely to continue \\nto experience moderate to severe levels of distress during and post the disaster.  However, we \\nalso know there are several impacts that a disaster can cause such as economic uncertainty, \\nhousing instability, as well as grief from experiencing bereavement that can also contribute to \\nhigh levels of stressor.  How long an individual is experiencing high degrees of stress can \\nimpact  how  vulnerable  they  are  to  either  having  difficulty  in  coping  or  beginning  to \\nexperience the onset of behavioral health conditions. \\n \\nWe  were  fortunate  in  Nevada  to  be  eligible  for  what  is  called  the  Crisis  Counseling \\nAssistance and Training Program grant through the Federal Emergency Management Agency \\n(FEMA) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) \\nafter the declaration of the emergency was approved in April 2020.  To formulate how we as \\na  state  were  going  to respond  to the  behavioral  health  needs  in  Nevada  subsequent  to \\nCOVID-19, we developed, along with FEMA and SAMHSA, this population exposure model \\n[page 5].  This model allows us to better understand what the potential impacts are for \\ndifferent populations, including vulnerable populations, so we could target our responses and \\nresources based on the level of exposure or the potential for significant distress due to \\nCOVID-19. \\n \\nAt the very bottom, we have prioritized those individuals who are bereaved or who have \\nexperienced a hospitalization, recognizing that both those events could be incredibly difficult \\nfor someone to manage.  We also prioritized frontline health workers, especially knowing \\nthat we have been experiencing a considerable medical surge as of late.  We see that frontline \\nhealth workers, as well as emergency responders, have really been shouldering a lot of the \\nburden  related  to  the  response  to  COVID-19.    We  recognize  that  it  is  not  only  those \\nindividuals who have been directly impacted, but the secondary and tertiary impacts that \\nCOVID-19 has had on individuals.  This could also be loss of employment, students who \\nhave been disconnected from school, and other individuals in the community who have been \\nresponding to COVID-19. \\n \\nWe have been able to respond in a number of different ways [page 6].  Some highlights from \\nour response and recovery activities include training well over 700 people in psychological \\nfirst aid.  We have worked with the Nevada Hospital Association on engaging hospitals in \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 10, 2021 \\nPage 10 \\n \\ncrisis  standards  of  care  around  behavioral  health,  crisis  services,  and  emergency  room \\ndiversion.  We have worked to establish 24/7 psychiatric triage centers for children, adults, \\nand adolescents to help divert them from emergency rooms.  We have developed some \\nprogramming  and  public  service  announcements,  including  our  \"Home  but  Not  Alone\" \\ncampaign,  to  get  the  message  out  to  help  individuals  understand  where  resources  are \\navailable should they need them. \\n \\nStarting in March 2020, within DCFS and DPBH we developed a behavioral health task \\nforce that began to look at some of the data available to help us better understand what the \\nimmediate needs and impacts were so we could develop our response strategies [page 7, \\nExhibit E].  Collectively, we authored the COVID-19 behavioral health recovery plan in May \\n2020.  The plan spans a number of different areas we had identified as priorities with an \\nemphasis on promotion, prevention, and early intervention.  It also helped us identify, if we \\nreceived additional federal funds, which we have, how we would plan to allocate that funding \\nto some of the highest needs. \\n \\nThe Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program [page 8] funded the development of \\nthe Nevada Resilience Project, which has allowed Nevada to hire a number of resilience \\nambassadors statewide, with a focus on intervening and providing promotion, prevention, \\nand early intervention for individuals who are struggling with stressors related to COVID-19.  \\nThis helps us direct them to needed resources as well as to reduce stress and build on coping \\nskills.  We have worked with a number of community partners including the Human Services \\nAgency of Washoe County, the Boys & Girls Club of Truckee Meadows, the Boys & Girls \\nClubs of Southern Nevada, and a number of other community organizations to ensure that \\nour resilience ambassadors are available statewide when and where an individual needs \\nadditional support.  With that, I will hand it over to Dr. Freeman. \\n \\nMegan Freeman: \\nI am going to talk now about the state of youth mental health in terms of mental health needs \\nbefore the pandemic, and what some of the impacts of the pandemic have been.  The \"State \\nof Mental Health in America\" is an annual report produced by Mental Health America, a \\ncommunity-based nonprofit utilizing national survey data.  As you can see, Nevada typically \\ndoes not fare well in the youth rankings [page 9].  We have been 51st for the past three years, \\nand the same is true for the overall rankings.  On Monday, you heard from Public and \\nBehavioral Health Deputy Administrator Julia Peek that, throughout public health in Nevada, \\nif there is a list that is good to be at the top of, we tend to be at the bottom.  In the youth \\nsection of the Mental Health America report there are seven indicators that make up these \\nrankings.  These indicators fall within the core general topic areas listed here.  Our biggest \\nareas of difficulty are in access to care and prevalence of substance use disorder among \\nyouth.    These  are  very  actionable  concerns  and  can  be  addressed  with  investments  in \\nscreening, prevention, and early intervention.  However, it will take resources and time to \\nmove the needle on these rankings. \\n \\nThe Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System is a population-level survey supported by the \\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and designed to monitor health risk \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 10, 2021 \\nPage 11 \\n \\nbehaviors,  identify  health  disparities,  and  monitor  the  effectiveness  of  public  health \\ninterventions.  The most recent data were collected in 2019 by the University of Nevada, \\nReno.  We do our own version of the survey here and sample more widely than the CDC \\ndoes.  The data were collected at all regular public, charter, and alternative high schools and \\nmiddle schools in Nevada.  This slide [page 10, Exhibit E] draws attention to some of the \\nmost important behavioral health findings from the survey, including up to two in five youth \\nstruggling with significant feelings of depression, up to one in five youth having seriously \\nconsidered suicide in the past year, and one in five youth engaging in self-harm.  On this \\nsame survey, 15 percent of middle schoolers and 56 percent of high schoolers reported that \\nthey never or rarely got the kind of help they needed when they felt sad, empty, hopeless, \\nangry, or anxious.  This data is consistent with our core national rankings on access to care.   \\n \\nOn this next slide [page 11], you will see the top ten diagnoses most commonly associated \\nwith Medicaid billing for behavioral health for youth ages 0-18.  These are 2019 numbers, so \\nthis was prior to the pandemic.  For the sake of time, I will leave this for reference, but you \\nwill notice that mood and anxiety disorders are prominent.     \\n \\nThese are some of the risk factors and stressors that youth and families are coping with right \\nnow [page 12].  I want to emphasize that isolation and loneliness are associated with risk of \\nfuture  mental  health  problems,  most  commonly  depression.    However,  while  youth  are \\nreporting increased anxiety, depression, and stress right now, some teenagers are actually \\nreporting increased life satisfaction which they say is because of more time for sleep, more \\ntime with family, and protection from some of the stressors of regular in-person life, like \\nbullying. \\n \\nOne of the major concerns that has been well documented throughout the pandemic is the \\nlack of adult eyes on children who would normally be interacting frequently with teachers, \\nschool staff, pediatricians, coaches, faith leaders, and in lots of other arenas.  We have seen a \\nsignificant drop in calls to child protective services (CPS) from educational professionals in \\nschools.    However,  over  time,  we  have  started  to  see  more  calls  coming  in  from  law \\nenforcement and other professionals such as physicians.  Total call numbers have returned to \\noverall seasonal patterns at a slightly decreased rate compared to prior years [page 13].  I see \\nthis as an overall systems success as our communities have adjusted to the needs and current \\ncircumstances. \\n \\nThis graph shows calls to our children\\'s mobile crisis response hotline [page 14].  You will \\nnotice the same general pattern as the CPS hotline calls—a large decrease at the onset of the \\npandemic followed by a gradual return to regular seasonal patterns.  For mobile crisis, the \\nreturn to normal happened when children returned to school in the fall.  This actually caused \\na spike in need, but it has remained high since that time. \\n \\nThis slide shows a change in the hospital diversion rate for mobile crisis [page 15].  This is \\nthe  number  of  youth  stabilized  safely  in  the  community  or  diverted  from  psychiatric \\nhospitalization.  Initially, mobile crisis saw a decrease in hospital diversion, indicating that \\nmore youth were being hospitalized.  The program reports that this is due to youth with more \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 10, 2021 \\nPage 12 \\n \\nserious levels of risk presenting for care and more difficulty in placing community supports \\naround the youth due to isolation and quarantine. \\n \\nI also want to make you aware of a national trend reported by the CDC in the fall.  Although \\nthe overall number of pediatric visits to emergency departments decreased by about 7 percent \\nduring  lock-down  and  stay-at-home  efforts,  the  proportion  of  visits  that  were  related \\nto behavioral health was 40-60 percent higher than normal during April through October \\n[page  16,  Exhibit  E].    Most  emergency  departments  lack  the  appropriate  resources  for \\nproviding behavioral health care, so we want to increase the availability of immediate in-\\ncrisis care when and where youth and families need to access it. \\n \\nFinally, I would like to address the topic of youth suicide.  On the blue bars on this chart \\n[page 17], you are looking at the total number of suicides for ages 0-17 for 2010 to 2020.  \\nThe dotted line is the national suicide rate, which has been increasing steadily over the past \\ndecade.  The black line is Nevada\\'s suicide rate, which has been fluctuating around the \\nnational rate. \\n \\nOn Monday, you heard a little bit about public health surveillance from Division of Public \\nand Behavioral Health Deputy Administrator Julia Peek.  She talked about how typically \\npublic  health  surveillance  does  not  occur  in  real  time,  and  youth  suicide  is  the  same.  \\nAlthough I know this topic has been in the news and in all our hearts recently, our 2020 \\nnumbers have not yet been finalized through the Office of Vital Statistics, so they could \\nchange from what you see here.  It is too early to draw conclusions about how the pandemic \\nhas changed the youth suicide rates in Nevada or anywhere.  What we do know so far about \\nthe impact of the pandemic on suicide in Nevada is that our 2020 total is not out of the realm \\nof what is normal for Nevada over the past decade. \\n \\nI am a parent.  One fatality is too many, and we strive for zero suicides, but I would like to \\nencourage us as a public health system not to focus on fatalities as the only important \\nindicator  of  the  burden  of  suicide  in  Nevada.    That  is  why  we  are  putting  into  place \\nsyndromic surveillance at hospitals and urgent care centers to better understand the full \\nspectrum of help-seeking for suicidal behavior.  This is monitoring of the number of visits \\nwhere the person presents with a suicide attempt.  Additionally, we must continue to expand \\ncrisis services and provide outreach so that children, youth, families, and individuals who are \\nsuffering know where to go to get help.   \\n \\nStephanie Woodard: \\nI will take a little glimpse into the Mental Health America report, this time specific to adults \\nand mental health.  This report comes out annually and uses a number of different metrics to \\nlook at the progress, or lack thereof, that mental health services are having in specific states.  \\nHere you will see a number of different rankings [page 18].  The category of \"adults with any \\nmental illness\" has continued to increase.  Where Nevada is about 20 percent, the United \\nStates average is 19 percent.  In Nevada, the category of \"adults with a substance use \\ndisorder in the past year\" is at 9 percent where the United States is 7 percent.  These data are \\nfrom a study done in 2018.  One of the issues we have with these reports is because the data \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 10, 2021 \\nPage 13 \\n \\nis so outdated, sometimes it is very difficult to attribute what it is we are seeing in the data to \\nwhat we are seeing in the state here and now.  But we do use these as indicators to be able to \\nmeasure progress as we look at this data year over year. \\n \\nI also want to note that there have been some improvements in some of the areas related to \\nadult mental health, including a reduction in adults expressing serious thoughts of suicide and \\nadults with any mental illness who did not receive treatment.  We actually have increased the \\nnumber of individuals who may have needed treatment and did receive treatment.  As for \\nadults with cognitive disability who did not see a doctor due to cost, we have seen a good \\nreduction in those numbers, which has enhanced our scores here.  The reason I think it is \\nimportant to discuss these data is because far too often we hear people use the shortcut that \\nNevada ranks fifty-first, but there are a lot of nuanced data points that go into that overall \\nranking.  It is important to look in a more detailed fashion to understand what could be \\ndriving some of our rankings [page 19, Exhibit E].  As was pointed out, the rate of suicide in \\nNevada in 2020 specific for youth was not unusual compared to years past, and we see \\nsimilar trends across all age groups including adults and individuals aged 65.  Again, I want \\nto caution that these data are preliminary and subject to change.   \\n \\nWe have experienced an increase in opioid overdose deaths over the course of COVID-19 \\n[page 20].  We had seen a relatively steady reduction over the last few years, but now we \\nhave seen the highest rate we have had in the past decade with 484 fatalities in 2020.  There \\nare a lot of reasons why this could be, not the least of which are increase in isolation and lack \\nof access to care.  In November we had a red alert through the national drug helpline which \\nnoted that Nevada had a 50 percent increase in overdose deaths between the first and second \\nquarters of 2020.  Much of this is driven by non-COVID-19-related issues, including the \\nproliferation of synthetic opioids including fentanyl.  We have been seeing this troubling \\ntrend growing nationally even pre-COVID-19, but we realize that COVID-19 could have had \\na significant impact in changing some of these numbers in Nevada.  We have also seen an \\nincrease in emergency room (ER) utilization rates for individuals with suspected opioid-\\nrelated emergency department encounters.  We had a 26 percent increase in 2020, while the \\noverall drug-related emergency department use increased only 3 percent.  So, while we saw a \\n3 percent increase overall, the vast majority—26 percent—was related to opioid overdoses.  \\nWe are seeing an increase in utilization within Medicaid for substance use disorder, and we \\nsaw  a  pretty  significant  increase in  2020  for  individuals  in  the  Medicaid  programming \\naccepting substance use disorder treatment services [page 21]. \\n \\nWe have been watching very closely a number of different indicators to help us better \\nunderstand what is happening with traditional behavioral health service utilization.  We have \\nnot seen a very significant increase in overall utilization during COVID-19 [page 22].  There \\nare a number of different reasons for this, not the least of which is that we did have a \\nsubstantial time period where we had stay-at-home orders, and we know that individuals \\nhave been avoiding care.  We also know that, following disasters, we typically see an \\nincrease  in  need  for  traditional  behavioral  health  services  between  12  and  18  months \\nfollowing the anniversary of the appearance of the disaster.  We anticipate that we may see \\nincreased needs for services moving forward following March 2021.  We have seen an \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 10, 2021 \\nPage 14 \\n \\nincrease in crisis services.  We have seen a 170 percent increase in calls to the warm-line and \\nincreases in both acuity and the length of calls for our lifeline for crisis support services of \\nNevada.  Through the Nevada Resilience Project, which is about promotion, prevention, and \\nearly intervention, we have been able to serve almost 73,000 individuals statewide since \\nJune.  Our COVID-19 ER grant recipients who are providing crisis triage and inpatient \\nservices have seen an approximately 100 percent increase year over year in individuals \\nlooking to access care.  We continue to watch and monitor to see what the impact could be \\non overall traditional behavioral health services, and currently, we have not seen a significant \\nincrease.   \\n \\nWhere  we  have  seen  a  nice  change  is  in  telehealth  [page  23,  Exhibit  E].    Telehealth \\nutilization for behavioral health services helped with continuity of care for individuals who \\nhad previously been engaged in behavioral health services.  But we also saw a marked \\nincrease in individuals who initiated treatment services utilizing telehealth.  Pre-COVID-19, \\napproximately 24 percent of individuals had had their initial visit via telehealth, and that \\nmoved to 41 percent of initial visits during the six months following March 2020.   \\n \\nThere is certainly a lot of work to do in the road ahead [pages 24 and 25].  We have to \\nrecognize that there is a risk for increased and severe distress as it relates to our economic \\nrecovery; the more prolonged this recovery is, the more likely that individuals will continue \\nto experience distress.  We have to recognize there is a risk for increased suffering among \\nchildren, parents, and caregivers due to isolation, loneliness, and stress related to school \\nclosures as they persist.  We must address the needs for individuals who are struggling to \\ncope  and  manage  with  new  or  ongoing  stressors,  and  recognize  the  opportunities  for \\nprevention and early intervention as recovery continues. \\n \\nSome of our priorities are to prioritize basic systems that help keep people safe and secure, \\nfocusing on social determinants of health such as economic factors—food security, housing \\nstability, access to health care, and access to education.  We need increased capacity to \\nprovide school-based behavioral health care for children.  We need to continue efforts to \\npromote, prevent, and intervene early when individuals are having difficulty coping; provide \\ncrisis services for individuals and families when and where they need them, to include \\nsuicide prevention; and continue efforts to build community and family resilience. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nYou did an amazing job, and I know I asked a lot by asking you to consolidate everything \\nthat is going on in this mental health field.  We do have a couple of questions. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Peters: \\nI echo what the Chair said about getting all that information to us in such a shortened period \\nof time.  I have a question related to your data.  Are there any data gaps you have identified?  \\nWe need to ensure that we have all the information we need to develop response policies, to \\nbe certain we are getting those resources to children and families when and where they need \\nthem. \\n \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 10, 2021 \\nPage 15 \\n \\nMegan Freeman: \\nAn amazing thing about Nevada is that we are collecting a ton of data on children.  We have \\ndata on crisis teams, and we get a lot of data through the schools.  There are a couple of \\ndifferent initiatives on collecting data through the schools.  Right now, we need to focus our \\nefforts on suicide prevention.  We would like to be getting more real-time information from \\nhospital emergency departments and urgent cares about individuals across the lifespan who \\nare presenting with suicidal behaviors.  That will help us understand in more recent or more \\nreal time what the needs are and who has the need—where we need to focus our prevention \\nefforts. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Peters: \\nThat is great to hear.  I have been working with Dr. Woodard on a bill that I hope will help \\nallow us to fill that data gap in particular. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Titus: \\nI  appreciate  Dr.  Woodard  and  Dr.  Freeman  presenting  today.    I  know  it  was  a  lot  of \\ninformation in a short amount of time.  I have questions regarding slides 8 and 18 [pages 8 \\nand 18, Exhibit E].  Nevada continues to be fifty-first in all those data points—the worst of \\nthe worst, as you pointed out.  This is my fourth session.  I have seen presentations every \\nsession because I have been on this Health and Human Services Committee each time.  We \\nare not moving that needle at all.  Each time we hear these presentations, we talk about \\ncollecting data.  At some point, we have to make some changes because, before I am termed \\nout, I would love to see some of those needles moving and that there is some improvement.  \\nI have not heard anything more than that you are collecting more data.  I am not hearing any \\nsolutions.   \\n \\nI would like to know whether the number of childhood behavior specialists has increased.  \\nWhat are we doing about reaching out and educating folks so that we can get more providers \\nso there is more access to care?  I know we have more Medicaid recipients signed up, but \\nthat does not mean there is better access to care, and I have huge concerns about that.  At \\nsome point—you may not have that today, and we are limited for time—but I would like to \\nsee the number of providers available in your system.  What are we doing to outreach?  Are \\nwe using reciprocity to get these people licensed so there will be more access?  That is my \\nfirst question—what are you doing for the specialists these people see? \\n \\nMy  second  question  concerns telehealth  data.    You  said  we  have  increased  the  use  of \\ntelehealth from 24 percent to 41 percent, but that does not mean there has actually been \\nincreased access to care.  It means that maybe the individual was unable to get into the office \\nand might not otherwise be going to see that provider unless it was via telehealth.  I do not \\nknow that is actually a greater percentage of access, so I would like to see some data on what \\nwe are actually doing to have folks get access to care.  At the end of the day, follow-up \\naccess to care, getting into treatment programs, and having specialists available for adults \\nand children is really when we are going to start solving these problems, so perhaps you can \\nget us more information on the actual providers. \\n \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 10, 2021 \\nPage 16 \\n \\nMegan Freeman: \\nI will briefly speak on your question and then it might be best for me to take this back to our \\ndivision leadership, and they can submit more information to you in writing.  One thing I will \\npoint out is Mental Health America reports in any given year are based on data that was \\ncollected three years prior.  It is very possible that we have made strides in the past three \\nyears that will not be reflected until we see the rankings on future years\\' reports.  We have \\nbeen working to expand our system of care in Nevada.  I think that is very significant for \\nchildren, and we just may not be seeing those numbers reflected yet in the report; however, \\nwe will submit a response to you in writing regarding your questions about providers and the \\nother aspects of your questions. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Titus: \\nThank you.  I do not think there is a person in this meeting who does not want to see Nevada \\nrise out of that fifty-first ranking in so many things, and I appreciate all you are doing. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \\nIs your department partnering with any national organizations or nonprofits to address some \\nof the mental health issues throughout the state?  Do you have any certified nonprofit \\norganizations able to go into the schools and give presentations to kids or do outreach and get \\nthe message out that there are resources and help available so people know more about them?  \\nIn southern Nevada, I am seeing a lot more open, frank discussion about mental health.  The \\nmore support we have for those conversations from your department, the better we will be \\nable to reach people in our community.          \\n  \\nMegan Freeman: \\nWe would love to partner with you to understand more about what you are seeing.  We can \\nget  you  a  list  of  our  community  and  national  partners  that  provide  us  with  technical \\nassistance.  We seek a lot of support and technical assistance, but there is always room for \\nimprovement, so we would love to have that conversation with you. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nIf there is any other documentation you have, please provide it to our policy analyst, and he \\ncan distribute it to all Committee members.  I also encourage everyone to reach out to our \\npresenters.  Their contact information has been provided to you, so you may follow up with \\nany additional offline conversations about what we can do in our state.  We will now move \\non  to  our  regional  behavioral  health  policy  boards.    I  have  basically  asked  almost  the \\nimpossible from our next presenters.  I have asked them to introduce themselves and give us \\na five-minute presentation each, so we will begin. \\n \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 10, 2021 \\nPage 17 \\n \\nValerie  Cauhape  Haskin,  Rural  Regional  Behavioral  Health  Coordinator,  Rural \\nRegional Behavioral Health Policy Board: \\nThere is a handout in your packet [Exhibit F] that accompanies this presentation [Exhibit G] \\nwhich  gives  far  more  detail  about  the  board  than  I  am  able  to  present  to  you  today.  \\nThe Rural  Regional  Behavioral  Health  Policy  Board  represents  a  six-county  region \\nin northeastern  Nevada  which  includes  Elko,  Eureka,  Humboldt,  Lander,  Pershing,  and \\nWhite Pine Counties.  The combined area of this region is slightly larger than the state of \\nMississippi, and the population sits at just under 100,000.  So, this large expansive space \\ncovered by the region and the geographic distance of specialty services influences a lot of our \\nboard\\'s priorities.  The priorities seen here were adopted by the board in early 2020 and will \\nbe revised and updated at the board\\'s next meeting on February 24 [pages 2 and 3, Exhibit F]. \\n \\nOne of the major issues community members in our region face is transportation, both to and \\nfrom behavioral health services.  This is the case for both crisis and noncrisis services.  While \\na person in crisis may be able to get emergency transportation to in-person services in Reno, \\nCarson City, or Las Vegas, our stakeholders have alerted us to many persons being released \\nfrom emergency care without direct transportation home.  In those cases, they may be stuck \\nin  the  city  where  they  were  released  or  sometimes  they  have  been  put  on  public \\ntransportation for the return home, often without medication, food, or water, and, due to \\nmultiple connections, this may take more than one day. \\n \\nInitially, the lion\\'s share of the persons in our regions seeking behavioral health care services \\nare either covered or eligible for Medicaid.  Thus, previous to the COVID-19 pandemic, it \\nwas a priority of the board to seek improved Medicaid reimbursement for behavioral health \\nservices to ensure the providers could maintain service levels to meet their needs.  Due to \\nbudgetary cuts and concerns over the last year, that conversation has changed to preserving \\nthe Medicaid services that are currently available. \\n \\nWhile most of the state can be considered health care service shortage areas, the issue is \\nexacerbated in our frontier communities and is often even worse in regard to behavioral \\nhealth services.  The board has prioritized seeking ways to improve the ability of local \\norganizations to recruit behavioral health providers, including improving paths to licensure \\nfor those who are moving to Nevada from out of state.  This is addressed in the board\\'s bill \\nthis legislative session, Senate Bill 44.   \\n \\nWhile  state  and  local  partners  have  made  great  strides  in  improving  data  quality  and \\ncommunication,  this  is  still  a  persistent  issue  within  our  region.    Assisting  our  local \\nstakeholders in improving the quality and accuracy of the data collected at the local level and \\nhow it is communicated to state and other regional stakeholders is another priority of the \\nboard. \\n \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 10, 2021 \\nPage 18 \\n \\nThe board has thought to increase its visibility in an attempt to better engage local, regional, \\nand  state  stakeholders  and  increase  communication  regarding  current  resources  and \\nchallenges.  The board prioritizes supporting programs that consider the needs of youth, \\nelders, and families in a holistic approach, as issues within family units do not frequently \\nhappen in a vacuum, and addressing the issues throughout the family circuit may have \\nimproved outcomes. \\n \\nLast but not least, the Nevada Department of Veterans Services has made it known to us that \\nour region has a comparatively high percentage of veterans within our population.  The board \\nprioritizes efforts that improve the quality and access to services for those who have served \\nour nation in the armed forces. \\n \\nWhile  many  communities  in  our  region  may  be  geographically  isolated,  they  were  not \\nunaffected  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic  [page  3,  Exhibit  G].    The  information  we  are \\ndiscussing here has been shared in community stakeholder meetings.  It should be cautioned \\nthat many local organizations involved are focusing their limited resources on response, so \\ndata available may not currently reflect these concerns.  Hopefully, they will be able to catch \\nup as pressure from COVID-19 response subsides.  Also, please remember that in such small \\ncommunities,  large  increases  may  constitute  small  numbers  in  comparison  to  urban \\ncommunities.  However, with the already thin behavioral health services available, it does not \\ntake much to overwhelm local resources. \\n \\nEarly on, our local hospitals saw an increase in the number of persons presenting to the \\nemergency departments in crisis.  While some of these community members had presented to \\nthe local hospitals in crisis before, most of them were experiencing mental health crises for \\nthe first time.  This was followed by a sort of second wave of problems where hospitals were \\nseeing  more  patients  who  were  presenting  for  reasons  related  to  increased  alcohol  and \\nsubstance abuse, as well as increased intentional overdoses. \\n \\nOur local stakeholders have reported major concerns regarding increases in depression and \\nanxiety among youth as well as frontline workers in health care, law enforcement, and other \\nemergency health services.  Additionally, increased isolation among community members is \\nleading  to concern,  but  even  more  so  for those  who  are  homebound  or  geographically \\nisolated.   \\n \\nThat is my very brief introduction to the Rural Regional Behavioral Health Policy Board.  \\nThank you for your time and if you have any questions or comments, I can be reached by \\nemail. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nThank you.  I appreciate your brevity.  I know this is a complex subject.  I will now move on \\nto Ms. Dorothy Edwards who is with the Washoe Regional Behavioral Health Policy Board. \\n \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 10, 2021 \\nPage 19 \\n \\nDorothy Edwards, Washoe Regional Behavioral Health Coordinator, Washoe Regional \\nBehavioral Health Policy Board: \\n[Dorothy Edwards presented a PowerPoint Exhibit H and a summary sheet Exhibit I].  I will \\nshare a few of the main priorities, action strategies, and some challenges that the Washoe \\nRegional Behavioral Health Policy Board has identified for support and to expand throughout \\nWashoe County [page 1, Exhibit H].  An analysis of where Washoe County is in terms of \\nreadiness to stand up a crisis stabilization center remains something on which the board is \\nfocused.  In response to the ongoing issue of individuals experiencing behavioral health \\ncrises and often being taken to jail or emergency rooms inappropriately, these facilities are \\nconsidered an emergency health care alternative.  The strategy for success for this state-\\nsupported endeavor began in the 80th Legislative Session with the introduction and passage \\nof Assembly Bill 66 of the 80th Session which addressed some components of this type of \\nfacility.  During this biennium, our strategy for moving forward includes the completion of \\nan assets-and-gaps analysis, a visit to one of the originators of the concept in Arizona, and \\nincreased collaboration with partners in our state, city and county leadership to discuss the \\nnext steps. \\n \\nWhile Washoe remains well-poised in some required elements, challenges to success include \\nfinding sustained funding, infrastructure, and then developing the policies and processes \\nrequired for collaboration between agencies [page 1, Exhibit I].  It does remain a strong \\npriority in our county. \\n \\nA second priority is equitable focus on substance misuse [page 1].  While we know that \\nbehavioral health encompasses mental health and substance misuse, there has been some \\nconcern expressed that the focus of programs, funding, and policy might be inequitable \\nbetween the two.  Understanding that the two are often co-occurring, we need to work to \\nensure that there is inclusion and collaboration with all sectors of behavioral health.   \\n \\nStrategy for success began as we invited presenters from all sides of behavioral health \\nincluding substance misuse treatment, prevention, and recovery, to provide information, \\neducation, and solicitation for a change in legislation through a bill draft.  Several of those \\nwere selected for the board\\'s current bill, Senate Bill 69.   Our work and focus will include \\nsupporting the development of a diverse, culturally appropriate, inclusive, and well-trained \\nworkforce in both areas of mental health.  Behavioral health response before, during, and \\nafter a crisis needs to be talked about [pages 1 and 2].  If we learned anything from this \\npublic  health  crisis,  it  is  that  we  need  a  robust  plan  and  trained  staff  to  focus  on  the \\nsometimes overwhelming behavioral health consequences of an emergent event. \\n \\nOur strategy in Washoe for success included participating in the resilience project.  Another \\nstrategy was the development this year of a draft behavioral health annex to our regional \\nemergency response plan.  We will continue to encourage and reach out to all organizations \\nto take advantage of resources for training, such as in psychological first aid, with the goal of \\ncreating community response teams to activate when needed during an event.  We look \\nforward to conducting drills and exercises with local and state partners when it is safe and \\npractical to do so.   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 10, 2021 \\nPage 20 \\n \\nThe Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) was actually developed by the Washoe \\nCounty Health District [page 2].  It is a plan of action to address local conditions that are \\ncontributing to or causing poor health in Washoe County.  Behavioral health is seen as the \\ntop concern cited by the community, and one that greatly suffers from lack of adequate \\nresources and an available workforce.  It also ties in closely to the housing focus area, as \\nmany  chronically  homeless  individuals  suffer  from  mental  illness  and  substance  use \\ndisorders, and adequate housing is seen as a critical foundation to providing successful \\ntreatment. \\n \\nThe Washoe board committed its support of the behavioral health focus areas within the \\nCHIP, which will include some robust and improved data collection and analysis, support \\nand participation in the Built for Zero homeless initiative which is being implemented by \\nWashoe County.  Challenges include the lack of housing and resources, along with a trained \\nworkforce.   \\n \\nAs  we  have  all  talked  about  today,  the  board  understands  that  accurate  data  around \\nbehavioral health is necessary to inform trends and assist in making decisions.  The annual \\nRegional Profile is nearing completion as is the policy board\\'s annual report.  Both will \\ninclude the most recent behavioral health data available for state and regional comparisons.  \\nA data website, or dashboard, is required for the regions, and Washoe continues to work on it \\nwith a target completion date of this year.  I am happy to provide additional information on \\nany of these subjects or on the reports I addressed, so feel free to reach out to me, and I will \\nget you what you need to know. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nWe will move next to the Clark Regional Behavioral Health Coordinator, Teresa Etcheberry. \\n \\nTeresa Etcheberry, Clark Regional Behavioral Health Coordinator, Clark Regional \\nBehavioral Health Policy Board: \\n[Teresa Etcheberry presented a summary Exhibit J and a PowerPoint Exhibit K].  Clark \\nCounty is one of the largest counties in Nevada.  To give you an overview, per the Office of \\nthe State Demographer and the U.S. Census Bureau, the population in 2019 for Clark County \\nwas 2,255,175 persons.  Clark County holds 73.6 percent of Nevada\\'s population.   \\n \\nWe have a very diverse board.  Board members are well versed in behavioral health issues, \\nand they hold different positions throughout the county on other boards [page 1, Exhibit J].  \\nThey also share the demographics for our county. \\n \\nThe Clark Regional Behavioral Health Policy Board embraces a data-driven approach to \\nidentify  the  behavioral  health  outcomes  and  system  gaps  of  the  region;  therefore,  the \\nsuccess of the approach depends on the existence of data, the types of data, and the quality of \\ndata gathered.  What we are looking for in our data are the gaps and challenges in our area \\n[page 1, Exhibit J].  We need to collect civil commitment data, including details from law \\nenforcement, transports by emergency medical services to hospital emergency rooms, the \\ntreatment in the emergency rooms, and a summary of any transition to psychiatric services.  \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 10, 2021 \\nPage 21 \\n \\nWe also would like to know where people are placed and discharged and the length of stay \\nfor those hospitalized and treated in emergency rooms.  This will guide the board in assessing \\nthe after- and ongoing care, and in developing the different reports we have to produce for \\nour stakeholders and the state. \\n \\nWorkforce development is another concern.  We would like to have an increase in the supply \\nof providers in behavioral health.  The board recognizes that the availability of qualified \\nbehavioral health providers is a concern here in Clark County.  While the region has seen \\nsteady growth, our community still falls below the average of providers per capita.  The \\nboard wants to further investigate what measures it could take to improve the behavioral \\nhealth workforce supply in Clark County. \\n \\nRegarding data management and application, we are working on a data dashboard, but we \\nalso need to have a data management system for Clark County, such as a health information \\nexchange to provide access to behavioral health data and for the ease of use for providers and \\nresidents of Clark County. \\n \\nThe big thing that happened in 2020 is the pandemic crisis.  We have seen an increase in the \\nnumber of people seeking services on a national level as well as in Nevada.  As we heard in \\nprevious  presentations,  we  have  an  increasing  number  of  adults,  youth,  and  children \\nreporting symptoms of anxiety and depression, and we have had an increase in the number of \\nsuicides.  We are also seeing disproportionate impacts on Blacks, indigenous people and \\npeople  of  color,  and  on  other  populations  including  the  elderly,  individuals  with \\ndevelopmental disabilities, residents of rural communities, and people living in poverty. \\n \\nThese concerns and challenges drive the board\\'s priorities [page 3, Exhibit K].  As I spoke \\nabout the priorities for mental health and workforce development, we also want to see \\ndedicated  funding  for  crisis  services.    We  spent  many  weeks  working  on  Crisis  Now, \\ngathering information, talking about a Crisis Now system.  We would like to expand our \\nmobile crisis teams all over the county.  We have a large urban area, but we also have many \\nrural areas that lack crisis teams.  The board also wants to increase community access to \\ncrisis intervention, and we want to increase the stabilization of crisis services for after-care \\nand ongoing services.  The board recognizes the behavioral health issues in our community \\nand we must recognize the abuse of substance misuse and mental health and the use of \\ntelehealth services. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nFinally, we will hear from Ms. Jessica Flood. \\n \\nJessica Flood, Northern Regional Behavioral Health Coordinator, Northern Regional \\nBehavioral Health Policy Board: \\nThis  region  includes  Carson  City,  Lyon,  Douglas,  Churchill,  and  Storey  Counties \\n[Exhibit L].  Here is an overview of the regions, with my region circled [page 2].  These are \\nthe members of the board [page 3].  Our board priorities have remained pretty stable over the \\nlast five years [page 4].  By far, the top priority is obtaining sustainable funding for crisis \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 10, 2021 \\nPage 22 \\n \\nstabilization and jail diversion programs.  We have our mobile outreach safety team (MOST), \\nwhich  is  a  co-responder  team,  our  Forensic  Assessment  Services  Triage  teams  are  jail \\nreentry, and CIT is Crisis Intervention Team training for law enforcement—mental health \\ntraining.  Our Mallory Behavioral Health Crisis Center is run through the Carson Tahoe \\nRegional Medical Center and is our psychiatric emergency room.    \\n \\nOur priorities include increasing the behavioral health workforce with the capability to treat \\nadults and youth, increasing access to treatment in all levels of care, increasing access to \\naffordable and supported housing, and developing services to support continuity of care.  \\nThat is looking at wraparound and community health workers. \\n \\nTo Assemblywoman Titus\\'s point, we have seen some progress in our region, and it is quite \\nexciting.  I spoke about the Mallory Crisis Center [page 5].  That has been really pivotal to \\nhave  that  24/7  access  for  people  in  crisis.    We  are  also  very  lucky  to  have  certified \\ncommunity behavioral health centers (CCBHC), and both Carson Tahoe and the CCBHCs \\nhave assertive community treatment teams which provide this wraparound to people who are \\nin serious mental illness.  Through those programs, along with our mobile outreach safety \\nteams, we are seeing this incredible ability to identify individuals in crisis and get them into \\ntreatment and stabilized in a way we have not seen before.  I was speaking to the MOST \\nofficer in Carson City yesterday, and he was saying there were individuals who had been in \\ncrisis for ten years who are now stable. \\n \\nDr. Woodard mentioned their emphasis on making jail reentry and criminal justice diversion \\nevidence-based.  The state has done a lot of work with us to bring our jail reentry teams up to \\nevidence-based practice, and we are very grateful for that.  So we think we are making \\nprogress in developing this comprehensive mental health system bit by bit.   \\n \\nWhat we think is working in our region is that we have these local behavioral health task \\nforces that provide community input into the northern board [page 6, Exhibit L].  We also \\nhave a culture of collaboration in the northern region with a lot of organizations partnering \\non grants.  Again, I have to give a lot of credit to the state.  We have been able to identify \\ncommunity partners that are willing to expand their treatment services, and the state has been \\nable to obtain some funding for those programs.  Along with that, the state provides quite a \\nbit of technical assistance that has allowed our programs to, hopefully, achieve sustainability \\nin the future. \\n \\nOur gaps and needs mirror our priorities [page 7].  We need access to care for youth and \\nadults, especially youth.  I have received calls from parents who have insurance and, despite \\ntheir  best  efforts,  cannot  find  treatment  for  youth  coming  out  of  inpatient  psychiatric \\nhospitalization.  We need more behavioral health workforce.  It is inhibiting us from creating \\nmore programs and expanding access to care.  We are rich in crisis lines, and we appreciate \\nmany of them, but we have noticed that we still need in-person outreach for people who are \\nin crisis, and that is in both the youth and adult perspectives.   \\n \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 10, 2021 \\nPage 23 \\n \\nIn our region we see a gap for supported housing, including group homes and long-term \\nsupported living arrangements for people with serious mental illness.  As has been touched \\non,  we  see  this  need  for  support  for  COVID-19-induced  risk  factors—isolation, \\nunemployment, grief, and loss—and in particular for seniors.  We are seeing a lot of seniors \\nand older adults who are in crisis and starting to need hospitalization due to the isolation. \\n \\nWe are working on regional behavioral health emergency operations planning.  We are trying \\nto develop a website for the board that shows the data dashboard.  Our region is trying \\nto educate  ourselves  about  what  regional  behavioral  health  authorities  would  look  like, \\nrelated to taking the next step to regionalize mental health through these boards.  With these \\nmulti-county arrangements, we find there is no central way to apply for grants or to bring \\nfunding to the regions.  As a result, there may be a benefit to looking at formalization \\n[page 8, Exhibit L]. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nAt this time, I am not going to take any questions; however, I would encourage Committee \\nmembers to contact our presenters if you have any questions. Prior to my participation last \\nsession on this Committee, I was unaware of all these policy boards that exist in our state.  \\nThey really are a resource about things happening regionally, particularly in your districts, \\nand I highly encourage you to reach out to them.  They are the boots on the ground; they \\nhave a better idea of what is going on locally, and can give you that information, especially if \\nyou are looking at crafting legislation in the future in these areas. \\n \\nWe have two legislative measures being presented this afternoon, and I have allocated equal \\ntime for testimony in support, opposition, and neutral for each bill after its introduction.  \\nEach person providing testimony in support, opposition, or neutral will be given a maximum \\nof two minutes, and staff will be timing them so everyone will have a fair opportunity to \\nspeak.  We will limit the overall testimony to 20 minutes for each measure.  All testimony in \\nsupport, opposition, and neutral will be over the audio lines to ensure fairness to all testifiers.  \\nAnyone joining the meeting on camera is either a Committee member, staff member, bill \\nsponsor, presenter, or staff from agencies to help respond to any questions we may have \\nthroughout this hearing.  At this time, no one will be joining the meeting on camera.  I am \\nopen to changing this policy to make certain we are as open and as transparent as we possibly \\ncan be so as to engage as many members of the public who want to appear in the new format \\nas possible.  I am working with broadcast services as well as with all of you to make sure we \\nare able to do that fairly.   \\n \\nI will now open the hearing on Assembly Bill 62.  This bill revises provisions related to the \\nNevada ABLE (Achieving a Better Life Experience) Savings Program.   Hopefully, you all \\nhad an opportunity to review some of the legislation from the 2019 Session and the links we \\nprovided to you on Monday.  \\n \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 10, 2021 \\nPage 24 \\n \\nAssembly Bill 62:  Revises provisions relating to the Nevada ABLE Savings Program. \\n(BDR 38-397) \\n \\nZach Conine, State Treasurer: \\nI am very excited to be here today to present Assembly Bill 62 which helps to innovate and \\nstrengthen Nevada\\'s ABLE Savings Program to ensure that Nevadans with disabilities have \\nthe opportunity to save for a better future.  Broadly speaking, ABLE accounts are tax-\\nadvantaged savings accounts that allow people with disabilities to earn and save money \\nwithout losing access to vital programs like Medicaid and social security.  By making these \\ntax-free  savings  accounts  available  to  individuals  to  cover  qualified  disability-related \\nexpenses for things like education, housing, and transportation, the program aims to ease the \\nfinancial  burden  faced  by  citizens  with  disabilities  who  are  the  most  underemployed \\ndemographic group in the state. \\n \\nIn the 2019 Legislative Session, our office worked with Assemblywoman Cohen and the \\nDivision of Aging and Disability Services to pass A.B. 130 of the 80th Session which moved \\nthe entire ABLE Savings Program into the Treasurer\\'s Office.  Since that time, our office has \\nworked with hundreds of Nevadans with disabilities and their families to make sure they can \\ngain access to these accounts without any impact or cost to the State\\'s General Fund.  The \\nprovisions of A.B. 62 would make Nevada the first state in the country to find innovative \\nways to incentivize people with disabilities to open these accounts and build up account \\nbalances to build their own great big, beautiful tomorrow.  I will now ask Erik Jimenez from \\nour office to walk through the specifics of the bill. \\n \\nBefore I do that, I would like to mention the tremendous work Erik has done focusing on the \\nABLE Savings Program over the last two years.  His singular effort has helped hundreds of \\nNevada families, and he did that while helping me coordinate the largest recovery effort in \\nthe state\\'s history. \\n \\nErik Jimenez, Senior Deputy Treasurer, Office of the State Treasurer: \\nPassage  of  the  ABLE  Act  of  2014  was  the  single  greatest  move  toward  disability \\nindependence since the Americans with Disabilities Act.  When we took the program over \\nfrom the Aging and Disability Services Division (ADSD) in 2019, there were a little over \\n200 accounts with about $1 million in assets.  We have grown that to more than 1,000 \\naccounts with over $6 million in assets, all using zero dollars from the State\\'s General Fund.  \\nWe do this for free.  It is not in the state\\'s interest to make money on these accounts.  We do \\nit so people with disabilities can save, possibly get out of bad situations, and build a brighter \\nfuture.  Broadly speaking, we have a simple bill in front of you today, and I would be remiss \\nif I did not thank Karly O\\'Krent from the Legislative Counsel Bureau for working with us on \\nthe bill. \\n \\nThis bill modernizes our ABLE accounts to mirror our Nevada College Kickstart program \\nwhich gives $50 to every kindergartener in Nevada to kickstart savings.  When I talk to \\nfamilies about the benefits of ABLE accounts, one of the biggest barriers is earning an \\nincome without losing their Medicaid and/or social security benefits, but they also do not \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 10, 2021 \\nPage 25 \\n \\nhave the startup capital to open a bank account.  We would like to find some innovative ways \\nto pay for seeding and growing these accounts that make them more sustainable for the state \\ngoing forward.  The bill would authorize our office to promulgate regulations that would \\nincentivize the opening of new accounts, similar to how we already do with Nevada College \\nKickstart, and then to incentivize regular deposits from existing account holders.  So, if \\nsomeone has an ABLE account and wants to start contributing, say $100 a month, how can \\nthe state meet that person halfway and start to figure out how to match?  All of this we are \\nproposing to not be funded out of the General Fund.  There would be no tax for this program; \\nit would be done purely through private philanthropy and federal grant funding.  I want to \\nthank some of the groups that have already expressed interest in doing that, particularly the \\nNevada Bankers Association.  It has been a great partner in making sure we get awareness \\nabout these accounts to the public. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nAre there any questions? \\n \\nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \\nWhat is considered to be a qualifying disability? \\n \\nErik Jimenez: \\nA qualified disability expense is any expense that is incurred as a result of living with a \\ndisability.  It is intended to improve someone\\'s quality of life.  When the bill was passed and \\nsigned, the idea was to make the categories as flexible as possible so as to encourage people \\nto save but also allow them to use these expenses for pretty much anything the individual \\nwould encounter.  Those vary from education, health and wellness, housing, transportation, \\nlegal  and  professional  fees,  financial  management,  employment  training  and  support, \\nassistive technology, and personal support services.   \\n \\nI get asked that question a lot when I talk to families.  They ask things such as whether they \\ncould open an ABLE account and use that money to take a trip to Disneyland.  We are trying \\nto make the argument that, if it improves that individual\\'s quality of life, better mental health, \\nI could make an argument that it would be an eligible expense.  The goal is to make it as \\nbroad as possible so these folks can spend this money just as anyone else would with their \\ncheckbook. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \\nWho qualifies?  What disabilities would qualify? \\n \\nErik Jimenez: \\nThere is guidance from the Social Security Administration\\'s \"blue book,\" but people with \\nsignificant disabilities that occur prior to the age of 26 are eligible for an ABLE account.  In \\nterms of disabilities, any intellectual development disabilities, autism, Down\\'s syndrome, and \\nthose sorts of things would qualify.  We work with the Nevada Justice Association on \\nmaking sure that people with mental health disorders also can qualify for these accounts, but \\nmost disabilities are covered under the ABLE Act. \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 10, 2021 \\nPage 26 \\n \\nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \\nThank you for all the work you have done on the ABLE Program.  I have a question about \\nsection  1,  subsection  4,  paragraph  (a),  subparagraph  (3),  \"Methods  and  incentives  to \\nencourage contributions to a savings trust account.\"  Could you tell us more about what we \\nmight expect to see when talking about \"incentives\"? \\n \\nErik Jimenez: \\nWe wanted to be very deliberate insofar as we do not know how much money we will be able \\nto bring in either from federal grants or from private dollars.  We did not want to commit in \\nstatute to a particular dollar figure if we could not meet that dollar figure.  Assuming this bill \\nworks its way through the process, we can secure some funding and then outline what that \\nminimum threshold would be.  At this point, we are looking at between $50 to $100, and we \\nwould  define  that  clearly  through  regulations  that  would  go  through  the  Legislative \\nCommission.  But at this point, we are giving ourselves flexibility if that dollar number \\nmoves around a little bit. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \\nMy assumption is that this would be a cash incentive for opening an account—perhaps like \\nthe College Kickstart Program.  Is that what I should view as a frame of reference? \\n \\nErik Jimenez: \\nI think that is exactly right.  We are continually working through this process, and I want to \\nmake sure that we clarify in the regulations that our ABLE account program is open to \\nanyone in the country.  It would be important to clarify this for the record that Nevada \\nparticipants in this program would be eligible for the incentives.  While I appreciate people \\nfrom other states participating in our program, our goal here is trying to help as many \\nNevadans as we can. \\n \\nZach Conine: \\nThat would match some of the work we do on the college savings front, where there are \\nmatching programs available for individuals living in Nevada, even though the programs are \\nbroadly available for everyone. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nAre there any other questions?  [There was no reply.]  I have one comment.  When we spoke \\nabout this bill, you mentioned that this has not been enacted anywhere else, so this would be \\na unique, innovative program.  Other people around the country would be looking at Nevada \\nas a model in this area.  Can you speak to that? \\n \\nErik Jimenez: \\nThat is why we wanted to bring this bill forward—to make it abundantly clear that the \\nlegislative intent is to move forward with a program like this.  We would be the first program \\nin the country to do something like this.  We are part of an alliance of states that administer \\nABLE accounts, and I talk to most of them on a monthly basis.  The states of California and \\nOregon are anxiously watching this bill to see if we are successful, because they would love \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 10, 2021 \\nPage 27 \\n \\nto replicate that success.  Additionally, we have been in conversation with the United States \\nSenate Special Committee on Aging and its chairman, who is from Pennsylvania.  They are \\nalso watching us to see if this is successful.  If it is, they could replicate this on the federal \\nlevel and do some sort of block grant into ABLE accounts to make sure we incentivize that \\ngrowth. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \\nI  see  here  that  you  are  going  to  develop  the  methods  and  incentives  to  encourage \\ncontributions to the savings trust account but that there is also going to be an endowment \\npiece.  I imagine that once you are successful—which we know you will be—in getting \\ngrants into that main endowment, can you explain what that procedure will look like, in \\nterms of distribution to those individual accounts?  Will it be a penny-for-penny distribution?  \\nWill there be an administrative set-aside out of the endowment? \\n \\nErik Jimenez: \\nConceptually, we want to figure out a way that we could find a dollar figure that works for \\neither the initial contribution or the matching contribution.  Not using General Fund dollars, \\nit could be really hard to do an exact penny-for-penny match.  We have some logistical \\nthings to work out on our end since we would be the first state in the country.  Mechanically, \\nwe want to streamline this so it is a little more effective than our College Kickstart program.  \\nAs you are aware, Nevada College Kickstart is a separate ledger account.  The intention here \\nwould be to make that contribution go directly into the ABLE account, so there are not two \\nseparate accounts which would create more friction in the savings.  The seed money would \\nbe earning interest, and then would be able to be used and saved by the individual. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Titus: \\nCould the individuals contribute to the savings accounts themselves?  We heard testimony \\nfrom folks who had a small business selling popcorn that it would be counted against them \\nwhen it comes to support for some of the social services they needed.  Would they put that \\nmoney into this account? \\n \\nErik Jimenez: \\nThat is 100 percent accurate.  Individuals with these accounts can save up to $15,000 a year \\nwithout  losing  access  to  means-tested  benefits—food  assistance  programs,  Medicaid, \\nSupplemental Security Income (SSI), and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI).  If one \\nis  working,  for  instance,  Jack  with  the  popcorn  company,  Jack  can  save  an  additional \\n$12,000 into his account.  The real benefit is getting people with disabilities to start saving, \\nbut also to start working so they can live independently.  Twenty-seven thousand dollars a \\nyear is really beneficial, and can get someone out of poverty.   \\n \\nAssemblywoman Titus: \\nThat is the thing I was most impressed by with this program, and why I am so supportive of \\nit.  It is really enabling them to get a business going, and while doing that, not fearing they \\nwould be kicked off the welfare system or their health care—things they need so desperately.  \\nThank you for that clarification and thank you for bringing this forward.      \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 10, 2021 \\nPage 28 \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nAre there any other questions?  I do not see any more, so at this time, we will hear testimony \\nin support, opposition, and neutral.  Again, to provide testimony, you have to register online \\nat  the  legislative  website.    Registrants  will  receive  a  phone  number,  meeting  ID,  and \\ninstructions on how to join the meeting.  Remember to clearly state your name and spell it for \\nthe record and limit your testimony to two minutes.  Again, staff will be timing each speaker \\nto make sure we are giving everyone a fair and equal opportunity to speak, and we will limit \\nthis to 20 minutes. \\n \\nDora Uchel-Martinez, Private Citizen, Reno, Nevada: \\nI am totally blind, and I absolutely support this bill.   Thank you to Erik Jimenez and Zach \\nConine; you are awesome, as is Assemblywoman Cohen. \\n \\nConnor Cain, Vice President, Nevada Bankers Association: \\nI am testifying on behalf of the Nevada Bankers Association in support of A.B. 62.  The \\nNevada Bankers Association knows the importance of saving and has supported a number of \\nbanking and savings opportunities for Nevadans.  We are excited to support Nevada\\'s ABLE \\nSavings Program as it makes sure that a person living with a disability is not penalized \\nbecause that person is saving money.  We think the proposed changes outlined in A.B. 62 \\nprovide even greater assistance for some of these savings accounts.  We are very proud of \\nState Treasurer Conine and Mr. Jimenez for being leaders in this, not only in our state but, as \\nyou heard, influencing policy around the country.  We would also like to recognize the fact \\nthat these men have worked tirelessly throughout this pandemic to help countless Nevadans.  \\nThey have been answering phone calls and emails late at night, working on the weekends and \\nholidays, and they are still able to bring forward and tackle policy changes such as the one \\nbefore you today.  We very much appreciate them and everything they do for Nevada and are \\ngrateful for this opportunity to testify.  We encourage your support of A.B. 62. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nDo we have any other people in support?  [There were no others in support.]  Is there anyone \\nonline for opposition testimony?  [There were no callers in opposition.]  Are there any callers \\nin the queue for neutral?  [There were no callers in neutral.]  Do you have any closing \\nremarks? \\n \\nZach Conine: \\nIn the interest of time, we will waive them. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nI will close the hearing on A.B. 62 and open the hearing on Assembly Joint Resolution 1.  \\nThis resolution amends the Nevada Constitution, and Assemblywoman Titus will introduce \\nthe measure. \\n \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 10, 2021 \\nPage 29 \\n \\nAssembly Joint Resolution 1:  Proposes to amend the Nevada Constitution to revise \\nterms relating to persons with certain conditions for whose benefit certain public \\ninstitutions are supported by the State. (BDR C-477) \\n \\nAssemblywoman Robin Titus, Assembly District No. 38: \\nI  am  introducing  Assembly  Joint  Resolution  1,  which  proposes  to  amend  the  Nevada \\nConstitution [Exhibit M].  This resolution is straightforward:  it changes four words in the \\nNevada Constitution.  Some may wonder why we need to change the Constitution to address \\nfour words.  Well, let me tell you what these four words are:  insane, blind, deaf, and dumb.  \\nThese words are found in Section 1, Article 13 of our Constitution.  This section requires the \\nstate to care for certain populations with disabilities or who suffer from a mental illness. The \\nwhole section reads like this: \\n \\nSection 1.  Institutions for Insane, Blind, Deaf and Dumb to be fostered and \\nsupported by state.  Institutions for the benefit of the Insane, Blind and Deaf \\nand Dumb, and such other benevolent institutions as the public good may \\nrequire,  shall  be  fostered  and  supported  by  the  State,  subject  to  such \\nregulations as may be prescribed by law. \\n \\nI am aware that when the Nevada Constitution was written, different terminologies were used \\nto describe persons with disabilities or a mental illness.  However, more than 156 years after \\nNevada was admitted into the Union, it is time to give these words a more critical look.  We \\nshould change them to contemporary language that is not deemed to be discriminatory or \\nnarrow.  I propose we revise this terminology in the following manner: \\n \\n1.  from \"the insane\" to \"persons with a significant mental illness\"; \\n2.  from \"the blind\" to \"persons who are blind or visually impaired\"; and \\n3.  from \"the deaf and dumb\" to \"persons who are deaf or hard of hearing.\" \\n \\nThe idea to change this language in our Constitution came from one of my constituents, \\nMr. Andrew Campbell, who will be joining me later for this bill introduction.  He works in \\nthe Churchill County Middle School as a special education teacher.  Most of his students \\nhave severe to profound disabilities.  Mr. Campbell also teaches American Sign Language in \\nan after-school program, and he is very much aware of the needs of persons who are deaf or \\nhard of hearing.  He describes them as smart and dedicated people in our society who work in \\nbanks, are teachers or engineers.  His own grandfather belonged to this population and was \\none  of  Boeing\\'s  first  hundred  employees  who  designed  an  aircraft.    I  am  grateful  to \\nMr. Campbell who brought this issue to my attention. \\n \\nLet me explain more about the details of my proposed amendment.  First, I want the new \\nterms to start with \"persons.\"  We must stop categorizing people who suffer from an illness \\nor disability by putting an emphasis on their illness or disability, for example, \"the blind\" or \\n\"the deaf.\"  Instead, these are all individuals who happen to have an illness or disability, but \\nfirst and foremost, they are \"persons.\" \\n \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 10, 2021 \\nPage 30 \\n \\nSecond, calling persons who have a hearing loss \"dumb\" in our own Constitution is plainly \\noffensive.  This term must go.  Additionally, many people in our society are not completely \\ndeaf but may suffer from different degrees of hearing loss.  The definition in the Constitution \\nis too narrow, and, therefore, I think it should say \"persons who are deaf or hard of hearing.\" \\n \\n\"Insane\" is another one of those derogatory terms I recommend replacing.  We know that \\nwords matter, and when you stigmatize individuals with such a term, it may lead to negative \\nresults in the long run.  Research has shown that stigmatizing persons with a significant \\nmental illness may create barriers for them.  They may face discrimination and prejudice \\nwhen renting homes, applying for jobs, or accessing mental health services.  Stigmatized \\npeople also are less likely to seek the help they need to treat their condition, which might \\nmake their condition worse.  Using the term \"insane\" in our Constitution for people who \\nsuffer from a mental illness helps to perpetuate this stigma.  Therefore, it should be replaced \\nwith the more dignified term \"persons with a significant mental illness.\" \\n \\n\"Blind\" is not necessarily a discriminatory term, but I think it is too narrow.  If a person is \\nblind, he or she may suffer a complete or nearly complete vision loss; however, this term \\ndoes not include any of the people who have a visual impairment that causes difficulties with \\nnormal daily activities, and which cannot be fixed by simply wearing glasses or contact \\nlenses.  Persons with visual impairments may not be able to walk or read without adaptive \\ntraining or the use of assistive technology.  Contemporary training and assistive technology \\nprograms are for all people who have some kind of visual impairment.  Therefore, this \\nlanguage should be updated as well, and I propose the term \"persons who are blind or \\nvisually impaired.\" \\n \\nIn closing, I believe we must do a better job in making sure that we do not discriminate and \\nstigmatize persons with disabilities or mental illnesses in our laws.  A first step is to ensure \\nno discriminating, stigmatizing, or derogatory language is in our Nevada Constitution, and \\nA.J.R. 1 will provide for that. \\n \\nPlease keep in mind, this resolution is just a first step.  It will not apply to the Nevada \\nRevised Statutes (NRS).  For example, if you do a simple search in our law library on the \\nlegislative website, you can find 67 hits with the term \"insane.\"  I hope there will be another \\nopportunity soon to clean up our statutes as well.  I urge you to support A.J.R. 1 to end the \\nstigmatization of our citizens in the Nevada Constitution. \\n \\nI might add that there has been a friendly amendment suggested; hopefully, the members \\nof this Committee have a copy.  If not, I will read it, and we will make sure everyone gets \\na copy.    This  amendment  came  from  Dena  Schmidt,  Administrator  of  the  Aging  and \\nDisability Services Division in the Department of Health and Human Services [Exhibit N].  \\nShe recommended, and I agree with her, that the new section 1 would read, \\n \\nInstitutions for the benefit of persons with a significant mental illness, persons \\nwho  are  blind  or  visually  impaired,  persons  who  are  deaf  and  hard  of \\nhearing,—and this is the friendly amendment, so it is not in the bill you \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 10, 2021 \\nPage 31 \\n \\nreceived—\"or persons who have an intellectual or developmental disability,\" \\nand such other benevolent institutions as the public good may require. \\n \\nI also might add that a number of members of this body in both the Senate and the Assembly \\nhave asked to be joint sponsors with me.  If anyone else wants to sponsor this bill, I would \\nwelcome everyone\\'s name on this bill as cosponsors.  This was a prefiled bill, so I put it in on \\nmy own, but I think this is something we all should embrace.  I will turn this over to \\nMr. Campbell to make some remarks. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nI believe that friendly amendment has been uploaded onto the Nevada Electronic Legislative \\nInformation System so you all will be able to see it.  If this bill goes forward to a work \\nsession it will be amended, so you may reach out to Assemblywoman Titus if you would like \\nto be added on as a sponsor. \\n \\nAndrew Campbell, Private Citizen, Yerington, Nevada: \\nThanks to Assemblywoman Titus for initiating this process.  It is one that is close to my \\nheart.  I am here testifying today as a citizen of the state of Nevada and resident of Churchill \\nCounty.  I have total deafness in one ear, and I have had total temporary blindness.  I know \\nwhat it is like to live with that, and it is a challenge.  The fact that you are all attentive to this \\nmatter, not only for myself, but for so many members of our community and families, is \\nmuch appreciated as this goes forward. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nAre there questions or comments?   \\n \\nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \\nI love the bill, its language, and its intent.  I was diagnosed with a hearing loss at age 30 and \\ntold I would be deaf within 20 years.  That continues to progress, and I definitely do not want \\nthese adjectives applied to me.   \\n \\nI am wondering about the conforming language where you talk about a change in statute.  \\nThis is a change to the Constitution, and it will take some time.  If we have a successful \\nconstitutional change, is that when we would look at the NRS for the conforming language to \\nmake sure the statutes line up?  Would we need a proactive bill draft request or, once there is \\na constitutional change, does it roll out on the back end? \\n \\nAssemblywoman Titus: \\nI would like to turn this over to our legal counsel to answer that question.  That is also why I \\nam open to the process of getting the wording correct, because the wording has to be \\nmatched next session, and the resolution needs to be passed again.  Then it has to go to a vote \\nof the people to change our Constitution.  That is why it is so critical that we get it as right as \\nwe can. \\n \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 10, 2021 \\nPage 32 \\n \\nI know the wording regarding \"insane\" has been changed in prior legislative sessions, and we \\nhave changed definitions, but we have never gone through the entire NRS and retrospectively \\nchanged all that wording.  That would take a different bill, I believe. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nMs. O\\'Krent, could you answer these concerns? \\n \\nKarly O\\'Krent, Legal Counsel, Legislative Counsel Bureau: \\nTypically, when there are issues like this in a bill, we would include something that would \\nauthorize us to make the additional changes in the NRS when we are codifying things.  \\nBecause this is a bill that does make a change to the Constitution and will have to be passed \\nby another Legislature and then voted on, at the time it has been voted on, we would need to \\nmake the changes pursuant to a separate bill that would then make the proper changes in \\nNRS. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nAre there any other questions or comments?  I see in the chat that Assemblyman Hafen and \\nAssemblywoman Gorelow would like to be considered as cosponsors as you are going \\nthrough the potential amendment process.  I would like to be included as well.  As I said, \\nI would encourage all Committee members, if you are interested, to please reach out to \\nAssemblywoman Titus if you want to be included. \\n \\nAre there any additional comments or questions?  [There was no reply.]  With that, we will \\nhear testimony in support, opposition, or neutral on A.J.R. 1.  We will begin with testimony \\nin support. \\n \\nSteven Cohen, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \\nI would like to say \"ditto\" to the bill\\'s sponsor and to the copresenter\\'s remarks.  I have one \\nother friendly amendment, but I will address it offline.   \\n \\nLiz Davenport, Legal Legislative Extern, American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada: \\nAs this bill removes derogatory and offensive language and provides modernization to the \\nNevada Constitution, we support A.J.R. 1.  Legal terms must be updated so that they foster \\nrespect for people.  Much too often, derogatory terms have fostered incorrect, negative social \\nstigmas.    The  American  Psychological  Association\\'s  Committee  on  Disability  Issues  in \\nPsychology has emphasized the need to avoid offensive expressions and recommends placing \\npeople  first,  just  as  Assemblywoman  Titus  explained.    Further,  when  derogatory  terms \\nremain in statutes and constitutions, judges, lawyers, social workers, institutions, and others \\nare  then,  unfortunately,  compelled  to  apply  these  pejorative  terms  when  applying  the \\nconstitution.  The United States Congress recognized this over ten years ago, and in 2010 and \\n2012, removed similar derogatory terms such as mental retardation and lunatic from the \\nUnited States Code.  Similarly, as this bill removes derogatory and offensive terms from the \\nNevada Constitution, we support A.J.R. 1. \\n \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 10, 2021 \\nPage 33 \\n \\nJohn Piro, representing Clark County Public Defender\\'s Office and Washoe County \\nPublic Defender\\'s Office: \\nAs lawyers, we understand that language is important, and the language Assemblywoman \\nTitus is seeking to change in this bill is stigmatizing and detrimental to people in our state.  \\nWe thank Assemblywoman Titus for bringing this legislation forward, and we echo the \\nstatements of the previous speaker.  We support this bill. \\n \\nBeth Jones, Private Citizen, Henderson, Nevada: \\nI also have two callers on the line who registered to give testimony here today.  I will first \\nintroduce my son, Harrison Jones. \\n \\nHarrison Jones, Private Citizen, Henderson, Nevada: \\nGood afternoon.  I am nine years old.  I am hard of hearing, and I am representing myself in \\nsupport of A.J.R. 1.  I do not think people called deaf or hard of hearing should be called deaf \\nand dumb because it makes me feel like I am stupid.  I am on the advanced placement honor \\nroll at Gordon McCaw STEAM Academy.  I am a blue belt in karate, and an actor in the deaf \\nand hard of hearing theater program.  I am the opposite of dumb; I am smart.  If you are deaf, \\nyou can do anything anybody else can do but hear.  Being deaf does not make you dumb.  \\nThank you and have a good afternoon. \\n \\nAlexis Jones, Private Citizen, Henderson, Nevada: \\nI am thirteen years old.  I am representing myself in support of A.J.R. 1.  I have severe and \\nprofound hearing loss in both ears and wear hearing aids.  The terms deaf and dumb should \\nnot be applied to deaf and hard of hearing people because we are like everyone else.  I have \\nbeen in National Junior Honor Society for two years; I have gotten straight A\\'s in all my \\nhonors classes for all my years in middle school so far.  In elementary school, I won gold \\nmedals in the science Olympiad; I was a tour guide for McCaw School of Mines and \\ncontinually on the honor roll.  I testified for a different bill two years ago when I was eleven \\nregarding deaf and hard of hearing kids.  I sat with Assemblywoman Titus two years ago \\nwhen my family attended children\\'s day at the Legislature.  I was in Girl Scouts for five years \\nin the media/PR team and I served my community.  On top of that, I have been playing \\nsoccer for over ten years.  When I am older, my goal is to be on the U.S.A. Women\\'s \\nNational Deaf Soccer Team.  I am an avid reader and can read over a thousand words per \\nminute.  I have also been a part of the theater group for deaf and hard of hearing children for \\nover six years.  I applied to a magnet high school and will be finding out if I was accepted \\nnext month.  I can do many, if not all, things hearing children can do, so the term \"deaf and \\ndumb\" is not applicable in this situation anymore.  It is not right to call deaf and hard of \\nhearing people that term in the first place.  I am proud to be hard of hearing and in the deaf \\ncommunity and to be here testifying to update disability-friendly language. \\n \\nWhile being hard of hearing has its setbacks, it has lots of advantages too.  If I had a choice \\nto have normal hearing, I would not take it.  Having hearing loss is what made me the person \\nI am today, and I would not change that for the world.  Thank you to Assemblywoman Titus \\nfor sponsoring this amendment and for allowing me an opportunity to speak, and have a great \\nafternoon. \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 10, 2021 \\nPage 34 \\n \\nJennifer Richards, Chief Elder and Disability Rights Attorney, Aging and Disability \\nServices Division, Department of Health and Human Services: \\nOur  agency  supports  A.J.R.  1,  and  we  are  thankful  to  Assemblywoman  Titus  and  this \\nCommittee for shining a spotlight on this issue.  The language we use matters.  The terms \\ncurrently in our state Constitution are pejorative, they are offensive, and they are a reminder \\nof a very dark chapter in our state and nation\\'s history for persons with these disabilities.  It \\nwas a time of compulsory sterilization laws, discrimination, lack of accessibility, and other \\natrocities.  The United States Supreme Court upheld compulsory sterilization laws for those \\nwith intellectual disabilities in Buck v. Bell, 274 U.S. 200 (1927).  The Court held that \\npersons with disabilities do not have a fundamental right to make private decisions regarding \\ntheir family lives.  In delivering the decision, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., declared \\nthat \"three generations of imbeciles are enough.\"  The use of this term emboldened other \\nstates  to  adopt  compulsory  laws,  and  it  perpetuated  further  marginalization  and \\ndiscrimination of persons living with disabilities for decades.  Since that time, passage of the \\nUnited Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Americans with \\nDisabilities Act (ADA), and other important legislation has helped usher in a paradigm shift \\nfrom viewing persons with disabilities as objects of charity, medical treatment, or social \\nprotection to full and equal members of society with fundamental human rights. \\n \\nAll of us at ADSD, and DHHS as a whole, care about the people we serve in our state and we \\nstrive to use appropriate, person-centered language when providing those services.  Again, \\nwe are very thankful to the Assemblywoman and to the Committee for addressing this issue. \\n \\nJamie Stetson, Private Citizen, Reno, Nevada: \\nAcross the board I work for people who have different kinds of disabilities and I also have \\nchildren who are on the autism spectrum.  This bill, in changing the language throughout our \\nNRS, is so important to legitimizing and taking away the stigma for people with disabilities \\nin our communities.  We have a significant lack of providers, a significant lack of ability to \\naccess resources in our community, and having this kind of language remaining in our NRS, \\nand this kind of language still being used in our state, is shameful and something that needs \\nto be taken care of.  I am really grateful to see that something is being done about it.  \\nI strongly support this bill and any other bill changing the disgusting language that has been \\nused and that also supports people and creates fewer barriers to access and shows our \\ncommunity members that we support them.  I appreciate the time you have taken to get this \\nput forward. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nAre there other callers in support?  [There were none.]  Are there any callers in opposition?  \\n[There were none.]  Are there callers who want to testify in neutral?  [There were none.]  \\n \\nAre there any closing remarks, Assemblywoman Titus or Mr. Campbell? \\n \\nAssemblywoman Titus: \\nI would like to thank you all for hearing this bill.  I appreciate it and, as you could hear from \\nthe testimony, it is very important.  To all Committee members who have reached out, I will \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 10, 2021 \\nPage 35 \\n \\nadd your names, and when we hear this bill again, hopefully in a work session, we will add \\nthose amendments.  I want to get this right, so if there are other suggestions, I am open to \\nthem.  As you heard, we need to fix this, so thank you for all your time.      \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nThank you so much for your presentation.  I would encourage Committee members to reach \\nout to Assemblywoman Titus as she is working through this and preparing it for any work \\nsession.  Anytime we have constitutional changes, we want to get them right.  With that, \\nI will close the hearing on A.J.R. 1.  \\n \\n[Exhibit O was submitted but not discussed and will become part of the record.] \\n \\n Do we have any people on the line for public comment?   \\n \\nNicole Willis-Grimes, representing Special Olympics of Nevada: \\nI apologize, I was not quick enough to dial in to support Assembly Bill 62.  I recognize that \\nyou would prefer for public comment to focus on issues other than the bill, but I appreciate \\nthe opportunity to quickly voice our support on behalf of Special Olympics of Nevada.  \\nSpecial Olympics of Nevada is dedicated to enriching lives of children and adults with \\nintellectual  disabilities  during  inclusive  sports,  education,  and  health.    We  very  much \\nappreciate the State Treasurer and Mr. Jimenez\\'s efforts on inclusive policy—especially \\nfinancial inclusivity and providing a kickstart possibility for the ABLE accounts. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nWe are trying to be as flexible as possible and sometimes it is more difficult in this virtual \\nand telephonic world, so that is fine.  \\n \\nAre there any comments from Committee members before we adjourn? \\n \\nDora Uchel-Martinez, Private Citizen: \\nI was going to speak before, but I was not fast enough.  I really appreciate Assemblywoman \\nTitus and Andrew Campbell for bringing A.J.R. 1 forward.  After 30 years of the ADA \\npassing, I am glad we are on the right path.  Thank you for your time and for recognizing that \\npeople with disabilities are people first.  We all have different abilities, and people with \\ndisabilities are resilient; you might learn something from us. \\n \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 10, 2021 \\nPage 36 \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nIs there anyone else on the line?

Also, please turn your camera on and leave it on during the entire \\ncommittee hearing.  Today, we have two overviews on Nevada\\'s Children\\'s Mental Health \\nConsortia as well as an overview of Medicaid.  We also have one bill hearing.  We are asking \\nthat all public comment be kept to two minutes, so everyone interested in speaking can be \\naccommodated  and  we  can  ensure  we  get  through  this  agenda  in  a  timely  fashion.  \\nAdditionally, we will limit the overall length of each public comment period to twenty \\nminutes.  Speakers are urged to avoid repetition of comments and may submit any additional \\ncomments in writing within 48 hours of the meeting adjournment.  You may see Committee \\nmembers looking at multiple screens or electronic devices.  Please note that they are not \\ntrying to be disrespectful.  We are all working in this virtual setting trying to refer to \\npresentations or other written documents that we might have on various devices.   \\n \\nWe will now move on to our first agenda item. \\n \\nMegan Freeman, Clinical and Policy Advisor on Children\\'s Behavioral Health, Division \\nof Child and Family Services, Department of Health and Human Services:  \\nThank you for this opportunity to follow up on our presentation concerning children\\'s mental \\nhealth.  Today, we are going to describe our children\\'s mental health consortia in Nevada and \\nhow they shape our children\\'s mental health system [Exhibit C].  I am going to provide a \\nbrief overview of how the consortia were established and how they function, then the chair of \\neach consortium is going to take five minutes to describe its regional priorities and the recent \\nimpacts of the pandemic on its region. \\n \\nHere [page 3] is a brief reminder of our agency vision and mission which we talked about in \\ndetail last week.  As you know, Nevada has a bifurcated child welfare system.  This means \\nthat in the urban counties, the county provides child welfare services, whereas in the rest of \\nNevada, the Division of Child and Family Services (DCFS) is responsible for child welfare \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 15, 2021 \\nPage 3 \\n \\nservices.  This structure was established by Assembly Bill 1 of the 17th Special Session \\nin response to concerns about the previous structure of the child welfare system causing \\ninterruptions  and  delays  in  services  and  placements,  as  well  as  delays  in  permanency \\nplanning which would cause the child to remain in the child welfare system for longer \\nthan  necessary, among other concerns.  When this bifurcated system was established, the bill \\nalso required the establishment of independent groups that would assess and plan for the \\nmental health needs of children in Nevada.  These groups are the regional children\\'s mental \\nhealth consortia established for Clark and Washoe Counties and for rural Nevada [page 4, \\nExhibit C]. \\n \\nThe consortia operate under system of core values and principles which we reviewed on \\nWednesday last week.  They are family-driven and youth-guided, community-based, and \\nculturally  and  linguistically  appropriate.    In  2010  and  again  in  2020,  each  consortium \\nconducted a needs assessment in its region and submitted a ten-year strategic plan outlining \\nthe priorities for its region and the strategies that would be used to achieve its goals.  Status \\nupdates are provided to the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services \\n(DHHS) and to the Commission on Behavioral Health in odd-numbered years.  In preparing \\nthe biennial budget request for the DHHS, the Director is required to consider the consortia\\'s \\npriorities and any request for budget allocations.  The Director must report to the consortia \\nwhich items from their priority list were included in the Department\\'s request and explain the \\nreasoning for any items that were not. \\n \\nOne of the features of a system of care approach is that youth and families are involved in \\nevery level of governance [page 5].  This includes the children\\'s mental health consortia as \\nthe entities that drive the structure of our children\\'s mental health system.  Each consortium \\nhas a parent of a youth with behavioral health needs as a voting member, and typically, there \\nare several more parents and caregivers in attendance at every meeting.  There is time set \\naside  at  each  meeting  to  hear  parent  concerns.    In  addition  to  individuals  with  much \\nexperience, each consortium consists of a representative from DCFS or from the Division of \\nPublic and Behavioral Health, depending on the region, Nevada Medicaid, the region\\'s child \\nwelfare agency, the board of trustees of the school district, the local juvenile probation \\ndepartment, the local business community, a provider of mental health care, a provider of \\nfoster care, and a provider of substance use treatment.  Each consortium holds a monthly \\npublic meeting, and some of the consortia have focus work groups that also meet monthly.  \\nNow I will turn it over to the Washoe County consortium to go over that region\\'s priorities. \\n \\nJacquelyn Kleinedler, Chair, Washoe County Children\\'s Mental Health Consortium: \\nIn March 2020, the consortium finalized its current ten-year strategic plan as required by the \\nNevada Revised Statutes [Exhibit D].  We identified three overarching goals to guide our \\nconversation, activities, advocacy, and our local and statewide data review strategies [page 6, \\nExhibit C].   In our effort to begin the path toward realization of our shared vision of \\nequitable and compassionate mental health care for all, we established our first goal to \\naddress multiple ongoing and projected community needs in the coming years.  We have \\nstarted conversations around what increased access, decreased barriers, and least restrictive \\nenvironments look like, and what it would take to make resources with these characteristics \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 15, 2021 \\nPage 4 \\n \\navailable to youth.  Achievement of this goal requires expansion of interrelated systems from \\nprivate and public service agencies.  For example, for our school district to succeed in its \\nefforts  to  colocate  services  in  their  schools  and  increase  collaboration  with  community \\npartners, multiple local and state stakeholders must work together to provide the necessary \\nresources to meet agreed-upon objectives. \\n \\nAs our discussion of goals took shape, we realized that primary, preventive support of \\nfamilies and caregivers in their naturally occurring and overlapping systems is necessary.  \\nThus, our second goal is centered around activities that educate community stakeholders, \\nincluding parents, about toxic stress, and about ways to buffer children, build resilience, and \\nstrengthen protective factors.  The foundation of the second goal lies in the compelling \\nresearch  on  adverse  childhood  experiences  that  documents  future  potential  impacts  of \\nunmitigated  toxic  stress  on  children  when  they  become  adults  and,  potentially,  parents \\nthemselves. \\n \\nOur third goal embodies our shared value that children thrive when their family is thriving, \\nand families thrive when their community is thriving.  With this goal, we will set out to \\nbridge systems and identify key community factors that enhance physical and emotional \\nhealth, safety, and well-being.  Each priority on this slide [page 7, Exhibit C] brings us a step \\ncloser to achieving all three long-term goals.   \\n \\nThe challenges and opportunities of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to dominate our \\nmeetings, considerations, and discussions.  We intentionally make space to hear the stories of \\nmembers of our community and look for ways to amplify their voices in local and statewide \\nadvocacy.  Through this process, we have come to understand that teachers and educators, \\nsome of the key adults who we rely upon to guide and teach our children, are themselves \\noverwhelmed with the stressors and demands of educating during the pandemic.  Many are \\nexperiencing what can be characterized as toxic stress.  Thus, our attention has turned to \\nadvocacy for our educators.  In late January, we penned a letter to the Superintendent of \\nPublic  Instruction  and  the  Director  of  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services, \\nrequesting various forms of support, waiver, and relief.  We believe that the adults who wrap \\nlove and support around our youth must also be supported.   \\n \\nAlongside this effort, we continue to examine ways to shore up care of children to address \\nincreased reports of anxiety and depression in our youth and to continue to fight against our \\never-existing youth suicide epidemic.  Though the pandemic has highlighted and intensified \\nexisting disparities in Washoe County around food, housing, and employment insecurity, it \\nhas  also  allowed  a  particularly  unique  opportunity  for  adults  and  young  people  in  our \\ncommunity  to  understand  the  importance  of  mental  health,  and  through  their  shared \\nexperiences, to decrease the stigma around accessing mental health care. \\n \\nWe hope to press on this momentum and keep the attention paid to mental health at the \\nforefront.  We hope to continue to normalize mental health needs and access to mental health \\ncare as a necessary function of overall well-being.  In conclusion, I respectfully ask this \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 15, 2021 \\nPage 5 \\n \\nCommittee to keep our children and families in mind as you continue to proceed through the \\n81st Session. \\n \\nPamela Johnson, Chair, Rural Children\\'s Mental Health Consortium: \\n[Pamela Johnson supplied additional information not discussed Exhibit E].  I am the parent \\nof a child with a serious emotional disturbance.  He received treatment for approximately six \\nyears  that  was  very  expensive  and  confusing.    As  a  nurse,  I  wanted  to  help  others \\nexperiencing the same difficulty, so I decided to volunteer with the rural consortium.  In the \\nlast two years, the consortium has had the highest meeting participation.  We offered a virtual \\nplatform before the pandemic and we have representation from across rural Nevada.   \\n \\nThe rural consortium has five goals I will briefly discuss [page 8, Exhibit C].  The most \\nsuccessful effort we have made is what we refer to as community discussions.  Before the \\npandemic,  we  held  two  events,  one  in  Winnemucca  and  one  in  Tonopah.    We  asked \\ncommunity participants about mental health efforts in their communities.  They addressed \\ntheir successes and challenges.  Our goals were developed around community concerns. \\n \\nGoal 1:  The consortium members are participating in the DCFS Nevada System of Care \\nExpansion Grant [Exhibit F].  The partnership is helping to improve and expand mental \\nhealth services, specifically in rural communities.  Some of these expansions include respite \\ncare, increased psychiatric services, and early childhood mental health services.  We also \\nwork closely with peer support groups, including Youth MOVE Nevada, National Alliance \\non Mental Illness, and Parents Educating Parents, Inc.   \\n \\nGoal 2:  There are limited providers in rural communities, and we facilitated partnerships \\nsuch as with school social workers to promote early detection in schools.  We have helped \\nprovide items to rural providers such as art supplies to carry out the goals of a youth\\'s \\ntreatment plan. \\n \\nGoal 3:  We are supporting the expansion and continued funding of the rural Children\\'s \\nMobile Crisis Response Team.  The service is now 24/7 and is often the point of entry for \\nyouth and families.  In fiscal year 2021, rural mobile crisis has had an 84.3 hospital diversion \\nrate, meaning that 84.3 of the youth we had contact with were able to be stabilized in their \\nhome communities.   \\n \\nGoal 4:  The consortium supported and joined the system of care in offering training to over \\n70 rural clinicians in becoming certified telehealth providers.  We are also working on a plan \\nto bring health equity training to rural communities. \\n \\nGoal 5:  The consortium has completed a memorandum of understanding with the Nevada \\nSystem of Care to serve as a designated point of contact for youth, families, and other \\nprovider input.  We are also working with behavioral health policy boards in the rural and \\nfrontier counties. \\n \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 15, 2021 \\nPage 6 \\n \\nRegarding the impact of the pandemic, the severity of symptoms seems to have increased in \\n2020.  Youth are reporting more lethal, violent, suicidal thoughts such as hanging, jumping \\ninto traffic, and firearms.  This is possibly due to the increase in isolation, but due also to \\nincreased screen time during COVID-19 restrictions.  Families are needing more intensive \\ncase  management.    They  are  struggling  to  provide  the  basic  necessities  such  as  food, \\nclothing, and shelter, and these financial stressors are associated with COVID-19.  \\n       \\nFor youth needing to be hospitalized for safety, rural mobile crisis reports see longer wait \\ntimes  in  emergency  rooms.    Perhaps  one  of  the  issues  is  COVID-19  testing  before \\ntransporting.  A rapid test may not always be available; it would sometimes take days for test \\nresults to came back so the youth could be transported. \\n \\nOur state continues to see a shortage of acute psychiatric hospital beds, especially for youth \\nbetween the ages of 5 and 15.  Last week we had a ten-year-old who waited in the emergency \\nroom for days before a bed was available.  Transportation continues to be an issue for rural \\nfamilies trying to access mental health services.   \\n \\nThere are some strengths.  We have collaborated with the suicide prevention and rural mobile \\ncrisis teams.  They have partnered to provide rural families with gun locks, medication safes, \\nand prescription disposal bags.  Youth are getting outpatient services more quickly with the \\nincrease in telehealth providers.  With more mental health services needing to be done via \\ntelehealth, Medicaid has enacted an expansion that allows mental health providers to be \\nreimbursed for telehealth and phone-health services at the same rate as inpatient services.  \\nThis  expansion  has  helped  mental  health  services  in  rural  Nevada  flourish  during  the \\npandemic.  The consortium is hopeful this expansion will continue even after the pandemic.   \\n \\nIt is our hope that this overview of our efforts demonstrates the importance of providing \\nchildren\\'s mental health services in all areas of the state.  Rural areas are challenging, but the \\nlessons of the community discussion events demonstrate the pride each community takes in \\ntheir efforts with other stakeholders to provide children with the needed health care in their \\nown communities. \\n \\nDan Musgrove, Chair, Clark County Children\\'s Mental Health Consortium: \\n[Dan Musgrove submitted additional information not discussed Exhibit G].  I have been \\nworking on mental health issues locally and with the state Legislature for over 20 years.  \\nI would like to call your attention to this slide, which is our strategic plan\\'s overarching goals \\n[page 9, Exhibit C].  There are six of them.  In 2001, the Legislature created the local \\nconsortiums.  There is also a statewide consortium I work with that includes the members of \\nboth Washoe County and the rural counties.  Much of what you have already heard from \\nWashoe and the rurals is happening in Clark County as well, but probably to a greater degree \\nbecause of our larger population. \\n \\nOn this slide [page 10] is the progress being made on the top four priorities of the Clark \\nCounty Consortium, and particularly on Nos. 3 and 4.  There is a current investigation being \\nconducted by the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice dealing with \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 15, 2021 \\nPage 7 \\n \\nwhether the State of Nevada is unnecessarily relying on institutionalization to treat children \\nwith behavioral health conditions.  When you look at our Items 3 and 4, those are issues we \\nhave seen for a number of years that we believe could have helped to deal with that issue.  \\nThe benefit of these consortiums lies in their membership, and it includes state agencies, \\ncounty agencies, the school districts, and parents.  All of them are tremendous advocates on \\nbehalf of children.  But as we know, dealing with budgets and restrictions and sometimes just \\nan inability to move the needle, sometimes things get out of hand, and I think we have an \\nissue of over-hospitalization.  Also, we do not have capacity here in the State of Nevada.  We \\ndo not want children to have to access long-term treatment:  we want to see wraparound care \\nand mobile crisis teams—those are all items we hope would keep kids out of long-term \\nresidential treatment facilities.  However, in Clark County, we do not have a lot of beds.  The \\nmajority of beds are in Reno or out of state which does not help kids or families at all.  As \\nyou can see in our Items 3 and 4, we need more service array options because we have not \\nseen progress.  \\n \\nDuring the 2015 Session, Assembly Bill 307 of the 78th Session was passed in both houses \\nand that attempted to address many of these issues.  It was a pilot program that would have \\nlooked  at  the  intensive  care  coordination  services  for  children  with  behavioral  health \\nneeds who reside in Clark and Washoe Counties.  The funding, however, was never there, so \\nA.B. 307 of the 78th Session never was implemented or tried.  Maybe we would have seen \\nsome help in those areas.  It is all about having a complete service array to help children and \\nfamilies. \\n \\nAnother thing the Chair wanted us to talk about was the impact of COVID-19.  We already \\nhave  a  stress  system  that  has  an  impact  on  youth  and  families.    These  children  have \\nexperienced everything:  fear, grief, loss of loved ones, anxiety about COVID-19, the issues \\nof  their  own  family  finances,  dealing  with  online  learning,  the  isolation,  the  disrupted \\nrelationships.  Imagine children with disabilities and mental health needs having to deal with \\nthe additional burdens of remote learning as parents and their caregivers attempt to meet their \\nneeds in a home setting, in the absence of having a lot of the necessary supports and services \\nthey normally would have. \\n \\nWe have received lots of testimony from parents and mental health professionals about the \\nmethods schools are using to hold kids accountable, and it is harmful to these students.  We \\nsee reports that schools are being punitive in the online environment.  Students are already \\nexperiencing stress and anxiety about lower or failing grades, but they are receiving warnings \\nthat they might be retained; they are getting tired of uncomfortable screen time and threats of \\nclass failure, and threats of not even graduating. \\n \\nWe in Clark County have recognized the extreme challenges faced by the children and we \\nbelieve you have to work on strategic and sustained planning efforts to help develop more \\nsystems of care for these children especially.  The effects of the pandemic will be long-\\nlasting, especially in the absence of adequate service array, so the mental health of children \\nand their families needs to be prioritized.  And, above all else, compassion and understanding \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 15, 2021 \\nPage 8 \\n \\nare needed so students and families feel supported, rather than punished, for this situation \\nthat is not within their control. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nWhen I asked the children\\'s mental health consortia to present, I asked them to highlight \\nsome of the key issues and priorities for their regions.  Are there any questions?   \\n \\nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \\nMs. Johnson, could you send your rural consortium\\'s list of goals, please? \\n \\nPamela Johnson: \\nAbsolutely, we can do that. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \\nMay I have some specifics about some of what you all reported?  When you are speaking of \\nincreases in suicidal thoughts, are these children who are already receiving services in your \\nconsortiums or are these new children who are now seeking help?  Who is collecting and \\ntracking this data? \\n \\nPamela Johnson: \\nIt is all the things you have mentioned—they are new, they are children in service, and they \\nare also family members.  We get the information from suicide prevention centers and \\nmobile crisis units. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \\nIs there a standard vetting procedure for this data, this intake?  I hear about the increases, but \\nI want to be sure we are gathering this data in a manner that is quantifiable so we can refer to \\nit with confidence.  Then we would be able to find resources and act on it because we have \\ndata that has been collected in a manner that is consistent with some kind of metric that is \\naccepted in the industry. \\n \\nJacqueline Kleinedler: \\nOne of the problems we see is the scattered approach to data collection about the topic of \\nincreased reports of anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts among youth.  One of the \\nways the consortium is addressing this is to pull from multiple data sources.  We ask \\ndifferent agencies in our community that work directly with youth.  We invite them to give \\npresentations.    For  example,  the  Human  Services  Agency  of  Washoe  County  gives \\npresentations,  The  Children\\'s  Cabinet  gives  presentations,  and  Quest  Counseling  and \\nConsulting gives presentations.  We ask the school district to attend meetings, and they share \\ninformation with us.   \\n \\nTo my knowledge, there is no standardized mechanism for collecting data.  There is also a \\nlag between when the data is collected and presented and when we are able to formulate a \\nresponse to that information.  Your question about data is important and an area where we \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 15, 2021 \\nPage 9 \\n \\ncould use a lot of support in figuring out how to track, how to report, and how to respond to \\nthe trends we see. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \\nI spoke with an organization not long ago about this issue.  They told me they use Centers for \\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) data.  Have you considered adopting that metric, that \\nprocess, so that each of the organizations that are reporting to your consortium are using the \\nsame standards?  That way we would have something consistent to refer to.  We are hearing \\nconflicting things.  I am a brand new legislator; I am learning every day; but I am hearing \\ndata from one hand and then the other on an issue that is this serious and requires action.  \\nPeople from different perspectives are putting forth their data and if it is not consistently \\ncollected, I do not know if that data is being presented in a manner that is for the individual \\nor the organization\\'s benefit, or if it is for the benefit of all.  I want the data I receive to be \\nconsistent, so I know how this is affecting everyone, not an organization or institute that has \\na motive—except that they care about the kids.  That is what I am concerned about. \\n \\nMegan Freeman: \\nThere is a survey taken here in Nevada called the \"Youth Risk Behavior Survey\" that is \\nconducted using the CDC criteria.  It is conducted by the University of Nevada, Reno, and in \\n2019 every Nevada middle and high school participated in that survey.  That is an amazing \\nsource of data.  I do not know whether any other places try to survey every eligible youth in a \\nstate.  They will start data collection on the 2021 survey in the fall.  It was scheduled for the \\nspring, but was pushed back due to the pandemic.  I would be happy to make sure you have a \\ncopy of some of the recent findings from that survey. \\n \\nI also want to talk about data from different agencies, including children\\'s mobile response.  \\nUsually that is data that is collected in the course of routine clinical care.  Typically, that is \\ncollected in a different way for a different purpose than epidemiological data, like what is \\ncollected by the CDC, and so the questions will be asked in a slightly different way because \\nit is done for a different purpose.  There are complementary approaches, and we want to \\nmake sure to use both so we have a comprehensive understanding of the problem and how to \\naddress it. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nIf there is any additional information, please get that to Patrick Ashton so he can distribute it \\nto the entire Committee. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Titus: \\nThank you for your presentations.  I appreciate all you are doing, all you are trying to do, and \\nthe challenges ahead of you.  I want to make sure all the consortiums, Washoe, rural, and \\nClark, are communicating with the other mental health consortiums so that we are not \\noperating in silos.  I have not heard of any joint ventures.  I would like to know that you are \\ncommunicating with the other behavioral health care boards, the other mental health boards, \\nand not living in separate silos. \\n \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 15, 2021 \\nPage 10 \\n \\nDan Musgrove: \\nI can speak on behalf of Clark and some of the other consortiums.  As you know, we are \\nadvocates for children and we have a responsibility to prepare these reports.  We provide \\nthem to both the Commission on Behavioral Health as well as to Director Whitley of the \\nDHHS.  Two other members of the Clark consortium and I also serve on the Clark County \\nRegional Behavioral Health Policy Board.  A number of the other regional policy boards \\nhave ceded the work on children to the consortiums, and we report what we are doing to the \\nregional behavioral health policy boards.  That way, they are not doing the same work we are \\ndoing.  We do have a statewide children\\'s consortium where we all come together.  You are \\nabsolutely right.  We want to make sure there are no silos and all of us are working off the \\nsame sheet of music. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Titus: \\nI just want to make sure there is not duplication of effort because we have such a limited \\nsupply of funds and volunteers.  We need to make sure we are all working together and that it \\nis a joint venture for all Nevadans. \\n \\nOn  the  Washoe  County  consortium\\'s  presentation,  they  mentioned  toxic  stress.    In  my \\nexperience, we are getting away from those terms and using something called ACEs—\\nadverse childhood experiences.  Have we seen a resurgence of toxic stresses with the current \\nCOVID-19 pandemic, or is that still something that has morphed into this more general term \\nfor adverse childhood experiences? \\n \\nJacquelyn Kleinedler: \\nThose two concepts are complementary.  When we are describing toxic stress in our ten-year \\nplan and in our forward goals, what we are talking about is the stressors children face that are \\nchronic, ongoing, and that require buffering, resiliency factors, or protective factors to be \\nintroduced in order to prevent that toxic stress from creating long-term effects for that child. \\n \\nWhen we talk about adverse childhood experiences, we are referring specifically to the \\nstandardized or the most normative ACE screening tool.  That has been used in research as \\nthe correlative factor for ongoing problems for adults ranging from health to mental health to \\nsubstance use to parenting issues. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Titus: \\nFor Committee members who may not know, the toxic stress rankings came out in around \\n2010 and involve positive stresses, tolerable stresses, and toxic stresses.  Right now, I think  \\n \\nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \\nI have a question regarding the limited number of beds we have for the children.  What \\nhappens if the children have to be hospitalized?  Where do they go once we run out of those \\nbeds? \\n \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 15, 2021 \\nPage 11 \\n \\nMegan Freeman: \\nOccasionally, they have to stay in the emergency room or a medical hospital, and sometimes \\nthey do go out of state. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \\nDo you have an estimate of how many children are being sent out of state, and by out of \\nstate, are we talking about Arizona, California, or Utah, or are they going to Kansas or \\nTexas? \\n \\nMegan Freeman: \\nTypically, whoever places the youth tries to keep them as close to home as possible.  Many \\nyouth do go to Utah and Arizona.  We have that data publicly available, and we can get that \\nto you to make sure you have all the information in detail. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nThank you for your presentations.  If any Committee members have any follow-up questions, \\ncomments, or concerns, please follow up with our individual speakers.  With that, I will \\nmove on to our next presentation—an overview of Medicaid. \\n \\nSuzanne  Bierman,  Administrator,  Division  of  Health  Care  Financing  and  Policy, \\nDepartment of Health and Human Services:   \\nThank you for the opportunity to present a very high-level overview of Nevada Medicaid and \\nits relationship to the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services (DWSS).  Today, we will \\nbe presenting an overview of Medicaid, how it works, the eligibility process, how it is \\ndelivered, a description of some of the benefits and services that are provided, how the \\nfederal and state programs work together, and how that works out for Nevadans, the state, \\nhospitals, doctors, and others [page 2, Exhibit H]. \\n \\nMedicaid is the state\\'s largest insurer and provides significant funding for hospitals, Federally \\nQualified Health Centers, nursing homes, and many other health care providers.   \\n \\nRobert Thompson, Deputy Administrator, Division of Welfare and Supportive Services, \\nDepartment of Health and Human Services: \\nThis is a joint presentation because DWSS operates the application and eligibility side of \\nNevada Medicaid for thousands of Nevadans a year [page 3].  Once a person is found \\neligible, we transmit that data, and our partners at Nevada Medicaid take over. \\n \\nSuzanne Bierman: \\nThe Division of Health Care Financing and Policy (DHCFP) is payor.  We currently are \\nserving over 810,000 Nevadans, a significant increase from pre-COVID-19 days.  Medicaid \\nis a health insurance program.  It provides coverage for low-income children and adults, \\nseniors, and people with disabilities.  In challenging economic times, Medicaid provides \\ntemporary help for people who lose their jobs or become too sick to work.  All Nevadans \\nwho meet eligibility requirements are guaranteed coverage under Medicaid. \\n \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 15, 2021 \\nPage 12 \\n \\nNevada Medicaid functions in many ways like commercial insurance.  We enroll providers, \\nprocess and pay claims, provide oversight of provider billing, and monitor utilization and \\nmanagement, just to name a few activities.  The Division currently has a little over 300 \\nemployees. \\n \\nThis is a slide we often use [page 4, Exhibit H].  We think it is important and provides a \\nhigh-level overview of some of the impacts of the program for Nevadans.  As I mentioned, \\nwe have seen such an increase in our enrollment that Nevada Medicaid now covers one in \\nfour Nevadans.  When I did this presentation two years ago, that figure was one in five.   \\n \\nNevada Medicaid makes up a large percentage of the state budget at nearly 30 percent of \\nstate expenditures.  We cover a lot.  Sixty percent of the births in the state are covered by \\nMedicaid, and it is also the single largest payor of nursing home care and long-term services.  \\nI want to note that Nevada Medicaid covers services that are not always covered by other \\ncommercial insurance programs or even Medicare.  Back to the point about Nevada Medicaid \\nbeing the primary payor for long-term care services, that is because many other commercial \\ninsurance programs and, outside of a certain day limitation, Medicare, do not reimburse for \\nthose services.  So this is just another way Medicaid serves as a safety net for the state. \\n \\nOur enrollment has definitely changed due to the public health emergency in the COVID-19 \\npandemic.  I will spend some time on this slide, which is prepandemic, but it points out that \\nNevada has a higher rate of uninsured than the average across the United States [page 5].  \\nWhile we note that this has changed during the pandemic, I think it is important to note that, \\nhistorically, Nevada has had a higher rate of uninsured compared to the rest of the nation. \\n \\nThis slide shows our current Medicaid caseload as of January 2021 and the trends over the \\ncourse of the last year [page 6].  You can see that uptick due to the COVID-19 public health \\nemergency, and you can see that we have continued to see increases in our enrollment, but \\nnot at as such a steep rate as earlier in 2020. \\n \\nThese sorts of increases in the Medicaid program as the economy worsens are not surprising.  \\nMedicaid is what is called a counter-cyclical program.   That means when the economy \\nworsens, its caseload goes up.  We are certainly seeing that here, and it is an expected trend \\nin Medicaid programs as states face tough economic times. \\n \\nA piece of federal legislation passed in early 2020 has some implications for our caseload, \\nand that is the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA), which has brought some \\nadditional federal funding to the state.  However, along with that has come maintenance of \\neffort requirements for eligibility.  That requires continuous Medicaid eligibility during the \\ntime of the public health emergency.  We expect to see these types of trends continue as the \\neconomy worsens.  Another contributing factor to our increasing caseload is due to that \\nrequirement of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.  Almost half of our recipients \\nare parents and children, then adults, and about 20 percent are in other eligibility categories, \\nincluding individuals with disabilities.   \\n \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 15, 2021 \\nPage 13 \\n \\nRobert Thompson: \\nInformation on the next few slides shows how Nevadans access Medicaid.  They apply to \\nMedicaid through processes within DWSS [page 7].  You might wonder why there are two \\ndifferent state divisions that administer Medicaid.  It is common in other states to see one \\nstate agency that handles both the eligibility determinations for the public, and that works for \\nthe  payors;  however,  in  Nevada,  DWSS  does  more  than  just  determine  eligibility  for \\nMedicaid.  Nevada is somewhat unique in our approach to administering Medicaid.  Often in \\nstates where Medicaid is a single agency, there are other, separate agencies for social services \\nthat serve similar populations.  In other states, a person in need would be required to travel to \\none government office or agency to apply for food assistance such as Supplemental Nutrition \\nAssistance Program (SNAP) and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), \\nwhich is welfare, and then travel to another agency to apply for Medicaid.  In the early \\n1990s, Nevada integrated these systems to remove the administrative burden from the public \\nand put the burden on the state to provide one streamlined process to access multiple benefits \\nto persons or families who need it. \\n \\nIn Nevada, we have organized our access so that several other major social services programs \\ncan be accessed at the same entry point.  These other programs include SNAP, TANF, \\nour energy assistance program, and our child care development program.  In addition to \\nadministering  these  programs,  the  Division  is  the  state-level  child  support  enforcement \\nauthority,  and  we  have  provided  administrative  support  to  the  homeless  housing  board \\ncommission.  This was done in an effort to create a one-stop shop for persons in need.  While \\nmany people receiving Medicaid, SNAP, and TANF can and do work, for those who are not \\nemployed, the Division administers workforce development programs to create pathways for \\npeople  so  they  can  improve  their  potential  and  contribute  to  their  communities.    For \\nindividuals on SNAP, the workforce program is called SNAP Employment and Training, or \\nyou may hear us refer to it as SNAP E&T.  For individuals on TANF, the workforce \\ndevelopment is called New Employees in Nevada, also referred to as NEON. \\n \\nYou might imagine that, with the additional programming features and the complexity of \\nMedicaid\\'s financial employment obligations, it became necessary to divide the duties for \\nMedicaid and its two different divisions.  That change was made by the Nevada Legislature \\nin the 1990s.  \\n \\nThere are two ways to apply for Medicaid [page 8].  The first way is through referrals, and \\nthe majority of our referrals come from Nevada Health Link, also referred to as the health \\nexchange.  Nevada Health Link reviews all marketplace applications because if anyone \\napplying for coverage may be eligible for Medicaid or Nevada Check Up, depending on \\nincome limits, and if an applicant appears to be eligible for Medicaid, the application is \\nreferred  to  us  for  processing  with  no  additional  application  required  from  the  person \\napplying.  These applicants then receive correspondence about their case from us.  The \\nreason  there  is  no  additional  and  separate  application  required  is  because  the  Patient \\nProtection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) required a streamlined application process for \\nMedicaid coverage.   \\n \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 15, 2021 \\nPage 14 \\n \\nAnother referral system is for hospitals to apply on behalf of a patient, and a hospital can get \\nbenefits through what is known as hospital presumptive eligibility.  This method does require \\npeople to follow through with an additional regular application if they want to maintain their \\ncoverage.  There are additional quality control measures that the welfare division puts in \\nplace to make sure those claims are being paid appropriately and are not fraudulent. \\n \\nCustomers can also apply directly with us.  We refer to this as click-in, call-in, mail-in, or \\ncome-in.  We encourage all our customers to apply online through Access Nevada.  It is the \\nmost efficient system for them and us.  But customers can also verbally apply over the phone \\nto our call center.  A lot of people do not know that.  With Medicaid, we have an approved \\nwaiver for the person to verbally apply and verbally sign the application over the phone.  \\nThere may be additional paperwork to do, but that initial application can be done verbally. \\n \\nWe receive applications via mail or through our drop boxes, and the final method is in \\nperson, which, obviously, was pre-COVID-19.  Either in our DWSS offices or as part of \\ngrowing outreach initiatives, we have set up many access points that are nontraditional such \\nas  in  homeless  shelters,  family  court,  community  centers,  and,  in  some  cases,  even  in \\ndetention centers.  We plan to reactivate those, post-COVID-19. \\n \\nOnce DWSS has received the application for assistance, we have to evaluate the household \\ncircumstances to determine if they are eligible [page 9, Exhibit H].  Medicaid is approved at \\nno  cost,  while  Nevada  Check  Up  has  quarterly  premiums.    The  primary  eligibility \\ndeterminations look at gross income, citizenship, household composition, residency, and, in \\nsome cases depending on the program being applied for, we have to look at their resources \\nand assets.  Those are primary eligibility reasons; there are multiple factors in eligibility.  \\nThis slide also includes a snapshot of eligible income categories.  Taking a household of one \\nfor example, if we were looking at a single adult without children, not pregnant, and not \\ndisabled, if that person\\'s income level fell within 138 percent of poverty, so as long as the \\nindividual is making under $1,483 a month, that person would be eligible for Medicaid. \\n \\nA second example could be a single parent with two children—so a household of three.  \\nBecause there are children in the home, we would look at 205 percent of poverty, so that \\nfamily could have up to $3,752 of gross monthly income and remain eligible for Medicaid \\nassistance and that 205 percent is for Nevada Check Up.  At this point, our agency would \\napprove the case, transmit the data to Nevada Medicaid, and they would take over the case \\nfrom there.  They would issue the Medicaid cards and would become the enroller and the \\npayor.   \\n \\nSuzanne Bierman: \\nAs was mentioned, once DWSS has approved an application for Medicaid, DHCFP begins \\nthe Medicaid enrollment process.  Nevada Medicaid uses two different service delivery \\nmodels—managed care and fee-for-service [page 10].  Managed care is the primary model, \\ncovering 72 percent of the recipients in the state.  It is available in the urban counties of \\nClark and Washoe, and to all eligibility groups except for the aged, blind, and disabled.  \\nNevada Medicaid currently contracts with three managed care organizations (MCOs) to \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 15, 2021 \\nPage 15 \\n \\nprovide care under this model.  Individuals can choose among these three organizations as \\npart of their eligibility application process, and the selected managed care organization will \\nthen provide a welcome packet with information about insurance coverage to the Nevada \\nMedicaid member.  In the instance that a recipient does not choose among the three MCOs, \\nthere is a process for auto-assigning those members to one of the three MCO plans. \\n \\nFee-for-service is the other service delivery model that is used by Nevada Medicaid.  In this \\nmodel,  DHCFP  performs  many  of  the  same  functions  and  activities  as  a  commercial \\ninsurance plan would, such as provider enrollment and claims processing.  Fee-for-service \\ncovers Nevadans in rural areas and the aged, blind, and disabled population.    \\n \\nOn this slide, we have an overview of some of the benefits and services provided by Nevada \\nMedicaid [page 11].  This is not the full list and is just for illustrative purposes and to \\ndescribe one element of the federal-state framework.  The program, of course, is jointly \\nadministered  between  the  state  and  the  federal  government,  and  certain  services  are \\nmandatory  and  must  be  provided  by  all  states.    Other  services  are  optional.    The \\nmandatory/optional service set up in the Medicaid program accounts for one of the reasons \\nyou see variation in Medicaid programs across states.  As I said, this is not a full list, but I \\nwanted to note this mandatory/optional distinction.   \\n \\nNevada  Medicaid  does  provide  comprehensive  coverage  for  children.    The  benefit  for \\nchildren is what we refer to as EPSDT, which is early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and \\ntreatment services.  For the Medicaid expansion adults, Nevada Medicaid does cover the ten \\nessential health benefits.  Those are the same benefits that the ACA required to be covered by \\nNevada Health Link, so there is some continuity of coverage as individuals have changes in \\ntheir income and may transition from Medicaid to exchange coverage or vice versa.  In \\naddition to those benefits, Medicaid also provides coverage for some services and benefits \\nthat other commercial insurers typically do not cover.  An example of that is nonemergency \\nmedical transportation and long-term care.  There is also a link here to the Centers for \\nMedicare  and  Medicaid  Services  (CMS)  website  for  the  full  listing  of  mandatory  and \\noptional services. \\n \\nWe often get questions concerning why Medicaid had not paid for a particular service, so I \\nwanted to go over the four high-level requirements for Medicaid reimbursement [page 12].  \\nWhen  Medicaid  pays  for  services  for  Medicaid-eligible  and  enrolled  individuals,  only \\nproviders who are enrolled in Medicaid will be reimbursed.  Also, it must be a Medicaid-\\ncovered service, which goes back to that optional list.  Is this a service that is included in \\nMedicaid\\'s benefit package?  Last, is the service medically necessary?   \\n \\nI want to talk about the program\\'s overall authority and how it is jointly administered \\nbetween the federal and state governments [page 13, Exhibit H].  The federal agency with \\nwhom we work closely to administer this program is CMS.  To qualify for federal matching \\nfunds, states must operate their Medicaid program in accordance with federal law and must \\nfile a state plan and state plan amendment with CMS.  The state plan is basically the contract \\nbetween the state and the federal government that describes how the state administers its \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 15, 2021 \\nPage 16 \\n \\nMedicaid  program.    It  outlines  the  state  rules  and  operating  protocols  for  program \\nadministration.  It is the primary authority that governs Medicaid services.  However, waivers \\nare also available to states when they need additional flexibility beyond what is available in \\nstate plan authority to design their programs. \\n \\nAs an example, Nevada has three program waivers which are 1915(c) home- and community-\\nbased  waivers  that  allow  Nevada  to  offer  home-  and  community-based  services  as  an \\nalternative to care in facilities.  These waivers allow the state to impose limits on program \\nenrollment that are otherwise not allowable under state plan authority.  Those are jointly \\noperated by the Aging and Disability Services Division with oversight responsibility by \\nDHCFP. \\n \\nIn addition to program waivers there are also options for research and demonstration waivers, \\noften referred to as Section 1115 waivers.  These waivers allow states to test program \\nfeatures that are otherwise not provided for or allowed under federal Medicaid law.  These \\nSection  1115  research  and  demonstration  waivers  must  advance  the  objectives  of  the \\nMedicaid program and are subject to stringent budget neutrality requirements that require \\nactuarial analysis.  They are generally approved for five years.  If you think of this as a \\ncontinuum between the standard and something that would be more of an exception to the \\ngeneral rule, you have state plan and then program waivers, and then there are Section 1115 \\nresearch  and  demonstration  waivers  when  the  state  needs  to  work  with  the  federal \\ngovernment to try to design a program to meet state needs in a new and innovative way.   \\n \\nHere is a little information about how the program is jointly administered [page 14].  The \\nfederal government pays for the majority of the cost of the Medicaid program in Nevada.  \\nMedicaid is typically the single largest source of federal aid to the states.  The federal \\ngovernment matches state Medicaid spending on an open-ended basis.  The diagram here \\ndemonstrates how this works with the fee-for-service model where the federal government \\nand the state pay providers.  In the managed care model, the funding comes from the state \\nand federal government to the MCOs, and those organizations then pay the providers. \\n \\nThis slide shows something you will hear a lot about—FMAP, which is the federal medical \\nassistance percentage [page 15].  This is additional information on the percentage of the \\noverall Medicaid program that is paid for with federal funds.  Across all the Division\\'s \\nservices, the federal government is paying anywhere from 64 percent up to 92 percent of the \\ncosts.  You can also see on this chart that two of the rows in this table show \"with FFCRA.\"  \\nThat is the federal legislation I mentioned earlier when talking about enrollment that has \\nsome implications related to maintenance of effort, requirements for eligibility, along with \\nthe enhanced funding you can see on the slide.  I will also note that this enhanced funding \\nunder the Families First Coronavirus Response Act is tied to the time frame of the public \\nhealth emergency, so Nevada Medicaid is getting enhanced federal funding throughout the \\npublic health emergency.  It has to be updated quarterly whether or not the public health \\nemergency will continue to be extended.  The Biden Administration recently sent a letter to \\ngovernors stating that it understood the need for predictability around the timing of the public \\nhealth emergency and indicating its intention of continuing the public health emergency at \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 15, 2021 \\nPage 17 \\n \\nleast through calendar year 2021.  It also indicated that it would provide states with 60 days \\nadvance notice before termination of the public health emergency. \\n \\nIn summary, I want to note again that during this time of a global health pandemic, Nevadans \\nare increasingly relying on Medicaid.  It is the state\\'s health insurance program for low-\\nincome Nevadans, and it is a safety net during tough economic times.  Medicaid provides \\ncomprehensive coverage and financial protection for many Nevadans.  We do this through \\npartnership with the federal government and providers, and there are a number of additional \\nresources on our website as listed on this slide [page 17].    \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nAre there questions? \\n \\nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \\nGoing back to where you list the federal poverty levels for the Medicaid program [page 9, \\nExhibit H], are those poverty levels across all states?  How do they compare to other states? \\n \\nRobert Thompson: \\nThose poverty levels are provided by the federal government to all states and are based on \\nfederal poverty guidelines. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \\nHow are those amounts determined when someone is applying for eligibility? \\n \\nRobert Thompson: \\nIt depends on the program.  For most programs, we take the current circumstances and \\nproject the future circumstances and determine what their income will be on a month-to-\\nmonth basis.  If a person was working this month, their income was stable, everything was \\nnormal, and they were making under a certain amount, we would approve them.  If they go \\nover this amount this month, but they have verification with them showing that their income \\nhas stopped, that they have recently lost a job, then we would project that the income had \\nstopped.  We are consistently looking at what the current circumstances are and what the \\nfuture projected circumstances are.  That is not true in some of the medical assistance rates or \\nthe aged, blind, or disabled programs.  Some of those programs use actual income on a \\nretroactive basis. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \\nHow often do you redetermine someone\\'s eligibility? \\n \\nRobert Thompson: \\nPre-COVID-19, we determined eligibility annually for all our programs.  Customers are \\nrequired to report to us if there is a change in circumstances.  If their income is to go up, they \\nare required to report that, but we do touch base and do a full analysis at least once a year. \\n \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 15, 2021 \\nPage 18 \\n \\nAssemblyman Matthews: \\nFor a few months we have been trending up.  Most economic indicators are starting to move \\nin the right direction, and we are seeing state unemployment rates go down consistently \\nmonth after month.  Are there any internal projections about when and where those caseload \\nnumbers may finally peak?  When may we see some movement in the other direction as \\nthings start to stabilize further in our economy? \\n \\nSuzanne Bierman: \\nIt is difficult to predict, and we do work closely with DHCFP\\'s office of analytics.  They \\nwork on predicting and projecting caseloads for the department.  We have met with them \\nrecently to take into account the recent news from the Biden Administration that they do plan \\nto continue extending the public health emergency throughout the course of this calendar \\nyear.  For that reason, we think that we will continue to see pretty high caseloads through \\n2021.  Certainly, all of the maintenance of effort for eligibility protections that come along \\nwith the FFCRA will be in place through that time period.  So, we plan to see our current \\nlevels stay about where they are—the same steady increase, but not back to early 2020 rates.  \\nHowever, we do not anticipate seeing any dramatic decreases at least through the period of \\nthe public health emergency. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Titus: \\nYou continue to show increases in Medicaid applicants and potential recipients [page 6, \\nExhibit H].  My question is, where is the slide that shows that you have an increase in \\nMedicaid providers? \\n \\nCody Phinney, Deputy Administrator, Division of Health Care Financing and Policy, \\nDepartment of Health and Human Services: \\nWe have done some research on that for our provider enrollment unit.  We are seeing some \\nincrease in providers and would be happy to send that data over to you.  It was actually more \\nencouraging than I expected it to be.  As you know, people are losing their employment and \\ntherefore their health insurance, but we were not expecting that more providers would be \\ncoming here.  I can only attribute it to the fact that there are more people whose costs are \\nreimbursable by our program; therefore, perhaps, providers are interested in participating \\nmore fully.   \\n \\nAssemblywoman Titus: \\nI am sure the Chair and the whole Committee would like to see that too.  I have frequently \\nreferred the increase in Medicaid applicants to \"giving out more bus passes but no more \\nbuses,\" so it is great to hear that there may be a shift in the positive direction.  I am also \\ninterested in access to care and how long are people waiting to get an appointment with a \\nprovider, so if you could send the Committee that data, we would like that too because it is \\nall relevant. \\n \\nPresumptive eligibility was mentioned and all the criteria for that [page 8].  I think I heard \\nyou say that citizenship was a criteria, even including presumptive eligibility? \\n \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 15, 2021 \\nPage 19 \\n \\nRobert Thompson: \\nWhen I was listing the eligibility criteria, I was meaning the five main criteria that can \\nimpact eligibility.  There are two dozen Medicaid programs we trickle down through, and \\ncitizenship impacts coverage type as we move through those.  I did not mean to imply that \\ncitizenship would turn on or turn off full eligibility, but it is one of those things we evaluate, \\nand it does impact the type of cases that we can approve. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Titus: \\nOne of my biggest concerns, and I think others share this concern, are disparities in health \\ncare and especially sometimes in the prenatal realm and pregnancy issues.  When you \\nmentioned that they could sign up over the phone, I am concerned about that access and \\nwanting  to  make  sure  that  that  application  process  is  bilingual.    Do  they  have  other \\ninterpreters?  I want to make sure it is available to all the folks who truly need it and are \\neligible. \\n \\nRobert Thompson: \\nPreviously, we utilized case managers who were bilingual, and what we found was that we \\ncould not keep the call-wait times equal if we had too many callers who spoke Spanish and \\nnot enough agents that day.  We have a very efficient internal translation team that can \\nconnect our case manager with the translation team that speaks Spanish at any time with no \\nwait, so the waits are the same.  We also have a contract with an outside agency that will \\nconnect with just about any language.  Sometimes that has to be scheduled ahead of time. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Titus: \\nExcellent.  That is critical; thank you for making that happen.  That is very encouraging. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nWhen you are looking at the eligibility rates and income, how often do participants have to \\nhave that eligibility reassessed? \\n \\nRobert Thompson: \\nWhen we approve a person for Medicaid, we notify them that if their income increases above \\na particular amount—and we give them the amount—they are required to notify us by the \\nfifth of the following month of that change so we can reevaluate the case.  Whether we hear \\nfrom a customer or not, we are required to do a full, new, reconfirming application annually \\nto verify all income and nonincome criteria to make sure the household still meets eligibility.  \\nSo, at least once a year. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nI have another question that comes from a constituent who is a provider.  I have been \\nwatching him go through the process of applying to be approved by Medicaid as a provider.  \\nHow long does that process usually take? \\n \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 15, 2021 \\nPage 20 \\n \\nCody Phinney: \\nThe process to become a provider for Medicaid in Nevada is a little bit complex because of \\nour two different delivery models.  The mechanism Nevada uses to meet the regulations that \\nrequire the state to monitor our providers is we have everyone enrolled in our Nevada \\nMedicaid Program—so every provider who wants to be reimbursed for any services through \\nour regular program, which is our fee-for-service enrollment.  If the provider also wants to \\nparticipate with our MCOs, then those MCOs do an additional credentialling process.  Some \\nstates do that in a centralized way where it is one process.  In Nevada, we have them \\nseparated.   \\n \\nThe enrollment into our fee-for-service program is within five days once we get all the \\ninformation that is needed by our contractor who does that.  The managed care applications \\ncan take a little bit longer because those are a more in-depth credentialling process to make \\nsure that standards beyond our fee-for-service program are also met.  The whole process can \\ntake some significant time.  Generally, it is within 90 days, but there are times when it takes \\nlonger than that. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nI want to thank you all for presenting today.  With that, I will close today\\'s presentation and \\nopen the hearing on Assembly Bill 26. \\n \\nAssembly  Bill  26:    Revises  provisions  governing  programs  of  energy  assistance. \\n(BDR 58-298) \\n \\nRobert Thompson, Deputy Administrator, Division of Welfare and Supportive Services, \\nDepartment of Health and Human Services: \\nThank you for allowing us to present Assembly Bill 26 which is housekeeping language that \\nrevises provisions governing programs of energy assistance.  The energy assistance program \\nprovides a supplement to assist qualifying, low-income Nevadans for the costs of home \\nenergy.  Nevada\\'s energy assistance program has two funding sources, the Low Income \\nHome Energy Assistance Program federal block grants and state revenue generated from \\nNevada\\'s Universal Energy Charge (UEC).  You may have seen a small tax added to your \\npower bill.  That tax comes to us to roll out for energy assistance.  The energy assistance \\nprogram year begins July 1, and applications are accepted through June 30.  Applications are \\nevaluated year-round, or until funding is exhausted. \\n \\nEligible households receive an annual one-time benefit customarily paid directly to their \\nenergy providers.  Currently, Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 702.275 is vague regarding the \\nUEC, specified reporting dates of funds received, allocations, and distributions.  This vague \\nwording has caused conflicts and confusion, as these reports are utilized to distribute any \\nremaining UEC funds.  These proposed changes were recommended by the Legislative \\nCounsel Bureau to clarify and specify the dates listed in the NRS to ensure that UEC funds \\nare  distributed  as  intended  in  regulation  and  to  remove  any  room  for  interpretation  of \\nprevious language.  \\n \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 15, 2021 \\nPage 21 \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nDo Committee members have any questions?  It was very straightforward, so I do not see any \\nquestions.  At this point, I will open up for testimony in support, opposition, and neutral on \\nA.B. 26.  To provide testimony, you must register online with the Legislative website.  \\nRegistrants will receive a phone number, meeting ID, and instructions to join the meeting.  \\nPlease remember to clearly state and spell your name and limit your testimony to two \\nminutes.  Staff will be timing each speaker to ensure everyone is given a fair opportunity to \\nspeak.  We will begin testimony in support of A.B. 26.  [There was no one.]  Is there anyone \\non the line in opposition to A.B. 26?  [There was no one.]  Is there anyone in neutral?  [There \\nwas no one.]  Would you like to make any closing statements, Mr. Thompson? \\n \\nRobert Thompson: \\nThank you for letting us present this bill today.  \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nAt this time, I will close the hearing on Assembly Bill 26.  Is there anyone in the queue for \\npublic comment?  [There was no one in the queue.]  At this time, I will close public \\ncomment.  Are there any comments or concerns from Committee members?  [There was no \\nresponse.]  That concludes our meeting for today.

       " '\\nMINUTES OF THE MEETING \\nOF THE \\nASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \\n \\nEighty-First Session \\nFebruary 17, 2021 \\n \\nThe  Committee  on  Health  and  Human  Services  was  called  to  order  by \\nChair Rochelle T.

Committee rules and protocol were explained.] \\n \\nToday, we have a presentation from the Patient Protection Commission and a hearing on \\nAssembly Bill 16.  Most of the bills that came out of the Patient Protection Commission \\noriginated  in  the  Senate.    If  all  goes  well  in  the  Senate,  we  will  hear  those  bills  in \\nthis Committee.  Many people have inquired about the Patient Protection Commission, so \\nI welcome our first presenter.   \\n \\nSara Cholhagian, Executive Director, Patient Protection Commission, Office of the \\nGovernor: \\nI thank Chair Nguyen for allowing me to come to give you an overview of the Commission, \\nto highlight some of our responsibilities, to share some of the work the Commission has \\ndone, and to touch upon some of the proposed legislation the Chair mentioned. \\n \\nThe Patient Protection Commission (PPC) was created through passage of Senate Bill 544 of \\nthe 80th Session [page 2, Exhibit C].  It was sponsored by Governor Steve Sisolak and \\nreceived bipartisan support, passing unanimously in both houses.  We are in the Office of the \\nGovernor.    We  are  dedicated  to  improving  health  care  in  Nevada  through  systematic, \\ncomprehensive  review  of  the  state\\'s  health  care  system  and  challenges  and  initiatives \\nsurrounding the quality, accessibility and affordability of health care in our state.  The \\nCommission is also charged with making informed recommendations to the Legislature and \\nthe Governor to improve health care for all patients. \\n \\nI will share the mission, vision, and values of the Commission through the lens of our \\nGovernor  [page  3].    Governor  Sisolak  saw  this  as  a  way  to  provide  a  forum  for  all \\nstakeholders to come to the table and to work together on the critical task of improving health \\ncare access and affordability for every patient in Nevada.   \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 17, 2021 \\nPage 3 \\n \\nOur team is composed of me, the executive director; Lezlie Mayville, the administrative \\nassistant and policy coordinator; and the policy analyst, a vacant staff position I hope to fill \\nlater this year [page 4].  I would be remiss if I did not thank the other state agencies that were \\nmonumental in helping get the Commission up and running relatively quickly last year.  \\nI would not have been able to do this quickly enough to host our first meeting had it not been \\nfor the assistance of Barbara Richardson, Commissioner of Insurance, Division of Insurance, \\nDepartment of Business and Industry; Heather Korbulic, Executive Director, Silver State \\nHealth  Insurance  Exchange;  and  Richard  Whitley,  Director,  Department  of  Health  and \\nHuman Services, who provided dedicated staff and additional resources to help facilitate this.   \\n \\nThe Commission is composed of 11 members who were appointed by the Governor [page 5].  \\nThey represent experience across the health care spectrum.  Our chair is Dr. Ikram Khan.  \\nMembers serve in a voting capacity.  We have three nonvoting members—Director Richard \\nWhitley, Insurance Commissioner Barbara Richardson, and Heather Korbulic, Executive \\nDirector, Silver State Health Insurance Exchange.   \\n \\nI  will  now  highlight  some  of  the  Commission\\'s  activities  of  the  past  year  [page  6].  \\nThe Commission  held  its  first  meeting  on  February  3,  2020,  and  met  once  more \\non March 2, before Governor Sisolak made his Declaration of Emergency for COVID-19 for \\nthe state to address, contain, and mitigate the effects of COVID-19.  Several meetings were \\npostponed as the Commission followed his directives and guidelines for hosting public \\nmeetings.  On May 19, he requested the Commission to prioritize its work to best serve \\nNevada  in  this  time  of  state  and  national  emergency,  asking  for  assistance  with \\nrecommendations  concerning  long-term  recovery  for  our  state.    On  June  9,  2020, \\nthe Commission  held  its  first  virtual  meeting  and  agreed  to  refocus  the  Commission\\'s \\npriorities.  In that meeting, the Commission also decided to meet  every other Monday \\nthrough August 31, due to the September 1 deadline for submitting bill draft requests to the \\nLegislature.   \\n \\nOn June 22, the Commission met to start identifying issues that negatively impact the quality, \\naccessibility, or affordability of health care under the Commission\\'s new focus.  It held \\nfour more meetings before it acted on the recommendations for bill drafts.  During those \\nmeetings, topics discussed included transparency measures, sustaining available health care \\noptions,  addressing  affordability  for  vulnerable  populations,  improving  public  health \\ncoordination  efforts,  improving  data  collection  and  analysis  for  evidence-based  policy \\nmaking and planning, workforce development, and telehealth—which is part of one of the \\nCommission\\'s bill draft requests.  \\n \\nOn August 31, the Commission voted to request two pieces of legislation to address access \\nand affordability of health care.  I will touch upon that in our next slide.  Following the \\nCommission\\'s work that led up to August, we decided to pause, reflect, and solicit the \\nCommission\\'s feedback on its remaining work for the rest of the year.  We received feedback \\non topics of recommendations, requests for meetings, and developed a priority list of topics  \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 17, 2021 \\nPage 4 \\n \\nfor the Commission to rank.  On November 9, the Commission discussed the summary of the \\npriority indication worksheet.  Through that exercise, the Commission identified four priority \\ntopic areas which remain the current focus of the Commission for its ongoing work plan.   \\n \\nThe current priorities, in no particular order, are a continued review and examination of the \\ncost of health care and the primary factors impacting those costs; a review of health care \\nworkforce issues in Nevada and recommendations to improve access and delivery of health \\ncare; a review of the effects of changes to Medicaid, including the cost and availability of \\nhealth care and health insurance in the state; and a review of the role of the PPC in improving  \\ncoordination and collaboration efforts.  I am proud of the work the Commission has done so \\nfar, especially given the inability to meet in person.  We were able to host 11 public meetings \\nin the middle of a pandemic.  Prior to the pandemic, I did not know how to use Zoom, let \\nalone how to use it in compliance with Nevada Open Meeting Law.  I remain optimistic \\nabout the work we are doing for the betterment of Nevada patients.  I continue to look to \\nmember  engagement  and  continued  discussion  of  their  priorities.    Our  next  meeting  is \\nscheduled for March 15.   \\n \\nI will touch on our proposed legislation [page 7].  As Chair Nguyen indicated, both of the \\npatient protection bills will first be heard in the Senate.  I hope to be speaking to this \\nCommittee relatively soon to have a deeper discussion on the proposed legislation.   \\n \\nSenate Bill 5 is a measure that relates to increasing access for telehealth services and also \\nfocuses on equitable access.  Senate Bill 40 is a transparency measure aimed at enhancing \\npatients\\' health experiences and improving outcomes by implementing measures that help \\nunderstand data trends.  I will now answer any questions members may have about the \\nCommission. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Peters: \\nMy question is about the scope of effort related to the variety of insurance offered in the \\nstate.  At the state level, we have Medicaid and the Public Employees Benefits Program, and \\nthere  are  group  policies  and  others.    Would  you  describe  how  the  Patient  Protection \\nCommission reviews those?  Does it compare them?  Is there a process in place to do that?  \\n \\nSara Cholhagian: \\nThere is no established procedure for having that discussion take place in front of the \\nCommission.  There have been some limited discussions about the topic of various insurance \\noptions.  One commissioner attempted a deeper discussion about public options and health \\ncare reform that was included in a range of options for the Commission to consider as a top \\npriority.  Our agendas are built around presentations or deliberations from Commission \\nmembers focusing on the four priority areas.  That topic fits under our second priority, the \\nCommission\\'s desire to review the effects of changes to Medicaid, including the cost and \\navailability  of  health  care  and  health  insurance  in  the  state.    I  solicit  feedback  from  \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 17, 2021 \\nPage 5 \\n \\ncommissioners to recommend presentations or provide information that I can share for their \\ndeliberation at our meetings.  I foresee discussing that at the Commission but only at the \\nrequest of Commission members as an agenda item.   \\n \\nAssemblywoman Peters: \\nI appreciate the context.  We have quite a scene of insurance to grapple with and a variety of \\nalternatives people can access.  Long-term, I would love to see the Commission dive into \\nwhat equity looks like in the variety of insurance plans and how much of what the state is \\nresponsible for helps to balance or increase equity so all people have access to the coverage \\nthey need.   \\n \\nI  have  a  family  of  five  on  a  single  income.    My  husband  is  a  veteran  with  Veterans \\nAdministration benefits.  We are in a unique position, but it is not the same as a single person \\nwho works for the state or for one of our school districts, for example, or for a retiree who \\ndoes not meet the Medicare threshold.  I look forward to your future work in that area.  \\n \\nSara Cholhagian: \\nI agree with you.  I do not think your experience is unique to the patients in Nevada.  The \\nCommission would like to hear from you about how you think we could look into that.  \\nIf you agree, I could set up a meeting with you to see if we can take a deeper dive into that on \\na future agenda.   \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nAre there any questions from other Committee members?  [There were none.]  I have one.  \\nSenate Bill 5 focuses on telehealth.  Would you talk about discussions that went into that?  \\nOur rural members are familiar with it, as we have had some provisions in place that allow \\nfor better access.   \\n \\nSara Cholhagian: \\nThe Commission\\'s intent for the proposal was aimed at increasing access to telehealth for all \\npatients.  In looking at long-term recovery from COVID-19, we have seen patients using \\ntelehealth to access service.  Several federal waivers were granted through the Public Health \\nEmergency Declaration.  The Commission wanted to codify some of the waivers into Nevada \\nlaw to allow for the expanded service to continue.  In addition, the Commission discussed \\nequitable access and vulnerable populations, but recognized we need to be mindful of the \\nstate\\'s budget and economic recovery.  Even though there were discussions about increased \\nbroadband access that could help facilitate greater access for vulnerable populations in rural \\nareas, we needed to look at policies without a huge fiscal impact.  With inequitable access, \\none provision in the Commission\\'s measure related to creating a data dashboard highlighting \\ndifferent telehealth access and making sure it was posted somewhere so consumers were \\naware.  We have data to start discussions about informed policy decisions for the future.   \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 17, 2021 \\nPage 6 \\n \\nRecognizing we needed to start somewhere, but absent data, the Commission wanted to \\nutilize what the state already has.  There are provisions that tie the data dashboard to the \\nreview of the Commission and require the data be reviewed by our Regional Behavioral \\nHealth Policy Boards.  The intent was to foster collaboration but recognized discussions \\nabout vulnerable populations and health equity need to be at the forefront when you are \\ntalking about future policy recommendations.   \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nAre there other questions from members?  [There were none.]  I am sure we will see more of \\nyou in the future as these bills come to the Assembly.  I would encourage Committee \\nmembers to review the PPC meetings online.  They met often during the health pandemic.  \\nI appreciate the fact they were able to hold 11 meetings during that time.   \\n \\nI will now open the hearing on Assembly Bill 16.   \\n \\nAssembly Bill 16:  Revises provisions related to the issuance of copies of certificates and \\nrecords of birth. (BDR 40-329) \\n \\nCharles Daniels, Director, Department of Corrections: \\nWe are presenting Assembly Bill 16.  What is A.B. 16, and why is it needed?  The Nevada \\nDepartment of Corrections (NDOC) is requesting the ability to process birth certificates prior \\nto the 90-day post release time.  Assembly Bill 16 incurs no cost to the state.  Implementation \\ndoes not increase or reduce the overall number of requests.  And, although the processing \\ntimeline is extended prior to the immediate 90 days post release, the extension will not have \\nany impact on our stakeholders.  To discuss this further, I will turn this over to Deputy \\nDirector Harold Wickham in our northern office.  \\n \\nHarold Wickham, Deputy Director, Operations, Department of Corrections: \\nWe collaborated with the Office of Vital Records.  In accordance with Nevada Revised \\nStatutes (NRS) 440.175, section 3:  \"A person or governmental organization which issues \\ncertified or official copies pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection 2 shall:  (a) Not charge \\na fee for issuing a certified or official copy of a certificate of birth to . . . (2) A person who \\nsubmits documentation from the Department of Corrections verifying that the person was \\nreleased from prison within the immediately preceding 90 days.\"  This limits our ability to \\nprovide offenders the necessary documents upon release, allowing them to be productive \\ncitizens in our communities.  Sometimes, offenders receive merit credits for school courses \\nor vocational training they take, or they have an early release, so our time is made even \\nshorter.  We need to find a way to provide these documents sooner.  We would like to \\nprovide them upon intake.  When offenders come in, we can do the needs assessment and get \\nthe documents started.  Even within our facilities, offenders must have these documents to \\nwork for our prison industry. \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 17, 2021 \\nPage 7 \\n \\nWhy do we need the change?  It basically provides a better continuum of care for the \\noffenders when they leave us.  Formerly incarcerated persons, just like any citizen in our \\ncommunity, need two forms of ID to attain housing, health care, education, employment, \\nvocational training, or a driver\\'s license.  Unfortunately, if they do not have these documents \\nwithin the first few days after being released, it causes problems as offenders cannot get the \\nservices  and  support  they  need.    This  is  when  they  tend  to  revert  to  old  models  and \\nmentalities and ultimately return to our facilities.  Our job is to help reduce recidivism, \\nreduce victimization in the community, and provide a better continuum of care for Nevadans.   \\n \\nI received communication from the Washoe County Public Defender\\'s Office.  They asked \\nme to tell you that they are in support as they were unable to testify today due to a conflict in \\ntheir schedule.   \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nAre there any questions? \\n \\nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \\nThank you for your explanation of this bill.  Will you go acquire inmate information and \\nreach out to vital statistics to get the document for them, or are you recreating something?  \\nWould you explain the process? \\n \\nHarold Wickham: \\nWe do not anticipate changing the process; we want to move it up so we can get the \\ndocuments from vital records earlier.  That way, they are in the offenders\\' hands upon \\nrelease.  \\n \\nElizabeth  Dixon-Coleman,  Statewide  Re-entry  Administrator,  Department  of \\nCorrections: \\nWe obtain birth certificates for inmates who are incarcerated by using the state system for \\nrecords of birth.  We print out the application for Nevada, a state, or a county, depending on \\nwhat they need.  We send them to the vital records departments.  If we begin the process at \\nintake, which we have done over the past year, we get the birth certificates back in a timely \\nfashion.    We  have  found  that  most  states  return  those  birth  certificates  quickly,  while \\nNevada\\'s vital records department has had us wait for the post release. Though we have \\ncollaborated closely with our state agencies, we do a lot of calling back and forth when the \\nrelease dates change or if inmates are involved in programming.  We are not recreating \\na process; we are using a federal statute process for retrieving birth certificate documentation.   \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nSeveral members have asked what \"post release\" is. \\n \\nElizabeth Dixon-Coleman: \\n\"Post release\" is the time after an offender has left the Department of Corrections facility.  \\nThe way it is put in NRS, there is an option for us to get the birth certificate to a released \\ninmate up to 90 days after they are released to home, the street, Division of Parole and \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 17, 2021 \\nPage 8 \\n \\nProbation, Nevada Department of Public Safety, or however they are released back into our \\ncommunities.  At the Department of Corrections, we have found this needs to be done \\npre-release.  As Deputy Director Wickham stated, inmates can obtain jobs inside.  They need \\nto complete an Employment Eligibility Verification Form I-9 and other paperwork in order to \\nbe hired for that.  They need a birth certificate component for that.  We have also found that \\nwhen  offenders  reenter  our  communities,  the  more  documentation  they  have  in  their \\npossession to gain services or anything that will reconnect them to the community, the better \\nit is to have it when they walk out of the gate and not give up to 90 days after release.  We \\nhave found if they do not have housing, wraparound services for obtaining a job, and \\ncontinuum of care services, they will go back to reoffending within 48 hours.  This agrees \\nwith federal statistics. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Titus: \\nI would like to circle back to the bill itself.  Under section 1, subsection 3, paragraph (a), \\nsubparagraph (2), this bill adds the words, \"is imprisoned or.\"  Currently, the statute says we \\ndo not charge a fee for somebody who was just released on parole or someone who is \\nhomeless.  Is that correct? \\n \\nElizabeth Dixon-Coleman: \\nYou are correct.  In reviewing NRS 440.175, under subsection 3, the change in wording is \\ntaking away the word \"post release.\"  It incurs no extra fee now. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Titus: \\nThis only stops Nevada from charging a fee; it does not stop another state from charging \\na fee for documents.  If another state charges a fee, who pays it?   \\n \\nElizabeth Dixon-Coleman: \\nCorrect.  This is only updating NRS to say the timeline has changed.  Nevada currently does \\nnot charge a fee for incarcerated people who want a copy of their birth certificate.  As the \\nlaw stands today, prior to that 90-day post release, our inmates have the option of paying \\nor having family members pay for that ahead of time.  Some inmates have chosen to do that.  \\nIt does not prevent other states from charging for the documents. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Titus: \\nNothing currently stops an inmate or family member from applying at any time, but many \\nmay not be able to afford to do so.  Having ID is critical.  I am supportive of this.  It does not \\nprevent an inmate or a family member with permission to apply for the document at any \\ntime. \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 17, 2021 \\nPage 9 \\n \\nElizabeth Dixon-Coleman: \\nThat is correct.  They can apply at any time and pay for the birth certificate.  It does not \\nprevent them from that action. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Titus: \\nYou talked about IDs.  It is critical for them to have ID when they get out if they need to \\napply for a job or a home.  I wonder about Medicaid enrollment and health insurance.  Does \\nthis have an implication on access to care? \\n \\nElizabeth Dixon-Coleman: \\nYes, it does.  The more ID they have, whether a birth certificate or a social security card, \\nwhen they apply for Medicaid, health services, or housing, the better it is for the continuum \\nof care for those wraparound services.  It is NDOC\\'s mission, and has been over the past \\nthree years, to connect returning citizens with those documents so there is no delay or break \\nin care.  We use those documents in applying for Medicaid services to make sure those \\nservices are connected for each of the reentering citizens.  We want to see those benefits \\nreconstituted before release so they can be initiated immediately upon release with no break \\nin service. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Titus: \\nI appreciate the Department of Corrections acting as advocates for those who are incarcerated \\nfrom Day One of their incarceration because you need to anticipate their release from the \\nmoment they are incarcerated.  How are you going to help these folks moving forward?  \\nThank you for all you are doing. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \\nI  would  like  some  clarification.    What  happens  if  someone  from  Minnesota  who  is \\nincarcerated and does not have family or money on the books is coming close to the 90 days \\nand needs these vital statistics documents?  What do you do if they do not have resources? \\n \\nElizabeth Dixon-Coleman: \\nThe applications are processed.  Should they earn funds that are put onto their incarceration \\nfunding sources, on their books, they would be charged for the documents upon release.  But \\neach person who is incarcerated is provided with that documentation. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \\nIs there a sum of money given at release that this can be charged back to so the person can \\nleave with the needed documents?  If so, does that leave the person in a vulnerable position \\nwhen leaving if the documents cost a certain amount of money and it is deducted from the \\nfunds that they receive walking out the door? \\n \\nElizabeth Dixon-Coleman: \\nYes, it would be deducted from the funds they receive upon release.  Depending on the fee \\ncharged by the state, fees for birth certificates range from $15 to $43.  It could incur a deficit \\nor a burden upon the reentering citizen. \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 17, 2021 \\nPage 10 \\n \\nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \\nThe reason I am asking this is because I am in Assembly District No. 6.  I have worked with \\nand had numerous conversations with those who are helping the homeless in my district.  The \\nLas Vegas Rescue Mission and many of the services for the homeless are in Assembly \\nDistrict No. 6.  What ends up happening is the municipality ends up incurring the cost of \\nhelping people who cannot afford to have this deducted from their bank when you release \\nthem.  Has there been any discussion with the municipalities about this issue?  Is there a way \\nto set up a reserve so we are not releasing people without documents who have asked for \\nthem, or deducting the fees from the small amount of money they receive when they leave \\nincarceration?    This  is  of  real  concern.    We  do  not  want  to  see  recidivism  in  our \\ncommunities.  We do not want people not asking for these documents because they know \\nthey are only going to have $150 when they come out, and they need to have a room for the \\nnight or get some food.  We also do not want to leave local municipalities with the strain of \\nholding the bag to make sure people are not homeless on our streets.  In Las Vegas, people \\ncannot sleep on the streets.  It creates a cycle if there is not a holistic approach, including \\ncommunication with the municipalities to come up with a solution. \\n \\nChris Franklin, Administrator, Grants and Policy, Department of Corrections: \\nRight now, we have not reached out to municipalities individually.  As you may know, \\nthe Nevada Department of Corrections participates with many of our stakeholders in the \\ncommunity through our Re-Entry Task Force.  They are the first to admit that identification \\nis their biggest problem in being able to provide services to those in need.  As previously \\nstated, this process starts at intake for us.  Most offenders coming in from the county do not \\nhave money in their inmate accounts.  The Inmate Welfare Account fronts that money to \\nthem so they can get their birth certificate, and it is in their files for later use and upon \\nrelease.  If upon release they do not have funds, the dollar amount we have been holding is \\nwritten off.  We are doing everything within our power to try to provide them with the \\nidentification or birth certificate they need.  There may be a family member who wants to get \\nthe documents to them sooner, or there may be  a cost  involved with getting the birth \\ncertificate.  Sometimes, the cost is transferred to the one who needs the documentation. \\n \\nElizabeth Dixon-Coleman: \\nWe have a continuum of care with many of our managed care organizations (MCOs) and \\ncommunity partners.  Should subsidies be needed for obtaining documentation, wraparound \\nservices,  or  housing,  we  try  to  connect  those  being  released  to  the  MCOs  and  other \\nstate-supported community partners that can assist with the deficit.  So, if someone comes \\nout with less money for housing, we try to connect him with those agencies.  If there is a fee \\nor  they  need  to  connect  with  medical  resources,  we  work  with  our  managed  care \\norganizations to help ensure no one is left without those resources.   \\n \\nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \\nNot everyone who is incarcerated has family with extra resources to put money on people\\'s \\nbooks.  If fees are taken out of an inmate\\'s bank during incarceration and the inmate is left \\nwith very little, are we setting up that person to fail?  I am concerned about this because  \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 17, 2021 \\nPage 11 \\n \\nit directly impacts my community.  There is 15 percent unemployment in a large swath of \\nAssembly District No. 6.  The highest homeless population in Clark County is centered in my \\ndistrict.  We need solutions to help people succeed, not to set them up for failure.  It is hard \\nto believe that it is a financial burden for us to make sure that, at the very least, we give \\npeople IDs so they can get these services as they are leaving.  If people have a hard time \\npaying for bail, where will they get money to put on people\\'s books?  I think it is connected \\nfinancially, and I think we must be cognizant of this so we do not set people up for failure.  \\nI do not want to see recidivism because people are desperate.  Desperation is what makes \\npeople do desperate things.   \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nI appreciate your clarification that when people do not have the funds to pay for this, their \\nfees are written off.  I know we have a problem that people who have been granted parole are \\nunable  to  obtain  services—housing  or  other  wraparound  services—so  they  are  still \\nincarcerated.  Do you anticipate getting their identification earlier on will help alleviate some \\nof that? \\n \\nElizabeth Dixon-Coleman: \\nAs they are exiting, we collaborate with Parole and Probation and other state agencies, so this \\nis not a preventative measure.  Having documentation ahead of time will enable those who \\nare released to obtain needed wraparound services.  It would give them time when they are \\nparoled or exiting prison without family supports, if they have those documents ahead of \\ntime, they can get the services they need.  It would not be a preventative act to not release \\nthem because they do not have a birth certificate. \\n \\nHarold Wickham: \\nI think Ms. Dixon-Coleman covered it well.  The Inmate Welfare Account also provides for \\nbirth certificates as needed.  At NDOC, our mission has changed dramatically.  Our goal is to \\nrelease offenders as productive citizens.  We are going to do everything we can, and we want \\nto do it as soon as we can, to get offenders the identification, the necessary documents, \\ntraining, and vocational skills to return to the communities successful.  Our ultimate goal is \\nto protect the community. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nAre there further questions?  [There were none.]  At this time, I will hear testimony in \\nsupport, opposition, and neutral on A.B. 16.  Mr. Wickham indicated the Washoe County \\nPublic Defender\\'s Office was in support.  Is there testimony in support of A.B. 16? \\n \\nJodi Hocking, Private Citizen, Carson City, Nevada: \\nI am both part of an impacted family—my loved one is incarcerated at Southern Desert \\nCorrectional Center—and I am the founder of Return Strong:  Families United for Justice for \\nthe Incarcerated.  I appreciate your time today.   \\n \\nI want to share on a personal level my support for A.B. 16 and providing birth certificates \\nfor incarcerated  people  prior  to  their  release  from  prison.    My  partner  was  released  in \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 17, 2021 \\nPage 12 \\n \\nOctober 2018, after 19 years of incarceration.  He got a voucher to waive the fees for his \\nbirth certificate, which was a help, but it disregarded many of the barriers to transitioning \\ninto society.  Prior to incarceration, he did not live a life that necessarily followed the rules \\nthat many of us follow, so he never had a copy of his birth certificate or social security card; \\nhe never had a driver\\'s license.  But, when he was released, he had all the best intentions to \\nlive what he called a \"square life\"—family and home, working, staying out of the way and \\nout of trouble—a life that followed the rules.  Unfortunately, every corner we turned created \\nmore problems.  It took us four months to actually get his birth certificate because the ID that \\nwas given to him by the prison was under the alias he used when he was arrested.  It was not \\nhis true name, so getting a birth certificate became a barrier to identification, which created \\na dilemma in finding work and getting health insurance to deal with his post-traumatic stress \\ndisorder, in attending school.  He was accepted into a union apprenticeship program, but he \\ncould not provide the correct identification because he did not have a birth certificate.  The \\ncrazy thing is he spent a year asking his caseworker to help him address the problem without \\nbeing able to get that resolved before he was released. \\n \\nHonestly, the frustration and anger created a cycle of depression and hopelessness.  It is hard \\nto describe how deeply it impacted him, so deeply that we started to see him slip away.  He \\nwould always say that he was lost, but it was devastating to him to want so desperately to do \\nthe right thing by all of us and not be able to do it through no fault of his own.  Now, as \\nMr. Wickham and Director Daniels have said happens so many times, he is back in prison on \\na violation.   \\n \\nDo I completely blame the difficulty in getting a birth certificate as the only reason that \\nhappened?  No, it is not that simple.  But I frequently wonder, if the system had set him up \\nfor success, would the result have been different?  I definitely think it could have been.  If we \\nwant to provide people a chance at getting it right, we have to set them up for success outside \\nof  prison.    A  birth  certificate  and  identification  in  their  true  name  would  be  the  bare \\nminimum they could expect.  I am here today in support of A.B. 16.   \\n \\nI want to make an additional comment.  While you were asking questions, I did some \\nresearch.  There are many states that have waivers—even if you live out of state, they \\nprovide waivers for your birth certificate if you are incarcerated.  I agree we need to think \\nabout people who are from other states, but it looks like there is a potential solution to that \\nproblem if we work together.  \\n \\nNick  Shepack,  Program  and  Policy  Associate,  American  Civil  Liberties  Union  of \\nNevada:  \\nI am very happy to be in support of a Nevada Department of Corrections bill, something I do \\nnot  get  to  do  every  day.    Leaving  prison  and  starting  life  is  hard  for  even  the  most \\nwell-supported, formerly incarcerated individual.  Obtaining important documents, such as \\nlicenses, birth certificates, and social security cards, can be a confusing and daunting task for \\nthe average person.  Imagine how hard it is for someone who has spent 20 years or more \\nincarcerated.  The world is different than they remember it.  Simple daily tasks, such as \\nshopping for food, can be overwhelming.  While we are very happy the Department of \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 17, 2021 \\nPage 13 \\n \\nCorrections has decided to try to make this change, if we truly want a system that works to \\nensure successful reentry, we must provide incarcerated people with the tools to succeed.  \\nThis includes important personal documents.  These documents need to be in the possession \\nof their rightful owner upon release.  We urge the Nevada Department of Corrections to work \\nwith us and families on their legislation this session so that we may continue to show up in \\nsupport.  While this bill needs no amendment, we believe we can find common ground on \\nmost of the proposed legislation.  We urge this Committee to pass this simple and meaningful \\nlegislation and continue to work on any effort that will make reentry into society easier for \\nour soon-to-be neighbors. \\n \\nJim Hoffman, representing Nevada Attorneys for Criminal Justice: \\nWe think this is a good bill; we support this for the reasons everyone else has given.  \\nIn response  to  Assemblywoman  Summers-Armstrong\\'s  concern,  we  would  note  there  is \\nanother step that could be taken.  This bill just applies to Nevada Department of Corrections; \\nit  applies  to  people  who  are  in  prison,  but  a  lot  of  people  who  are  incarcerated  for \\nmisdemeanors in county jails also have this kind of problem, and there is nothing in the bill \\nthat helps them.  There is nothing in existing law that helps with it.  We think that would be \\none opportunity to strengthen it, but as previously stated, even without amendment, this is \\na good bill, and we support it.  \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nWe have no more testifiers in support.  Is there anyone in opposition?  [There was no one.]  \\nIs there anyone neutral?  [There was no one.]  Are there any closing remarks? \\n \\nCharles Daniels: \\nThank you for allowing us to present this bill.  We think this is a win/win for everyone.  We \\nlook forward to presenting legislation of this nature before you because we genuinely believe \\nit is impactful and meaningful; there is no downside to this. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nI will close the hearing on A.B. 16.  At this time, I will take public comment. \\n \\nYarleny Roa-Dugan, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \\nI am a registered nurse in Las Vegas.  I am a member of the Patient Protection Commission, \\nand  I  am  an  executive  board  member  of  the  Service  Employees  International  Union \\nLocal 1107.  At this time, I would like to testify on my personal opinion. \\n \\nI  am  here  today  because  this  Committee  heard  an  overview  of  the  Patient  Protection \\nCommission from the executive director.  I feel compelled to speak from my personal \\nexperience  sitting  on  the  Commission  as  one  of  the  two  patient  advocates.    I  have \\nexperienced that having only two patient advocates does not sufficiently represent Nevada \\npatients\\' views, opinions, and concerns.  Also, there is a lack of patient participation during  \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 17, 2021 \\nPage 14 \\n \\nmeetings, and the Commission hears mostly from health care organizations.  If given the \\nopportunity, I would encourage this body to consider my testimony and increase patient \\nadvocates in the commission.   \\n \\nThank you for hearing my testimony.  I welcome the opportunity to further discuss this with \\nyou at any time or answer any questions you may have. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nThere is no further public comment.  Are there any comments from members?  [There were \\nnone.]  Our next meeting will be next Monday, February 22, at 1:30 p.m.  The meeting is \\nadjourned [at 2:37 p.m.] \\n \\n \\n \\nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\nJoan Waldock \\nCommittee Secretary \\n \\n \\nAPPROVED BY: \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\nAssemblywoman Rochelle T.

(BDR 40-\\n288) \\n \\nRique  Robb,  Deputy  Administrator,  Aging  and  Disability  Services  Division, \\nDepartment of Health and Human Services: \\nThank you for the opportunity to introduce Assembly Bill 35.  I will be co-presenting with \\nJeff Duncan, our unit chief.  The intent of this bill is to provide some cleanup language \\nthroughout the chapter; to consolidate the senior and disability prescription drug program to \\nremove the lengthy income and eligibility requirements as well as to align the definitions of \\n\"senior\" and \"persons with disability\" in Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 427A. \\n \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 22, 2021 \\nPage 3 \\n \\nAs you will see throughout A.B. 35, we are proposing to update the statute and also be able \\nto serve a broader scope of individuals beyond just those who are Medicare-eligible.  Our \\nunit chief will walk you through the specific highlights throughout the bill.   \\n \\nJeff Duncan, Unit Chief, Aging and Disability Services Division, Department of Health \\nand Human Services: \\nIn section 1, language has been added to define a \"person with a disability\" which aligns with \\nour definition under NRS Chapter 427A and many of our other Aging and Disability Services \\nDivision programs. \\n \\nSection 2 is cleanup language to add senior citizens and the newly defined \"person with a \\ndisability\" that appeared in section 1.  Sections 2 through 5, 7 through 11, and 14 all include \\nlanguage to consolidate the Nevada Senior and Disability RX Program and the Senior RX \\nProgram.  Both programs receive allocations from the Fund for a Healthy Nevada and make \\nup a single budget account.  They currently operate as a single program. \\n \\nSections 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 through 11 of this bill propose minor cleanup language to ensure \\nservices may be provided to senior citizens and persons with a disability.  In addition, under \\nsection 4, this strikes repetitive language included in other sections of the bill that does not \\nhave an impact on the services throughout. \\n \\nIn section 6, this bill proposes to amend the language of a \"senior citizen\" to \"a person who is \\n60 years of age or older.\"  This definition change of a \"senior citizen\" will align with NRS \\nChapter  427A,  our  independent  living  grant  programs,  and  the  Older  Americans  Act \\nprograms which are all administered by the Aging and Disability Services Division. \\n \\nSection 8 proposes to remove the specific income and eligibility requirements that currently \\ngovern the senior prescription program and the disability prescription program.  There have \\nbeen many changes to Medicare since the inception of these programs, and this change will \\nallow the agency to adapt the program based on need through regulation.  Specifically, this \\nbill will now require a senior citizen or person with a disability who wishes to receive \\nassistance under the consolidated program to be a resident of the state and meet requirements \\nprescribed by regulation under our Department. \\n \\nSection 8 also removes language stating that a senior citizen is entitled to an annual grant \\nunder the program and provides clarifying language that a senior citizen \"or person with a \\ndisability . . . may receive assistance.\"  In addition, section 8 revises language relating to the \\nwaiver eligibility requirements. \\n \\nSection 12 of this bill authorizes information contained in an application for the program to \\nbe shared only for purposes relating to the administration of programs of the Department.   \\n \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 22, 2021 \\nPage 4 \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nI believe we have some questions. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Titus: \\nThank you for bringing this forward.  Definitions are always changing, and we certainly need \\nto stay updated and make sure folks get appropriate services.  I want to make sure these \\nchanges are consistent with what the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) \\nfederal guidelines are.  Since most of Medicare is controlled by the federal government, \\nI want to make sure, especially when we talk about our senior citizens, that it is all consistent \\nwith what the federal government says.  I know there will be some dual enrollees.  We have \\nsenior citizens on Medicare, we have folks who are on Medicaid who qualify for both.  \\nI want to make sure that the federal guidelines are consistent with what you are moving \\nforward.   \\n \\nRique Robb: \\nI will have Jeff Duncan confirm that, but he has been working through CMS guidelines, and \\nI will have him clarify that. \\n \\nJeff Duncan: \\nIt depends on which part of the bill we are talking about.  If you go back to the section \\nconcerning people age 60-plus, Medicare eligibility is still age 65-plus and people with a \\ndisability can qualify, so that is different language.  As far as the current senior disability \\nprescription assistance program goes, we will still align with the Medicare definitions for all \\nages. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Titus: \\nCould we also look at when you are changing assistance?  In section 8, subsection 2, you are \\nchanging those requirements.  What does the federal government look at when it comes to \\nsome of these benefits?  Are these aligned? \\n \\nJeff Duncan: \\nWhat specific line are you speaking to? \\n \\nAssemblywoman Titus: \\nSection 8, subsection 2, where you are striking the Consumer Price Index and some of these \\nqualifications and you are striking the requirement to copay.  I have some concerns over \\nstriking all of that language.  Earlier in your presentation, you said some of the language was \\nduplication and would be picked up in other areas, but this language does not seem to be \\npicked up in other areas.  There is not going to be any copay for prescriptions any longer.  \\nI need some clarification on the decision behind the striking of that particular language. \\n \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 22, 2021 \\nPage 5 \\n \\nJeff Duncan: \\nWe will still have eligibility information in the regulation.  The reason for striking it out of \\nthe law is that Medicare, like many other programs, changes over time, so those are just to \\nallow the agency to adapt the program to meet the needs through regulations.  We will still \\nhave some language that will be spelled out in regulation, just not in the statute. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Titus: \\nIt  is  important  that  we  get  the  legislative  intent  concerning  why  you  are  striking  this \\nlanguage.  So, the intent is to be more fluid.  You want to make sure you are fluid with what \\nthe federal mandates are.  As you and I know, you cannot predict where CMS is going with \\nsome of these regulations, but I want to make sure that what this does is help the state stay \\ncurrent with what the federal mandates are because they supplement us.  It allows you to be \\nmore  fluid  and  current  with  what  the  federal  guidelines  are,  and  your  intent  is  to  use \\nregulations and take it out of statute.  Is that what I am hearing? \\n \\nJeff Duncan: \\nThat is perfectly said. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nI appreciate your having the patience to get that legislative intent on here.  It is always \\nimportant.  I am excited about any bill that consolidates and makes things more efficient.  As \\npeople practicing in the field, we do not have to come back every two years to update things, \\nespecially with the interplay between the federal government and us.  Are there any other \\nquestions? \\n \\nAssemblywoman Peters: \\nI would like clarification.  In section 6, we are redefining \"senior citizen\" to 60 years of age \\nor older, but in section 13 a senior citizen means a person who is domiciled in the state and is \\n62 years of age or older.  Is that on purpose to have those be different?  Can you explain that? \\n \\nJeff Duncan: \\nSection 13 does not apply directly to us; that language is spelling out what is already in NRS.  \\nIf you go back to section 6, that language aligns our chapter with the age that is in the Older \\nAmericans Act which administers similar programs.  Section 13 language does not have an \\nimpact on the other sections of the bill. \\n \\nRique Robb: \\nSection 13 applies to NRS 612.607 and does not relate to this particular program, so we are \\nnot making those changes.  We are only making the relations between Chapters 439 and \\n427A. \\n \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 22, 2021 \\nPage 6 \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nAre there any follow-up questions to the ones asked by Assemblywomen Peters and Titus?  \\n[There were none.]  At this time, we will hear testimony in support, opposition, and neutral \\nof A.B. 35.  Please remember to clearly state and spell your name for the record.  We will \\nlimit your testimony to two minutes, and we will begin with support testimony for A.B. 35. \\n \\nCharlie Shepard, State President, AARP Nevada: \\n[Charlie Shepard submitted written testimony Exhibit C].  Nevada\\'s older adults and persons \\nwith disabilities want to remain living at home, where they want to be.  The Fund for a \\nHealthy Nevada provides a variety of services that help them maintain their independence \\nand stay healthy.  Assembly Bill 35 removes current restrictions and will allow the programs \\nto meet the needs in the community.  AARP Nevada, on behalf of our 345,000 members \\nacross the Silver State, supports A.B. 35 and urges the Committee to pass it to increase the \\nnumber of people who can receive the services they need to stay healthy and independent. \\n \\nBrandy Novicka, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada:  \\nI have been a resident of Nevada since 2006.  I have been through quite a nightmare in my \\nsituation of being disabled.  I have spina bifida, a birth defect.  My nightmare concerns the \\nencounters of trying to get assistance which included Medicaid, Medicare, being a single \\nmother of one child, and having had my third spinal fusion in 2018 and being forced to have \\nto apply for disability.  I was put through a nightmare.  My case was number one in the State \\nof Nevada.  I was turned away from every government agency in Las Vegas.  Why?   We still \\ndo not know.  In June 2019 my daughter and I were homeless.  I am 38 and at the time, my \\ndaughter was 9 years old.  I attended many disability events in Nevada, even spoke to \\nAssemblywoman Titus in regard to my issue.  No one was giving me solutions.  I was simply \\ntold to pretty much go back to where I came from or move to a richer state, and that the State \\nof Nevada is too broke to help people like me. \\n \\nI also was told it would take three to five years to be seen by a judge in the State of Nevada \\nto be given disability.  I encountered this black hole due to my age.  Because I was not over \\n50, I was made to feel that I was not important and to just leave the state.  I feel that when \\nthese programs are implemented they all sound good on paper, but when you have these \\npeople who work for your government agencies, they do not follow the rules and they make \\nevery effort to push us out.  I think better training needs to be involved, but also the fact that \\nI was discriminated against because of my age. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nWe are limited to two minutes, and it seems as though your comments would be better suited \\nfor public comment at the end of this hearing.  I see you are trying to tie your situation into \\nthis bill, and I appreciate that, but if you would like to wait on the call or call back at the end \\nof the meeting, there is a time for public comment as well. \\n \\nBrandy Novicka: \\nOkay, thank you. \\n \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 22, 2021 \\nPage 7 \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nIs there anyone else on the line in support?  [There was no one.]  One of the comments from \\nthe representative from AARP Nevada led to additional follow-up questions. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Titus: \\nThe gentleman who testified in favor of this bill from AARP sparked a question concerning \\nexpanding the eligibility for these programs.  Does the Division have any idea how many \\nmore folks will now be able to qualify for this or what any potential costs might be?  If you \\nare not prepared to answer now, perhaps you could bring that information back to us.  I think \\nit is relevant to the conversation on the impact of this bill.  It is not just cleanup language, \\nthere is a potential impact, and it may expand the number of folks who would now qualify for \\nthese services.  I am curious how many that might be. \\n \\nRique Robb: \\nWe will have to get that information for you and report back to the Committee. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Titus: \\nWe are expanding this and not just changing language.  There may be some important costs \\nto this.  Not that they are not justified; we simply need to look at the whole picture when we \\naddress this and what this policy would do to the state. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \\nI want to make sure I understand the intent of this—such as most of the stricken language \\nI see here.  The Fund for a Healthy Nevada is a finite fund.  There is a grant approval \\ncommittee that will look at applications, there is a community-based needs assessment plan, \\nand the grants are matched up to that.  Does this language change allow for new grantees to \\napply for dollars that we have not seen before?  I was thinking that is probably the opening \\nwe are looking for.  Is there something new happening that we have not been able to get to \\nand we want to make sure they can be defined into just applying?  Not that they would \\nnecessarily get the grant, but they could apply.  Is that right? \\n \\nRique Robb:  \\nNo, this is a program that is already receiving funding within the Aging and Disability \\nServices Division.  This is not asking for additional or new Fund for a Healthy Nevada funds \\nto grant out.  This is a current program.  We want to have the language available and have it \\nmore fluid to where we can actually provide services to the groups we have.  The change \\nAssemblywoman Titus was referencing is the change in the age from 62 to 60, and that is \\nwhat we would be researching—if there were additional persons who would qualify due to \\nthe fluidity of the program, then we would be able to monitor that closely. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nI know we had some technical difficulties with one of our callers in support, but is there \\nanyone else in support of this bill online? \\n \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 22, 2021 \\nPage 8 \\n \\nMarlene Lockard, representing Retired Public Employees of Nevada: \\nWe are in support of the bill and appreciate the opportunity to testify. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nAre there any callers in opposition to A.B. 35?  [There was no one.]  Do we have any callers \\nin neutral?  \\n \\nSteven Cohen, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \\nI would like to echo some of the previous testimony that will be reintroduced during public \\ncomment.  I will soon be subject to Medicare.  It has been not quite as bad a nightmare, but \\nas some Committee members know, dealing with insurance companies is never fun.  I will let \\nmy full remarks be heard during public comment.  I would be happy to work with the agency \\nand your Committee to meet in the middle. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nThank you, Mr. Cohen.  If you want to wait on the line until public comment, that would be \\nmore appropriate unless you have any direct comments in neutral for this bill.  At this time, \\nI will turn it back over to the bill presenters.  Do you have any closing statements? \\n \\nRique Robb: \\nI just want to thank you for the opportunity to present A.B. 35 and we look forward to \\nworking with you all through this process. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nIf Committee members have any follow-up questions after the close of this hearing today, \\nplease reach out to the Department of Health and Human Services and our presenters.  I am \\nsure they would be more than happy to further explain their intent or answer any detailed \\nquestions you might have.  With that, I will close the hearing on A.B. 35 and open the \\nhearing on Assembly Bill 119.  I believe Committee staff sent out documentation from the \\n2019 Session that created the Maternal Mortality Review Committee.  Hopefully, everyone \\nhas had an opportunity to review that.  Now, I will turn this over to Assemblywoman \\nThomas. \\n \\nAssembly  Bill  119:    Revises  provisions  relating  to  the  Maternal  Mortality  Review \\nCommittee. (BDR 40-740) \\n \\nAssemblywoman Clara Thomas, Assembly District No. 17: \\nI  am  introducing  Assembly  Bill  119  which  revises  provisions  relating  to  the  Maternal \\nMortality Review Committee.  With me today is my daughter, Edina Flaathen, who will \\nshare her personal story later. \\n \\nBefore I begin, I would like to point out two exhibits, which you can find on the Nevada \\nElectronic Legislative Information System.  First, you will find a link to a Centers for \\nDisease  Control  and  Prevention  (CDC)  report  on  racial/ethnic  disparities  in  pregnancy-\\nrelated deaths [Exhibit D].  Please take a look at the tables on pages 763-764. \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 22, 2021 \\nPage 9 \\n \\nAdditionally, Kyra Morgan, State Biostatistician from the Department of Health and Human \\nServices (DHHS), submitted an exhibit with additional information on disparate impacts of \\nmaternal morbidity and maternal mortality on people of color [Exhibit E].  Both Ms. Morgan \\nand her colleague, Vickie Ives, Section Manager of Maternal, Child and Adolescent Health at \\nDHHS, will be available to respond to any questions later. \\n \\nIn 2019, the Nevada Legislature clearly recognized unnecessarily high rates of maternal \\nmortality in the state when it established the Maternal Mortality Review Committee, in short, \\nMMRC.  At the time, Nevada was one of only a handful of states without an MMRC.  These \\ncommittees identify and review maternal mortality—a maternal death that happens within \\none  year  of  pregnancy—as  well  as  trends  in  severe  maternal  morbidity,  or  significant \\ncomplications that arise from a birth but do not lead to death.  Based on these reviews, the \\nMMRC  is  tasked  with  developing  recommendations  to  prevent  maternal  mortality  and \\nmorbidity and disseminating them to health care providers and the public. \\n \\nNot much has changed since 2019.  Maternal mortality rates remain high in the United States \\nand Nevada.  Nationwide, an estimated 700 women die of pregnancy-related causes each \\nyear, and 65,000 women experience serious health complications—rates nearly double those \\nof other industrialized countries.  Today, I bring A.B. 119 before you to acknowledge and \\nbegin to address a significant issue that is also deeply personal:  racial and ethnic disparities \\nin maternal and infant mortality.  While Black women make up 11 percent of Nevada\\'s \\npopulation,  they  account  for  33  percent  of  pregnancy-related  deaths.    Native-American \\nwomen represent just over 2 percent of the state population and account for 22 percent of \\npregnancy-related deaths.  Rates of severe maternal morbidity among Black, Asian-Pacific- \\nIslander, and Native-American women are similarly stark, at twice the rate of white women.   \\n \\nSimilar disparities exist for infants of color.  Black infants and Native Hawaiian/Pacific- \\nIslander infants are more than twice as likely to die as white or Hispanic infants.  Infant \\nmortality rates for Native-American and Native-Alaskan infants are not far behind. \\n \\nAssembly Bill 119 aims to address this unacceptable reality by requiring the MMRC to \\ncollect data to quantify and measure disparities in the incidence of maternal mortality and \\npreventable infant deaths affecting people of color in Nevada, and it requires a summary of \\nthis data to be included in the MMRC\\'s biennial report. \\n \\nIt is my hope in proposing this bill that the MMRC collects the data it needs to take a deeper \\nlook  at  these  very  real  issues  and  provide  concrete  policy  recommendations  to  reduce \\ndisparities that we can implement to protect and improve the lives of Nevadans. \\n \\nI do not have any amendments to present to you today, but I am working with stakeholders \\nfor a possible amendment to the bill.  I will make sure to share any possible amendments \\nwith you prior to a work session.  Now, I would like to hand it over to my daughter, Edina, \\nwho will share some personal experiences regarding this topic. \\n \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 22, 2021 \\nPage 10 \\n \\nEdina Flaathen, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \\nI am 36 years old, a wife, and mother of four.  In 2008, my husband and I were very happy to \\nfind we were expecting a baby girl.  I went through much of my pregnancy with prenatal care \\nand joyfully prepping for our daughter\\'s arrival.  I had been ill most of the time but would \\njust chalk it up to morning sickness.  I started noticing a lot of swelling in my feet and ankles \\nand would always ask my obstetrician (OB) if this was normal.  He would brush it off and \\nsay that it was probably hereditary:  \"My mom got swollen when she was pregnant.  That is \\nwhy.\"  Those were his words.  That always seemed off to me because, as a new mom, I was \\nreading everything and it did not sound normal, but he was my OB and he went to medical \\nschool, so I just listened. \\n \\nIt was not until about two weeks before my due date that someone finally noticed something \\nwas wrong.  I was under the care of another nurse practitioner because mine had left to go on \\nvacation.  While seeing someone new worried me, she became one of my biggest blessings.  \\nWe asked if my swelling was normal and she automatically said no and ordered blood work \\nand a 24-hour urine test.  The next day I received a call that I had preeclampsia and I needed \\nto proceed to the hospital and start the process of delivery right away.   \\n \\nThey let me try as long as possible to deliver on my own, but ultimately my blood pressure \\nrose too high and our healthy baby girl was delivered via C-section.  If it had not been for the \\ncare and quick thinking of my new nurse practitioner, I would have been in grave danger, and \\nI was told that on many occasions. \\n \\nI went on to have another healthy baby with no complications in 2010 and what I thought \\nwas a perfect delivery, until I got pregnant with my third child in 2013.  We found out this \\none was a boy and were very excited.  Once again, I had been extremely sick, but other than \\nthat, all seemed well until an ultrasound revealed I had placenta previa.  As a precaution, \\nI was to be monitored every two weeks.  At 27 weeks, I suddenly heard a pop, which was \\nfollowed by a lot of pain.  My husband decided I needed to go to the hospital where lots of \\ntests were run and there was a lot of head-scratching, trying to figure out what was wrong.  \\nI started  early  labor,  but  they  were  able  to  control  that with  medication.    Early  in  the \\nmorning, my high-risk doctor had called to check on me.  She told the nurses that she was \\ngoing to come in because she was concerned that I had been bleeding internally.  Everything \\nafter that is a blur, but I was told that my uterus had ruptured due to a prior poor surgical \\nprocedure with my second child.  My operating room (OR) doctor was very angry and said it \\nwas a miracle that I had lived.  I had lost over two liters of blood and needed several \\ntransfusions, but ultimately, my baby boy was kept safe by my having placenta previa to \\nprotect him.  Other than an early delivery, he has grown into a very spunky child with no \\nsigns of developmental issues.  Due to the work of my OR doctors, I was able to get pregnant \\none last time, and I delivered another healthy baby girl who is now approaching her nine-\\nmonth mark.  I am thankful for the doctors who did not push my concerns aside and provided \\nproper care.  Thank you for your time and your willingness to listen to my story. \\n \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 22, 2021 \\nPage 11 \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nThank you for sharing your story.  Personal stories like this touch home and remind us why \\nwe are doing what we are doing here today.  Are there any further remarks or would you like \\nto take questions? \\n \\nAssemblywoman Thomas: \\nYes, I am ready to answer any questions Committee members may have. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \\nThis is such an important issue.  I worked for the March of Dimes for 15 years, and hearing \\nthis story gets my heart.  Would you be willing to do an amendment to add me onto this bill? \\n \\nAssemblywoman Thomas: \\nYes. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \\nI have a question in section 1 at lines 19 through 22 where the language talks about collecting \\ninformation on preventable infant deaths as well.  Will this morph into the fetal infant \\nmortality review as well and combine the two programs? \\n \\nAssemblywoman Thomas: \\nYes, that is what the bill would include.  I would like to turn this over to DHHS.  I believe \\nthey have some information that would clearly address your question. \\n \\nVickie  Ives,  Section  Manager,  Maternal,  Child  and  Adolescent  Health,  Division  of \\nPublic and Behavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services: \\nWe have one fetal infant mortality review committee in the state, and that is in Washoe \\nCounty.  There is no statewide fetal infant mortality review, but maternal mortality review \\ncommittees review the maternal mortality and then the fetal infant mortality reviews look at \\nthat as infant and fetal demise and how to prevent them.  In terms of a statewide fetal infant \\nmortality review, there is not one currently, just the Washoe County Health District one \\nspecifically for that county.  However, there is a network of child death reviews within the \\ndifferent counties and they do consider all child fatalities, including infants—which is birth \\nto one year—within their scope.  The Maternal Mortality Review Committee does not review \\ninfant deaths. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Thomas: \\nWhen I said there were amendments being worked on with stakeholders, that would also \\ninclude that information.  It is necessary to get both data, especially when we are losing \\nBlack and Brown and indigenous children along with their mothers.  So it is important for us \\nto get that data. \\n \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 22, 2021 \\nPage 12 \\n \\nAssemblywoman Gorelow: \\nThank you for that clarification.  I was curious if this was going to encompass both programs \\ninto one.  I was aware that there was a Fetal Infant Mortality Review (FIMR) in Washoe.  \\nBecause this language says adding in the preventable infant deaths as well, I was not sure if \\nyou were looking at establishing a FIMR statewide as well or if it would be encompassed \\nwithin the maternal review. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Thomas: \\nWe can look into that. \\n \\nAssemblyman Matthews: \\nI have a question regarding section 1, subsection 1, paragraph (c), subparagraph (2).  How \\nwould the term \"persons of color\" be defined for the purposes of this bill? \\n \\nAssemblywoman Thomas: \\nIt is incumbent upon us to clarify that we are looking specifically for the terminology of \\nBlack women and Brown women and indigenous women.  For so long we have encountered \\nthe term \"women of color\" and we want to specify those women of color. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nMs. O\\'Krent, do you know if there is a definition that defines that in statute or common or \\ncase law? \\n \\nKarly O\\'Krent, Committee Counsel: \\nThere is not a definition of \"persons of color\" with regard to Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) \\nChapter 442 that I am aware of.  Often, we refer to Black, indigenous, and people of color \\nthroughout the NRS, so I am happy to add a definition if that is something the Committee \\nwould be interested in doing when we craft an amendment for this bill. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Peters: \\nIn that same section, is there an available definition for \"preventable infant deaths\"? \\n \\nKarly O\\'Krent: \\nThere is not an available definition for \"preventable infant deaths.\"  If it is the pleasure of the \\nCommittee, that could be fleshed out further so that whoever is examining preventable infant \\ndeaths would be able to identify what might fall under that category.  For example, is it an \\ninfant death that is somehow associated with the maternal mortality itself, or is it an infant \\ndeath that is unrelated to the death of the mother of the child? \\n \\nAssemblywoman Krasner: \\nThank you, Assemblywoman Thomas, for bringing this bill.  I was wondering if I, too, could \\nplease be added as a cosponsor of this legislation. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Thomas: \\nYes, I appreciate that. \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 22, 2021 \\nPage 13 \\n \\nAssemblywoman Titus: \\nI am a proud supporter of this bill and was happy to sign on when asked because I think it \\nfalls right in line with our push to make sure we can fix any disparities in health care in the \\nstate that we can.  How can we fix them if we do not know where they are or where they \\nstart?     \\n \\nMy question concerns clarifying section 1, subsection 2.  As Assemblywoman Peters asked, \\nI, too, would like to see somewhere in writing the \"preventable infant deaths\" defined, \\nwhether it is a therapeutic abortion someone has that might be preventable—if something \\nwas born at 27 weeks, it is certainly a viable child born alive and we were able to save that \\nchild—maybe we do not want to get into the weeds on this, but I think we need some \\nclarification on what is a \"preventable\" death.  If that baby dies intrauterine because you have \\npreeclampsia and then went into eclampsia, that is a preventable death.  However, we know \\nsome infants have health issues.  We know that about one-third of all pregnancies end up in a \\nmiscarriage because those infants were not viable.  So I think if we could tease some of that \\nout.  Maybe it is impossible, and we will have to leave it the way it is, but I would appreciate \\ngiving some thought to that.  This is really about where Assemblywoman Peters was going \\nwith it and having a definition on what is a \"preventable infant death\" for some clarity, \\nbecause there could be arguments on both sides.  We want this bill to go forward, so I would \\nlike to make sure we have that clarified. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Peters: \\nI have a follow-up comment.  I do not want to belabor the point, but we really appreciate this \\nbill.  I think it is one of the most important things we could be doing for women of color and \\nequity issues.  I want to ensure that as we look towards definitions and how we establish the \\ndata collection, that we are engaging physicians who focus on communities of color and \\nensure that we are defining these particular issues as they relate to the community that we are \\nspecifically addressing in this bill. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \\nWill you put on the legislative record the specific data that you would hope to collect?  The \\nCommittee has the power to subpoena and it is able to—is designed to—look at this in a \\nclinical way, subject to the purview of the open meeting law, and there is confidentiality \\nsurrounding that.  Knowing that, there are lots of protections around making sure that this \\ndata does stay in a clinical purview.  For the legislative record, as the Committee moves \\nforward, what would be your hope for the additional types of data you would either like to \\ncollect or see teased out? \\n \\nAssemblywoman Thomas: \\nI wish I could answer that.  We are set to have a meeting this week with the stakeholders to \\ngo  over information  that  will  be pertinent to  this  bill  and  any  amendments  to  it.   So, \\nunfortunately, I am not able to answer your question directly. \\n \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 22, 2021 \\nPage 14 \\n \\nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \\nThat is great because we know that oftentimes—and this concerns legislative intent—if we \\nare not talking with stakeholders, our legislative intent may not match up.  What we think is \\nreally easy to get, stakeholders just look at us cross-eyed.  I think it is wonderful, and I guess \\nwe will see that language come down the road. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nAre  there  further  questions  from  the  Committee?    [There  were  none.]    I  know \\nAssemblywoman Thomas is continuing to work on this. We all probably agree that we want \\nto get it right if we are going to pass this, and I know she will continue to work with those \\nstakeholders, taking into consideration some of the questions and comments here today.  \\nWith  that,  I  will  go  to  testimony  in  support,  opposition,  and  neutral,  beginning  with \\ntestimony in support.   \\n \\nKatie Robbins, representing Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada: \\nWe would like to voice our support for A.B. 119.  The United States has the highest maternal \\nmortality rate among similarly wealthy countries, with Black women having a maternal \\nmortality rate of double their white counterparts.  This statistic is unacceptable.  We applaud \\nthe Committee for taking steps to research and address these issues in Nevada so we can \\nmake childbirth a safer process for everyone, no matter your race or socioeconomic status.  \\nPlanned  Parenthood  Votes  Nevada  welcomes  these  changes  to  the  Maternal  Mortality \\nReview Committee and looks forward to working together to address the disparities in our \\nhealth care system. \\n \\nKelly Bumgarner, Director of Health Policy, Children\\'s Advocacy Alliance: \\nAs director of health policy at the Children\\'s Advocacy Alliance, on behalf of myself and \\nDr. Tara Raines, I would like to express support of A.B. 119.  The Maternal Mortality \\nReview Committee is a progressive step in promoting preventive care and healthy outcomes \\nfor  all  birthing  persons  and  babies  in  Nevada.    Unfortunately, their most  recent  report \\nindicated vast room for improvement.  The recommendations were narrow and did not \\nprovide resources for action and programming.  Assembly Bill 119 could improve reporting \\nby  tracking  morbidity  and  disparities  by  race,  which  would  enable  more  robust \\nrecommendations to guide preventive services.   \\n \\nAs advocates and data scientists, we also encourage reporting economic and geographic \\ndisparities.  This would allow our state to allocate preventive programs and interventions to \\nareas  of  greatest  need.    We  hope  the  Committee  supports  all  efforts  by  pertinent \\norganizations  to  secure  funding,  including  federal  Health  Resources  and  Services \\nAdministration grants, for innovation in maternal health.  Finally, we implore the Committee \\nto consider a variety of birthing models when addressing section 1, subsection 1, paragraph \\n(f), subparagraph (4).  Low intervention birthing approaches, including midwifery care and \\nthe use of doulas, have been shown to decrease morbidity and mortality in uncomplicated \\nbirths,  especially  for  Black  and  Brown  birthing  persons.    We  would  like  to  thank  the \\nCommittee for their diligence on this most important and difficult task. \\n \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 22, 2021 \\nPage 15 \\n \\nMarlene Lockard, representing Nevada Women\\'s Lobby: \\nWe are in support of A.B. 119.  We feel that collection of data is the key to discovery of \\nmany possibilities, responses, and solutions that may affect the mortality rate of women in \\nthis country and specifically in this state. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nIs there anyone else wishing to testify in support?  [There was no one.]  Is there anyone \\nwishing to testify in opposition?  [There was no one.]  Is there anyone neutral on A.B. 119?   \\n \\nArielle Edwards, Government Affairs Specialist, City of North Las Vegas: \\nI am actually in support, but I was having technical difficulties.  We would like to state for \\nthe record that we are proud to support A.B. 119.  We want to thank the bill\\'s sponsor for \\nbringing forward this important piece of legislation.  The city knows that the maternal \\nmortality rate showcases significant and wide disparities in maternal mortality and morbidity \\nespecially in Black and indigenous communities of color.  Therefore, we believe that this \\nCommittee is essential and an important effort in ensuring that the maternal mortality rate \\nshrinks in the state of Nevada. \\n \\n[The following caller misunderstood and waited for public comment to express support for \\nthe bill.  Chair Nguyen asked that her testimony be included here.] \\n \\nRobin Franklin, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \\nI want to express my full support for this bill.   My mother had an old saying that \"death \\ncircles a woman\\'s head 99 times.\"  Well, in this day and age, double it for a woman of color.  \\nA CDC study that took place between 2007 and 2016 found that a disproportionate amount \\nof women of color had higher mortality rates compared to that of white women.  I could tell \\nyou countless stories, but my story is frightening.  I am an African-American woman.  I was \\n28 years old, being induced, and because I was giving birth to a pretty big baby, I was high \\nrisk.  The medication administered to me that induced me repeatedly put my child in distress.  \\nIt was administered to me three times with the same result.  The hospital staff then broke my \\nwater, which ultimately gave me an infection.  Imagine the doctor coming to me and my \\nmother basically telling me that if I did not agree to an emergency C-section, that my mother \\nwould have to choose whom to save.  No grandparent should be faced with that decision.  \\nThis story is not uncommon, even if a situation is slightly different.  This could have ended \\ndifferently, but I was blessed to have a mother who advocated for me, and I left the hospital \\nalive.  Sadly, this did not happen for my sister-in-law, who lost her son due to her uterus \\nrupturing.   \\n \\nOversight  is  needed  to  address  this  issue—with  oversight,  data  is  collected  and \\nrecommendations are put forth.  True change can happen and save lives.  Women of color \\nshould not have to give their lives in order to bring forth life in this age of technology and \\neducation. \\n  \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 22, 2021 \\nPage 16 \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nIs there anyone in support, in opposition, or in neutral to A.B. 119?  [There was no one.]  \\nWould our sponsor like to make any closing remarks? \\n \\nAssemblywoman Thomas: \\nIn closing, A.B. 119 will ensure that the Maternal Mortality Review Committee has a clear \\nmandate to review any data concerning health disparities related to pregnancy and birth \\namong women of color in our state.  In doing so, we, the Legislature, may make policy \\nchanges that provide for better outcomes for our mothers and their children.  I urge you to \\nsupport this measure. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nWith that, I will close the hearing on A.B. 119. \\n \\n[Exhibit F was submitted but not discussed and will become part of the record.] \\n \\nNow we will move to public comment.  As a reminder to those providing public comment, \\nplease make sure to clearly state and spell your name and please limit your comments to two \\nminutes. \\n \\nSteven Cohen, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \\nI sent staff my longer remarks, and would be happy to address any questions about them \\noffline.   \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nThank  you  for  your  public  comment.    Any  written  documentation  or  public  comment \\nsubmitted in writing within 48 hours of the close of today\\'s hearing will be available on the \\nNevada Electronic Legislative Information System for you to view.  We will go to the next \\ncaller in public comment.  [Robin Franklin was the next caller.]  Madame Secretary, could \\nwe reclassify the testimony we heard just now?  It was not public comment; it was in support \\nof A.B. 119.  [The secretary agreed.] \\n \\nBrandy Novicka, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \\nI want to reiterate the importance of addressing disabled people who are under age 60, if not \\nunder the age of 40.  Due to my disability of spina bifida and lack of assistance in the state of \\nNevada, I was forced to move with my daughter, although she still has a father and family in \\nLas Vegas.  I think it is important that we address the issue that disabled people under the age \\nof 40 are being forgotten.  They are being told to simply leave the state. \\n \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 22, 2021 \\nPage 17 \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nDo we have any other people for public comment in the queue?

A statement reminding Committee members of Committee rules, protocol, \\nand how to participate in the meeting was made.]  We have one agenda item, a bill hearing, \\nand it has been on the Nevada Electronic Legislative Information System (NELIS) for people \\nto review.  I have allocated equal time for testimony in support, opposition, and neutral after \\nthe bill introduction.  I will now open the hearing for Assembly Bill 138.  Assemblywoman \\nMartinez is here to present this bill. \\n \\nAssembly Bill 138:  Revises provisions governing the eligibility of certain convicted \\npersons for public assistance. (BDR 38-760) \\n \\nAssemblywoman Susie Martinez, Assembly District No. 12: \\nI am introducing Assembly Bill 138 which revises provisions governing the eligibility of \\ncertain convicted persons for public assistance.   With me today is Shane Piccinini from the \\nFood Bank of Northern Nevada who will assist me with the presentation.  \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nAssemblywoman Martinez, I am sorry to interrupt you, but we are having some sound issues. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Martinez: \\nAssembly Bill 138 removes the requirement that a person who has been convicted of certain \\nfelony drug offenses complete a treatment program before becoming eligible for Temporary \\nAssistance for Needy Families (TANF) and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program \\n(SNAP) benefits.  Instead, the measure requires a person convicted of such an offense to \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 24, 2021 \\nPage 3 \\n \\ndemonstrate that he or she is not currently possessing, using, or distributing controlled \\nsubstances in a manner prohibited by law. \\n \\nHowever, I am proposing an amendment, which should be available on NELIS, that takes \\nthis policy one step further by eliminating the requirement that a person demonstrate to the \\nDivision  of  Welfare  and  Supportive  Services  (DWSS)  that  he  or  she  is  not  currently \\npossessing, using, or distributing controlled substances [Exhibit C]. \\n \\nFinally, I would like to add primary and cosponsors to the bill from both the Senate and the \\nAssembly.  The primary sponsors are Assemblywoman Benitez-Thompson, Assemblyman \\nYeager, Senator Cannizzaro, and Senator Ratti.  Cosponsors are Assemblywoman Anderson, \\nAssemblywoman Gorelow, Senator Spearman, and Senator Harris. \\n \\nI would now like to turn the presentation over to Shane Piccinini from the Food Bank of \\nNorthern Nevada.  He will provide additional information and background and answer any \\ntechnical questions you might have. \\n \\nShane Piccinini, Manager of Government Relations, Food Bank of Northern Nevada: \\nI have a quick presentation to walk through this [Exhibit D].  This prohibition on SNAP and \\nTANF benefits dates back to 1996 [page 2, Exhibit D].  The law created a lifetime ban for \\nindividuals with these types of convictions, many of whom were in a period of active \\naddiction when they attained their convictions [Exhibit E].  In 1996, what Congress did was \\nput a blanket ban on this for all 50 states, but it gave the states an option to opt out.  This bill \\nwould trigger the opt-out feature for Nevada.  Currently in Nevada when a felon is looking to \\nobtain benefits, that individual has to provide documentation.  Some of us have a hard time \\nkeeping track of our library cards, so anyone with a conviction after August 22, 1996, would \\nhave  to  provide  that  certificate.    As  there  has  been  time  and  history  to  evaluate  the \\neffectiveness of this bill, that has proven to be a really unreasonable prohibition on the \\nprogram. \\n \\nLet me give you an update on why it matters [page 3, Exhibit D].  In 2021, 30.8 percent of \\nNevadans are food-insecure.  Some of that has to do with the fact that Nevada never fully \\nrecovered from the recession of 2008, and some of that has to do with the fact that we are in \\nthe middle of a public health crisis.  Nevada\\'s children suffer the highest negative impact \\nunder the disqualifications under this current law.   \\n \\nThe number one food-insecure state in the Union also happens to be one of the states that \\nimplements the ban, and that is Mississippi.  On line with Florida, Tennessee, and Alabama, \\nthese states in the last year have all moved over to implement a partial ban, but the states that \\nhave some sort of ban are definitely some of the states with the highest food insecurity rates.  \\nNorth Carolina is the only state left in the Union with a full ban.  There are 25 states that \\nhave completely lifted the ban, which is what we are doing with this bill. \\n \\nWhat the bill accomplishes is pretty straightforward.  It removes the requirement to provide \\nany type of documentation for substance abuse treatment, and it removes one of the last \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 24, 2021 \\nPage 4 \\n \\nbarriers that anyone in Nevada would need to get food assistance.  People with substance \\nabuse convictions are the only ones who are prohibited from accessing these benefits.  No \\nother class of criminal conduct is prohibited under U.S. law or Nevada law. \\n \\nIn  2017,  one  of  the  biggest  reasons  we  decided  to  rethink  this  barrier  is  that  it \\ndisproportionately discriminates against minorities.  Black men are six times as likely to be \\nincarcerated as white men and Hispanic men are, and Hispanic men are 2.7 times as likely to \\nbe convicted as white men are.  For Black men in their thirties, about one in twelve is in \\nprison or in jail on any given day.  Women are now the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. \\npopulation who are being convicted for substance abuse offenses.  More than 61 percent of \\nwomen who are doing time in federal prison right now are in for nonviolent drug offenses.  \\nWomen,  and  particularly  women  of  color,  are  disproportionately  affected  by  the  social \\nstigma, by plea bargaining agreement systems that punish those who are unable or unwilling \\nto inform on others and by regulations that bar people with substance abuse convictions from \\nobtaining or that require a drug test to receive public assistance, and by a drug treatment \\nsystem designed for men.  Getting access to the drug counseling that is required in this law is \\nincredibly complicated.  Also, getting access to the appropriate drug test through the public \\ndefender  system  or  through  the  criminal  courts  is  incredibly  complicated.    Often,  the \\ndefendant would have to pay for that, which can be prohibitively expensive, depending upon \\nthe jurisdiction.  Black women are almost as likely, and Latinas are 20 percent more likely, to \\nbe incarcerated than white women.  Native American women are incarcerated at six times the \\nrate of their white counterparts, so this is incredibly discriminatory.  People who have an \\nupper middle class background have the opportunity to work with the criminal justice system \\nto get a different plea arrangement or to get a different conviction that people of color or \\npeople who are living below the poverty line just do not have.  There is absolutely no parity \\namong the convictions across the 50 states and in different jurisdictions that handle this \\nconviction, so that is a big motivator for us on why we want to rethink this. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nAre there questions? \\n \\nAssemblyman Matthews: \\nConcerning the amendment you discussed, if I understand you correctly, there would be \\nnothing in place, no requirements in place, for an individual to demonstrate that they have \\nceased  use,  possession,  or  distribution  in  order  to  gain  access  to  these  programs.    No \\nrequirements whatsoever.  Is that correct? \\n \\nShane Piccinini: \\nThere would be no requirements for them to get access to these benefits, correct. \\n \\nAssemblyman Matthews: \\nHypothetically, there could be someone who had been convicted and conceivably could still \\nin an ongoing way not only be perhaps using himself or herself, but actively distributing to \\nothers, perhaps even to minors, and would still not be barred from participation and access to \\nthese programs.  Am I correct about that as well? \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 24, 2021 \\nPage 5 \\n \\nShane Piccinini: \\nThat is correct, but what you are describing are matters that need to be addressed by the \\ncriminal justice system and not by the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services \\n(DHHS). \\n \\nAssemblyman Matthews: \\nHas any analysis been done on the extent to which this would increase eligibility for the \\nprogram in terms of numbers?  Do we have any data on how many people are currently \\nunable to access these programs because of the requirements who would now access them \\nunder this bill?  What might the fiscal impact of that be to the State? \\n \\nShane Piccinini: \\nThere are two answers to your question.  There is no impact to the State.  There are roughly \\n400,000 people currently enrolled into the SNAP program, but I cannot tell you the number \\nof people enrolled in TANF; however, it is a fairly low number.  Less than 4,000 people \\nbetween July 2019 through January of this year were denied because of their substance abuse \\nconvictions.  The harder number to get at is the number of people who may have been \\neligible through all the other qualifications that are in SNAP and TANF who did not apply \\nbecause they knew that they would be denied because of the ban.  There is just no way to \\nknow that. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Titus: \\nI want to thank you, Shane, and the Food Bank of Northern Nevada for all you are doing in \\nthis day of the pandemic and with food insecurity, and throughout the schools.  I have seen \\nthe excellent work you and your volunteers do to help with food insecurity.  This has been \\na tough time, so, thanks to you and all your workers for what you do. \\n \\nIn looking at section 1 of the bill, the proposal is to eliminate that a person has actually gone \\nthrough a treatment program, and I certainly understand the need to eliminate that.  In all the \\ncommittees I have been on—mental health, behavioral health, public health—and as a public \\nhealth officer, there are just not enough programs.  To demand that someone has completed \\nor entered a program, I absolutely support removing that, because I think that is a barrier.  \\nWhen you are asking them to do a program that they cannot possibly do, that is not a parity \\nin any way, so I am good with that.  I have not seen the amendment, but is there new wording \\nbeing added under section 1, subsection 2, paragraph (a)?  Currently, on the copy I have it \\nreads,  \"Demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Division that he or she is not currently \\npossessing, using or distributing controlled substances in a manner that is prohibited by law.\"  \\nAre you striking all of paragraph (a)?  Is that what the intent of the amendment is? \\n \\nAssemblywoman Martinez: \\nYes, we are striking it all. \\n \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 24, 2021 \\nPage 6 \\n \\nAssemblywoman Titus: \\nI think I heard that your argument to remove that language was because people could not get \\nin for drug testing and that there is a cost to that.  That is a true statement, but I do not see \\nthat the language on that line requires that you have drug testing.  I am interpreting this, and \\nmaybe we could get our legal counsel to chime in here.  That line just reads \"Demonstrates to \\nthe satisfaction of the Division . . .\" that they are not using.  That would be up to that office, \\nthe TANF folks and others who are involved in this, food distribution, et cetera, that they are \\nnot using.  Nowhere in this bill do I see that it required a drug test. \\n \\nShane Piccinini: \\nThe drug testing piece of that, and perhaps I muddied the waters, but that is something other \\nstates have used with similar language.  What we have done with the amendment is to \\nremove the language that suggests that, \"to the satisfaction of the Department,\" to say in the \\namendment that anybody with a substance abuse conviction could not be denied solely \\nbecause of that conviction. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Titus: \\nThat is not how I interpreted this.  That line would just require in good faith that they show \\nup sober or not impaired.  It is easy to demonstrate that, perhaps, just by showing up.  We \\nwould be one of five states that do not have any requirements or anything, I use the term \\n\"a carrot,\"  to  help  encourage  these  folks  to  continue  not  using,  so  there  would  be  no \\nrestrictions whatsoever in their application. \\n \\nShane Piccinini: \\nThere are currently 25 states that do not have a ban at all, that do not require any of this and \\nhave language very similar to what our amendment says. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Titus: \\nWhich is just eliminating any responsibility at all, correct?   \\n \\nShane Piccinini: \\nIt eliminates the requirement for a client applying for food stamps to address their prior \\ncriminal activity at all, correct. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Titus: \\nKeeping in there and if I might follow through on this chain, Madame Chair, because already \\nin the language is that a person could apply if that person were pregnant, regardless of any of \\nthe above language.  Again, because of the expectant mom and unborn child, we want to \\nmake sure those folks are taken care of, so there was never a ban on those entities being \\neither drug free or in a program.  We had that part still in statute, but what this amendment \\nwould do is totally eliminate any obligation, any restriction, any accessibility for the person \\nidentified as a felon.  Correct? \\n \\nShane Piccinini: \\nRight. \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 24, 2021 \\nPage 7 \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nWe do not have our legal counsel on this call.  They are busy drafting our bill draft request \\nnow, but I believe Ms. Swearingen from DWSS and someone from DHHS are on the line to \\nanswer any other questions.  I do not know if they have any input on Assemblywoman Titus\\'s \\nconcerns regarding that interpretation. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Titus: \\nI want clarity that there was never a mandatory drug test in that requirement.  The language \\ndid not say you had to have a drug test; it just had to be satisfactorily demonstrated.  That \\nwas all I wanted to clarify. \\n \\nShane Piccinini: \\nYes, you are correct.  There was never a mandatory drug test in there. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Peters: \\nI  am  looking  at  our  community  today  and  wondering  about  folks  who  had  a  felony \\nconviction from 1997, have been employed for the last 20-30 years, but were laid off because \\nof the pandemic.  They have to additionally prove that in 1997 they met the mandatory \\nrequirements—which in this are vague, so I imagine they are in regulations—to apply for \\nSNAP benefits today, 20 years after their conviction.  Is that correct? \\n \\nShane Piccinini: \\nYes, that is correct, and in Nevada, the requirement, as I recall, was a 30-day treatment \\nprogram accredited by the State.  There was a process they would follow to make sure that \\nthe rehab program met the standard. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Peters: \\nIf they were unemployed and applied for SNAP benefits but could not prove they had \\npreviously gone through that program in 1997 because the records were lost—possibly in \\na flood, which happened in 1997—they would have to go through an additional 30-day \\ntreatment program 20 years after their conviction to be eligible for SNAP benefits. \\n \\nShane Piccinini: \\nThat is correct, but the caveat to that would be that they may not be allowed into an \\nadditional program because they are no longer an active user.  As Assemblywoman Titus \\npointed out, there are simply not enough programs in Nevada to meet the current need. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Peters: \\nIn that 20-year time period, say they had three or four children and they were the sole \\nprovider for their family.  Would their children have access to that SNAP benefit until they \\nwere able to prove that? \\n \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 24, 2021 \\nPage 8 \\n \\nShane Piccinini: \\nThe children would still get access to SNAP [Exhibit F].  Our concern there is that you would \\nhave three people trying to use the benefit that was only for two, if it were a single mom with \\ntwo kids, which is generally the case. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Peters: \\nWith the original draft of this bill, in that scenario, what would they have to provide to \\ndemonstrate that they are not currently \"possessing, using or distributing\"?  Would they have \\nto open their house up for an inspection?  Would they have to pee in a cup?  What kind of \\nprocess would they have to go through to demonstrate that 20 years after their conviction, \\nafter three kids, that they were not using drugs or currently in possession of drugs in order to \\nestablish SNAP benefits? \\n \\nShane Piccinini: \\nThat is incredibly subjective, which is why the language is being removed from the bill.  It \\ncould change from one director of the Department of Health and Human Services to another \\nif it was done through the regulatory process.  As you can tell in the bill, it does not describe \\nwhat that looks like, so we are removing that language.  Making it as clean as possible was \\nthe best option. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Thomas: \\nI want to reiterate that the language in section 1, subsection 2, paragraph (a), \"Demonstrates \\nto the satisfaction of the Division,\" will be removed. \\n \\nShane Piccinini: \\nThat is correct.  In the amendment, that language is completely stricken from the bill. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \\nAssemblywoman Peters asked my question and covered it in some detail.  I am clear and \\nunderstand, and I appreciate the feedback. \\n \\nAssemblyman Hafen: \\nAssemblywoman Martinez, I apologize; this is the first time I have seen the amendment and \\nI am trying to understand the clarification of it.  In the bill that was presented to us, in \\naddition to those who were using and possessing drugs, there was a requirement for drug \\ndealers to demonstrate that they were no longer selling drugs.  Is it your intent to remove that \\nrequirement and allow drug dealers now to get these benefits? \\n \\nAssemblywoman Martinez: \\nThis was the category we had, anyone who had a drug offense.  To help them facilitate, they \\nhave already gone through the court system [unintelligible]. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nI think we have some sound issues with Assemblywoman Martinez.  Is there someone else \\nwho could reiterate? \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 24, 2021 \\nPage 9 \\n \\nShane Piccinini: \\nThe reason we also wanted to include the distribution part of that was because somebody \\ncould have been a distributor in 1997, and, as Assemblywoman Peters pointed out, had \\na clean track record for a number of years.  The person had done their time, was doing what \\nthey were supposed to be doing, so there was no reason to continue to hold this over their \\nhead.  Also, what was considered to be a distribution or possession charge in 1996 was \\nsubstantially different than it is today.  There is no easy way for us to determine what is or is \\nnot an appropriate charge.  All of this is taken care of through the criminal justice system.  \\nAgain, it makes no sense for the Department of Health and Human Services to be in that part \\nof the work. \\n \\nAssemblyman Hafen: \\nFor  clarification,  the  section  in  the  bill  being  stricken  by  the  amendment  that  says, \\n\"Demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Division . . . ,\" you are saying that it is difficult to \\nmake those determinations.  More government oversight, and you are trying to get rid of \\nsome of that.  Am I understanding that correctly? \\n \\nShane Piccinini: \\nWhat we are trying to do is eliminate a subjective part of the bill.  It may not be applied \\nevenly in the State of Nevada, administration over administration.  The cleaner this is, the \\nless administrative burden there is for the Department to try to figure out what that means \\nand to spend the time trying to track down 20-year old certificates.  Additionally, we want to \\nbring parity to the rest of this class of people to everybody else in the population.  This class \\nof people is the only one that is denied benefits under the regulations.  In order for this to \\nreally be clean, and to allow the Department to do the work that it needs to do, removing this \\nbarrier is just common sense. \\n \\nAssemblyman Matthews: \\nQuestions from the Committee covered the extreme ends of the possibilities here.  We talked \\nabout how this would allow those who are currently engaging in new use, distribution, \\nor possession to access the program.  Assemblywoman Peters brought up the other end of \\nthe spectrum that this would bar participation by those who perhaps had their conviction \\n20 years ago and perhaps lost the records showing they had gone through treatment.  In \\ncrafting this bill, was any thought given to addressing that time frame?  This is going to \\nbecome an arbitrary suggestion; I am not saying this is the magic number but, for the sake of \\nargument, a conviction more than five or six years into the past, perhaps the requirements in \\nthe pre-amended version might be waived.  If the conviction were more recent, then some \\nrequirements might make sense.  Was any thought given to that, and, if so, why was that \\napproach rejected? \\n \\nShane Piccinini: \\nYes, some thought has been given to that, and the research would also tell you that the people \\nwho are actively going through recovery are some of the most vulnerable populations there \\nare.  Ensuring that they have access to healthy food ensures a much greater success and \\ncompletion in their recovery than if that were not available to them. \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 24, 2021 \\nPage 10 \\n \\nAssemblyman Matthews: \\nAssemblywoman Peters introduced a hypothetical scenario, but the bill was crafted in a way \\nnot necessarily to target those but really with an eye toward those who were more recently \\nconvicted as opposed to those convicted in the past.  That was the focus of the bill—to really \\naddress not so much those whose convictions may have been decades in the past, but those \\nfor whom the conviction may have been more recent.  Would that be fair? \\n \\nShane Piccinini: \\nNot necessarily.  What we want to do is make it so the conviction, regardless of when it \\nhappened, was not relevant at all. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \\nIf a person is convicted of driving under the influence (DUI), or convicted of trafficking or \\nconvicted of murder, are they barred once they have served their time—whether they did the \\nshort end or the long end of conviction?  No matter how long ago they got out, are they \\nbarred from participating in any of these programs?  I think what I am hearing is that this is \\nstrictly about drugs and nothing else.  Am I wrong? \\n \\nShane Piccinini:      \\nYou are exactly right.  This only has to do with substance abuse.  A murder, white collar \\ncrime, DUI, there are no other classifications in the criminal code that would bar somebody \\nfrom these programs. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Summers-Armstrong: \\nThose other convictions have no requirements for them to do any type of prove up which was \\npart of this law.  Prove up that they are not trafficking, that they are not drinking if they had \\na DUI, or not participating in other criminal activities.  They are not required to prove up \\nanything in order to get benefits, only those people who have drug convictions.  Is that \\ncorrect? \\n \\nShane Piccinini: \\nThat is correct.  Any requirements that the court may impose on those individuals would not \\nprevent them from having access to SNAP or TANF. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Black: \\nThe language in this bill mentions being enrolled in or have completed a drug treatment \\nprogram, and then verify or somehow prove that you are not using an illegal substance.  \\nI thought we said earlier that there was no required drug testing, but how do people verify \\nthat they are not on drugs? \\n \\nShane Piccinini: \\nI  do  not  have  any  idea  how  that  would  work.    The  Department  would  have  to  write \\nregulations and figure that out. \\n \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 24, 2021 \\nPage 11 \\n \\nAssemblywoman Black: \\nThat is what it says right now. \\n \\nShane Piccinini: \\nThat language is being removed with our amendment. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Black: \\nThe bill as it was originally written says that you are required to either enroll in or have \\ncompleted  a  drug  treatment  program  and  you  are  required  to  prove  you  are  not  using \\na controlled substance.  Is that wrong? \\n \\nShane Piccinini: \\nThat is how the original bill was written, and that is why we offered the amendment.  It did \\nnot offer what we were trying to do, which was eliminate the need for the certificate at all.  \\nActually, that is not true.  What we were trying to do was make it so the conviction was not \\nrelevant at all toward being approved for benefits. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Black: \\nI am not worried about the conviction part of this.  Say someone comes in, they are actively \\nin a treatment program, or they have a certificate that says they completed one.  Then, they \\nare required to prove that they are not on a controlled substance.  How do they prove that? \\n \\nShane Piccinini: \\nIn some states other than Nevada, that led to drug testing.  Nevada has never had that, and it \\nis our position that Nevada should never adopt that as a policy.   \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nI believe Ms. Swearingen can answer your questions better.  Can you respond to what the \\nexisting law is? \\n \\nLisa Swearingen, Chief, Eligibility and Payments, Division of Welfare and Supportive \\nServices, Department of Health and Human Services: \\nCurrently the only thing we do when we have been notified that an individual has a felony \\ndrug  conviction  is  we  request  the  information  that  they  have  gone  through  a  SAPTA \\n[Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Agency]-approved program for drug-related \\noffenses.  We have no mechanism to monitor, track, and assure that they are not currently \\nusing.  This agency is not HIPAA [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act] \\ncompliant; I am not even sure we could request that information.  We cannot know medical \\ninformation or health information regarding individuals.  That is done on the Medicaid side.  \\nThat is a concern for us—how we would even monitor or implement that type of program. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Black: \\nMaybe it is just a statement that someone makes that says, \"I certify that I am not actively \\nusing drugs.\"  I do not think it is too much to ask someone to say, \"I am not using drugs,\" to \\nget welfare.  As someone who has had someone in-house, someone with an opioid problem \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 24, 2021 \\nPage 12 \\n \\nin their life, I think this is everyone\\'s problem.  I want every possible step along the way for \\nthere to be, as Assemblywoman Titus said, a \"carrot\" that incentivizes these folks to get into \\nsome sort of treatment program.  I can also understand the idea as Assemblyman Matthews \\nsaid, if you were charged thirty years ago, we probably should not still be penalizing you, but \\nI feel as though we are throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  Millions of people every \\nyear are getting on opioids or other substances.  What about those people?  I feel as though \\nthat was the intent of this bill, not to penalize people from 30 years ago, but to help \\nincentivize people who are getting on opioids today or selling drugs today.  I understand that \\nif we push them too hard and make it too hard to get support, that that almost pushes them \\nfarther down that rabbit hole, but we need some sort of middle ground.  Basically, you are \\ntaking every single thing off the table here and just saying, do drugs, sell drugs, whatever you \\nwant, not our problem, here is your assistance.  As someone with an opioid user in my life, \\nthat is a problem for me. \\n \\nAssemblywoman Benitez-Thompson: \\nI  appreciate  what  Assemblywoman  Titus,  Assemblywoman  Black,  and  Assemblyman \\nMatthews put on the record, but I think that in this bigger conversation we are having about \\nhow opioids affect our communities and about how we jail and sentence people, we are \\nalways trying to find the right dynamic.  I sponsored this legislation two years ago, and I still \\nthink it is meaningful and important.  I appreciate Assemblywoman Martinez bringing it \\nforward, because allowing this group of people access to TANF programs is exactly what \\nought to happen.  Within that program there are work requirements, there is a personal \\nresponsibility plan that you have to put together, there are programs to prevent and reduce \\nout-of-wedlock pregnancies.  There are lots of things happening within the TANF program \\nthat, if folks have access to it, they would be able to have more state services support and \\nmore of those kinds of \"carrots\" as you would say. \\n \\nThe same way we talk about \"housing first\" for our homeless population, we have to talk \\nabout \"feeding first\" for this population.  First and foremost, we have to make sure you are \\nfed, and then we are going to address your addiction.  We are going to address your addiction \\nby giving you access to programs like TANF, but first we are going to start you off with \\nSNAP if you qualify.  I think it is the right thing to do.  I think it makes a lot of sense.   \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nWith that, I will open up the lines for testimony in support, opposition, and neutral on \\nA.B. 138.  I will remind people on the line to clearly state and spell your name for the record.  \\nWe  will  be  limiting  testimony  to  two  minutes  to  ensure  that  everyone  is  given  a  fair \\nopportunity to speak.  Please begin testimony in support. \\n \\nJodi  Hocking,  Founder,  Return  Strong:  Families  United  for  Justice  for  the \\nIncarcerated: \\nWe are an organization of over 1,000 members who are either incarcerated, on parole, \\nprobation, or have loved ones who are incarcerated.  We want to recognize the value of this \\nbill for Nevadans.  This bill will help to reduce barriers to services for both men and women, \\nbut  I  want  to  make  special  note  of  women  in  my  statement  today.    According  to  the \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 24, 2021 \\nPage 13 \\n \\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union, between 2008 and 2018, the number of women in Nevada \\nprisons grew by 24 percent, 60 percent of those women are serving time for nonviolent \\ncrimes, and one in six are in for drug felonies.  Half of them also have documented mental \\nhealth issues.  The majority of these women are connected to families and children who have \\nhad to step up and survive without them.  They have children and responsibilities, and the \\ntransition home is difficult enough without continuing to create barriers for success and \\nincreasing the chance that people with their backs against the wall will make a decision that \\nleads them back to prison.   \\n \\nIf one in six women has a drug felony offense, they cannot get food stamps if they need \\nthem.  They are probably also struggling to get a job with a living wage and to find housing.  \\nWe need to create communities that allow people a fighting chance to stay free, stay clean \\nand sober, rebuild their lives, and stop chaining them to their past.  Food is a basic human \\nnecessity, and no one should be barred from any system in place to meet that need regardless \\nof their criminal history, especially in regard to people who are battling addiction.  We are \\nnot only punishing them but their children who quickly become secondarily impacted.  We \\nare in support of A.B. 138.  Just because in 1996 the Personal Responsibility and Work \\nOpportunity  Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) was widely implemented and attempted to \\nlegalize values, it also has been known to have been destructive to families and communities \\nand, specifically, Black, Brown, and poor communities.  It was directly tied to a system of \\nmass incarceration.  We support this bill and will continue to support this bill; but looking at \\n1996, and not accounting for the changes and the acknowledgement from the government \\nthat the war on drugs was a bad move, the Personal Responsibility Act was a bad move.  We \\ndestroyed communities and it needs to stop.  Nevada has to do better. \\n \\nSerena  Evans,  Policy  Specialist,  Nevada  Coalition  to  End  Domestic  and  Sexual \\nViolence: \\nThank you for bringing this bill forward.  We are in strong support of A.B. 138.  We know \\nthat having access to social services such as SNAP and TANF have positive impacts for \\nvictim survivors of violence and can be the key for them being able to leave and end an \\nabusive relationship.  Without these social service programs that allow victim survivors to \\ncare for their children and provide stability, they are more likely to stay in an abusive \\nrelationship and endure the violence.  We also know that having access to social services has \\nbeen shown to be an effective tool in reducing risk factors for future violence.  As with any \\ncommunity, victim survivors of violence can have convictions of drug violence, and they are \\njust as deserving of social support.  We are so appreciative of this measure to reduce barriers \\nin accessing SNAP and TANF benefits.  Everybody deserves access to food, and everybody \\ndeserves access to these truly lifesaving programs. \\n \\nNick Shepack, Program and Policy Associate, ACLU of Nevada: \\nThis bill, with the proposed amendment, seeks to remedy failed War on Drugs policy.  \\nWithholding access to food from people who have behavioral health issues is as bad and \\nineffective at addressing the issue of substance abuse as it is morally bankrupt as a policy.  \\nThis law was created during the \"tough on crime\" period of the 1990s that has led to the mass \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 24, 2021 \\nPage 14 \\n \\nincarceration we now struggle with.  Let us be clear.  These laws were an attempt to punish \\ncommunities of color for experiencing behavioral health crises by taking away their food. \\n \\nI want to touch on the difficulty of actually getting somebody into treatment.  When I was \\na social  work  intern  with  the  Washoe  County  Public  Defender\\'s  Office,  part  of  my \\nresponsibility was getting people into treatment programs.  The facilities, more often than \\nnot, had no available beds.  The ones that did have beds had all kinds of restrictions such as \\nno violent criminal record, no sex-related criminal record, no category B felonies or above, et \\ncetera.  Or they were evangelical institutions which often did amazing work but do not \\nalways align with people\\'s beliefs.  Even with a dedicated team of social workers, working as \\nhard as they could to get people into treatment, people would languish in jail for weeks or \\nmonths while we searched for a placement.  We attempted to try different technologies such \\nas one called OpenBeds which would show us which facilities had space available.  Due to \\nthe long wait list and lack of availability, it almost always read that nothing was available.  \\nGetting into treatment is not as easy as you may think.  It is harder if you do not have any \\nmoney or insurance; it is harder if you have a criminal record; it is harder if you live in rural \\nareas; and it can feel impossible if you do not have somebody to help you, such as a social \\nworker.   \\n \\nIf the goal of the state is to get people into treatment programs, then you must increase \\naccess.  You must make the system easier to navigate.  What you should not do is continue to \\nstarve people whose behavioral health issues the state has decided to criminalize.  A felony \\ndrug record makes getting housing harder, it makes getting a job harder, and it currently \\nmakes getting a meal harder.  You can change this.  It is the right thing to do; it is the moral \\nthing to do; it is good, smart policy. \\n \\nDenise Bolanos, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \\nI would like to offer my testimony in support of A.B. 138.  I do not speak here today as the \\nwife of an incarcerated person but as an eligibility worker for public assistance benefits in the \\nstate of California and a resident of Nevada.  I have seen firsthand the difference this makes \\nin the lives of individuals and families.  When California lifted this restriction, families were \\nsuddenly able to receive the amount allotted for their household size and income levels \\nwithout having to exclude the person with a previous conviction.  Five people still need to eat \\nin that home that is only being aided for four people.  People who have just finished serving \\ntheir sentence should not have to face food insecurity on top of the other hurdles that people \\nface post-release.   \\n \\nIt seems like a small thing; however, it makes an already hard situation even harder by \\nsanctioning the  person with  the  conviction.   These  individuals  currently  excluded  from \\nreceiving benefits have already served a sentence for their crimes, so why do they continue to \\npay for it along with their children and spouses?  And why is it my place as an eligibility \\nworker to deny them these benefits based on a drug conviction?  It seems to me that if \\nindividuals  reoffend,  it  is  up  to  the  criminal  justice  system  to  hold  them  accountable.  \\nSuccessful reentry is the best way to reduce recidivism, and eliminating this restriction is \\na huge step in making reentry successful.  If people are put in a position where they have no \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 24, 2021 \\nPage 15 \\n \\nchoice but to fall back to a life of crime to feed themselves and their families, then we cannot \\nbe surprised when that happens. \\n \\nChristine Saunders, Policy Director, Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada: \\nWe are here in support of A.B. 138 as amended.  Ultimately, the current modified ban creates \\nthree specific challenges that negatively impact public health in our community.  It promotes \\nfood insecurity and malnutrition for a person with a felony drug conviction and their family.  \\nIt poses a barrier to reintegration into the community and has a disproportionate impact on \\npeople of color who were unjustly targeted in the war on drugs.  According to the Drug \\nPolicy Alliance, nearly 80 percent of the people in federal prison and almost 60 percent of \\npeople in state prison who are there for drug offenses are Black or Latino.   \\n \\nLimiting access to food for someone and their family is a cruel way to encourage treatment.  \\nA recent study by Clemson University found that food insecurity instead actually leads to an \\nincrease in crime rates.   By removing this antiquated and punitive restriction, we allow more \\nNevadans access to food assistance while working toward increasing equity and ending food \\ninsecurity in our state.  We urge you to support this bill. \\n \\nGillian Block, representing Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers: \\nI am speaking in support of A.B. 138.  The SNAP and TANF programs provide a critical \\nsafety  net  to  low-income  individuals.    Individuals  with  felony  convictions  already  face \\nsignificant barriers to their reentrance into society.  These barriers are particularly steep for \\npeople of color who are convicted of drug offenses at much higher rates than white people, \\nalthough studies have shown that actual drug usage is roughly the same.  The current law is \\na roadblock for people leaving the criminal justice system.  It promotes food insecurity and \\nnegatively affects the health and economic security of people with a drug-related felony \\nconviction and their families.  The ability to apply for nutrition and safety net benefits helps \\npeople get back on their feet.  By helping individuals to lead more stable lives, the SNAP and \\nTANF programs improve reentry outcomes and have a positive effect on the lives of people \\nwith  a  drug-related  felony  conviction  in  their  family.    For  these  reasons,  the  Nevada \\nCoalition of Legal Service Providers supports A.B. 138. \\n \\nAshanti Lewis, Advocacy Manager, Three Square Food Bank, Las Vegas, Nevada: \\nOur  service  area  encompasses  Clark,  Lincoln,  Nye,  and  Esmeralda  Counties  where  we \\ndistribute food to agency partners, commonly known as food pantries.  We have had the \\nopportunity to work alongside the Food Bank of Northern Nevada, our counterpart in the \\nFeeding America network, on A.B. 138 as amended and greatly support this bill. \\n \\nAs a food bank, we see firsthand the effects of food insecurity, which has been highlighted \\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic.  Food banks are well aware of the strength of SNAP \\nbenefits and how they provide a boost to the economy while freeing up much-needed money \\nfor families and individuals in need.  Statistically, one in five adults in Nevada and one in \\nthree children are facing food insecurity.  This is a tremendous mountain to overcome as \\na food bank, as it is Three Square\\'s mission to feed hungry people.  The Supplemental \\nNutrition Assistance Program helps to alleviate some of the need and dependency on our \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 24, 2021 \\nPage 16 \\n \\nfood banks, ultimately allowing us to serve more people.  From a public health perspective, \\nThree Square is concerned about any and all barriers to access to food.  We are well aware \\nthat individuals and families experiencing food insecurity face many issues such as securing \\naffordable housing and employment.  Food should not be one of these barriers as adequate \\nnutrition is vital in order to lead and sustain a healthy and productive life. \\n \\nFederal nutrition programs such as SNAP are the first line of defense against ending hunger.  \\nWe strongly believe Nevada must have every option available to improve food security and \\nbring tools to the state that ensure all Nevadans have equal access to federal nutrition \\nprograms to help them become food secure in a sustainable way. \\n  \\nAyanna Oglesby, Private Citizen, Reno, Nevada: \\nI am calling in support of A.B. 138.  I agree with some of the previous callers.  The food \\ninsecurity rate is astronomical, along with the education and incarceration in the state of \\nNevada.  However, we are here about felony drug offenses and their eligibilities. \\n \\nI am in agreement because housing and employment are already hard enough challenges for \\nthese people.  Getting food should not be.  The more restrictions implicated, it elevates \\npeople\\'s  desperation.    It  is  insensitive  to  be  categorizing  convicted  persons  with  drug \\noffenses.  I am a witness to police activity.  When the PRWORA was implicated in the \\n1990s, if you were within five feet of someone who had drugs, you went to jail.  Before, \\npossession was nine-tenths of the law.  If someone threw their drugs while running, all ten \\npeople went to jail.  How to validate someone who was charged and had to go through the \\ncourt system and is not aware or educated about how to seal their record or have the charges \\nremoved, to have to carry that stigma of being arrested but yet later on in the court system it \\nwas dismissed.  There are more people corrupt that are not convicted persons who easily, \\nwithout question, take advantage and abuse these same benefits.  To target one specific \\ngroup, when everyone\\'s stomach growls, it is unethical and inhumane.  When other countries \\nwithhold food, America goes right in and challenges and rises up against it, yet we are, in the \\nstate of Nevada, withholding food.  There are people who do things for drugs and have never \\nbeen arrested and yet they qualify.  There is no way of knowing who is abusing, but the \\npercentage of abusers are higher of non-convicted people than those who are convicted.  \\nWhat is the rate of food being stolen out of Walmart and Smith\\'s and Albertsons?  People \\nsteal food because they are hungry, and they have to provide. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nWill you wrap up your comments?  We are at two minutes. \\n \\nAyanna Oglesby: \\nWith that, I will say, we are Nevada strong, we are battle born, and we have a moral \\nobligation to help our brothers and sisters. \\n \\nAshley White, Private Citizen, Las Vegas, Nevada: \\nI am here in support of A.B. 138.  I believe that this would be a good bill to pass because it \\nwould help many families in numerous ways.  One of the biggest struggles in this state and \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 24, 2021 \\nPage 17 \\n \\nworldwide is the lack of food and access to it.  Some people make bad decisions, but they \\nshould not have to suffer and keep struggling.  Parents come home or are getting their \\nchildren back and are working on restarting their homes.  They are trying to keep a stable and \\nsafe home for their children that still would allow them to help feed their families.  Many \\nindividuals are struggling especially in times like what we are dealing with currently with \\nCOVID-19 and getting a job.  With no job or other income to purchase food to feed their \\nfamilies, they starve and struggle.  This can possibly cause mental issues to restart and send \\nthem back down the same path they are working to correct.  Instead of continuing this \\nvicious cycle, let us make the change to support them and help one less stress and worry and \\nkeep them from starving.   \\n \\nI know personally, if I did not have the benefit monthly of SNAP, my family would be \\nstarving, so I understand the importance of those benefits.  I have seen this happen with \\nnumerous people that were incarcerated and had this problem.  If they had this help and \\nsecurity, success would have been much easier for them and their families.  My uncle ran \\ninto this problem after his drug conviction.  He was rehabilitated during his incarceration, but \\nthey did not have records, so he was denied SNAP and did not have access to food.  He \\nended up in the hospital as a diabetic almost in a coma.  We almost lost him.  If he had that \\naccess available, that would never have happened.  I do support A.B. 138.   \\n \\nBenjamin Challinor, Policy Director, Faith in Action Nevada: \\nWe are a statewide, nonpartisan, multifaith organization that organizes and advocates for \\nracial, social, and economic justice as well as inclusive democracy.  We are 100 percent in \\nsupport of A.B. 138 with the proposed amendment.  We want to thank Assemblywoman \\nMartinez for bringing this bill to the Committee.  We echo the sentiments of the previous \\nspeakers.  We must always strive to help those who are needy.  Nevada has never fully \\nrecovered from the 2008 recession due to the continued high number of Nevadans who \\nare experiencing food insecurity.  As we are currently in another economic crisis due to \\nCOVID-19, we are seeing more and more Nevadans needing public assistance.  The bill \\nremoves unneeded barriers, barriers that are disproportionately affecting communities of \\ncolor.  This bill works towards helping those who are most in need. \\n \\nEdward Coleman, Chair, Nevada Democratic Black Caucus: \\nI am speaking in support of A.B. 138.  The process of reentry is a significant issue facing our \\ncorrectional system.  According to research, LaCrosse, et.al. noted in the U.S., approximately \\n600,000 individuals are released from prison each year.  Within three years of their release \\napproximately two-thirds are rearrested, and three-fourths are rearrested within five years.  \\nThis research indicated that the first year after release is critical, for 50 percent are rearrested \\ndue to lack of support.  They noted barriers these individuals faced after being released \\nimpact their success at reintegrating back into society.  Barriers to reentry such as not \\nreceiving proper social, economic, and mental health and substance abuse support negatively \\nimpacted individuals\\' ability to reenter society, and these stresses were particularly acute in \\nthe first year after being released.   \\n \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 24, 2021 \\nPage 18 \\n \\nOur prison system is punitive and focuses on containment and control of individuals instead \\nof providing routes to rehabilitation.  In her research, Niela Esperanza Flores noted there are \\nsocioeconomic  factors  which  affect  recidivism.    Specifically,  she  linked  a  lack  of \\nsocioeconomic support and access to opportunities to improve their lives outside of prison as \\nfactors affecting recidivism. \\n \\nFlores stated many are released only to find that they do not have the necessary support, \\nresources, or financial means to be able to survive out in the real world.  Lack of access \\nto ways to support themselves after prison makes an individual more likely to resort to crime \\nto have their needs met.  Our prison system is punitive and lacks the socioeconomic support \\nfor certain convicted persons outside of prison.  This increases the chances they will reoffend \\nto  feed  and  shelter  themselves.    Some  may  argue  that  prison  itself  is  enough  to  deter \\nrecidivism.  Jennifer E. Copp explored it in her research and stated that the deterrence effect \\nof a prison-only system does not account for the socioeconomic realities that people face on \\nrelease.  Put another way, prison alone cannot reduce recidivism rates, and to be effective, \\nthere must be strong socioeconomic support for individuals who are released.  While some \\nmay argue that an individual\\'s behavior or characteristic dictates recidivism, the Prison \\nPolicy Institute has noted that the strongest predictor for recidivism is poverty—a lack of \\naccess to resources. \\n \\nAccording  to  the  Nevada  Department  of  Corrections,  the  three-year  recidivism  rate  in \\nNevada is 28.63 percent.  Due to injustices in the justice and social systems of the state, \\nBlack people are approximately 8 percent of the state\\'s population but account for 29 percent \\nof those incarcerated.   \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nExcuse me, can I get you to wrap up your comments. \\n \\nEdward Coleman: \\nLife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness:  In 2019, the voting rights of approximately \\n77,000 felons were restored.  These individuals have been given liberty and in a small way \\n[allotted time was exceeded]. \\n \\nJim Hoffman, representing Nevada Attorneys for Criminal Justice: \\nWe are here in support of this bill because it is positive for our clients for all the reasons you \\nhave already heard.  Rather than repeat what they said, I will share a personal anecdote.  \\nWhen I was a kid, my family was on food stamps.  It is very difficult being hungry—on \\na physiological level.  If you do not get enough to eat, that is all you can think about.  You \\ncan only concentrate on getting enough to eat, and it is hard to concentrate on other things.  \\nFor people who have gotten out of prison, who have gotten off of drugs, who are trying to put \\ntheir lives back together and maintain their stability, it is really hard when you cannot \\nconcentrate.  That makes it harder for them to stay on the straight and narrow path, and that is \\nsomething we want as a society.  In order to support that policy, I think it makes the most \\nsense to let these people have food stamps.   \\n \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 24, 2021 \\nPage 19 \\n \\nNicole Williams, Private Citizen, Dayton, Nevada: \\nI  am  in  full  support  of  A.B.  138.    All  humans,  all  Nevadans,  with  or  without  felony \\nconvictions, should have access to food.  It is basic human decency to ensure nobody goes \\nhungry.  Convicted felons already struggle with reentry to society, and not having to worry \\nabout food is one less obstacle. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nAre there more callers in support?  [There were none.]  We are at 27 minutes of testimony in \\ntotal support, so I will open the lines for 28 minutes of testimony in opposition.  [There was \\nno one to speak in opposition.]  With that, we will go to testimony in neutral, and I will allow \\nthe same amount of time for neutral testimony as well. \\n \\nLisa Swearingen: \\nThe  Division  would  like  to  thank  Assemblywoman  Martinez  and  Shane  Piccinini  for \\nbringing this bill with the amended language forward.  We look forward to working with the \\nbill\\'s sponsors in addressing any additional questions or concerns that might arise. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nDo you have any closing remarks, Assemblywoman Martinez? \\n \\nAssemblywoman Martinez: \\nI want to reiterate that A.B. 138 will allow people, regardless of past drug convictions, to \\napply for these critical public assistance programs.  We are currently living in unprecedented \\ntimes with COVID-19.  This bill will help so many Nevadans, and that is what we are here \\nfor—to help families.  I urge you to support A.B. 138, and I thank the Committee, Shane \\nPiccinini, and all the callers who called in support. \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nI will close the hearing on A.B. 138. \\n \\n[Exhibit G, Exhibit H, Exhibit I, Exhibit J, and Exhibit K were submitted but not discussed \\nand will become part of the record.] \\n \\nI will now begin with public comment.  [The Chair reiterated Committee rules regarding \\npublic comment.]  Is there anyone on the line for public comment?   \\n \\nJodi Hocking: \\nI want to let you know that someone who registered has been trying to give testimony on the \\nsupport side.  The last three digits of her number are 099.  She is in the waiting room, but she \\nhas not been called, and she keeps trying to get in.   \\n \\n   \\nAssembly Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 24, 2021 \\nPage 20 \\n \\nChair Nguyen: \\nIs there anyone in the waiting room with those last three digits of her phone number?  \\n[Someone was in the room who had not raised her hand and was unable to unmute.] \\n \\nI suggest that the person who was on the call put their comments in writing.  Support \\ntestimony can be submitted within 48 hours after the close of the meeting.  Additionally, \\nI know there are some tutorials.  I worked through the tutorial, as a lot of Assembly members \\ndid, to see how it worked to get on those calls.  If there are additional questions, I would \\nencourage that caller to reach out to my office directly, and maybe we can troubleshoot some \\nof the problems concerning why the individual could not be heard today over the phone.  Is \\nanyone else on the line for public comment?  [There was no one.] \\n \\nThat concludes our meeting for today.  Are there any comments from Committee members?  \\n[There was no response.]  Our next meeting will be on Monday, March 1.  Keep in mind that \\nwe will likely be having a work session on several bills we have heard over the last couple of \\nweeks.

(BDR 38-193) \\n \\nSENATOR JAMES A. SETTELMEYER (Senatorial District No. 17): \\nSenate Bill No. 446 of the 80th Session was brought before us and passed out \\nof committee but lost on the Senate Floor. This bill has two aspects. One is the \\nconcept of self-managed care, the other will be presented by Senator Hardy, \\ndealing with Medicaid termination for those incarcerated. \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 16, 2021 \\nPage 3 \\n \\nThis bill came about as I saw my friend Ted Nagel on the street, at night, in his \\nwheelchair headed for the hospital. As I spoke with him, I found out he was \\nunable to find individuals to care for him at his home at the rate made available \\nto them. This bill would allow Mr. Nagel to be in charge of his own care, called \\nself-managed care, as he has the wherewithal to do this. Self-managed care is \\nnot for everyone but for those who have the mental faculties to manage their \\nown care, giving them the opportunity to have those resources available at a \\nhigher level. \\n \\nThis would give those individuals making $10 an hour the ability to make up to \\nthe  federal  rate  offering  which  is  $25  to  $27.  The  personal  managed  care \\nconcept, after being reduced as it is within federal law, would give them the \\nability  to  be  paid,  perhaps,  $17  to  $21.  With  that  wage,  you  could  find \\nindividuals in today’s market willing to work, doing what is necessary to care \\nfor our disabled. \\n \\nTED NAGEL: \\nI support S.B. 93. This bill is important to my physical well-being and human \\nright to earn a living and enjoy life. During the last campaign cycle, many of the \\ncandidates  across  the  levels  of  government  made  points  about  the  Nation \\ngreatly lacking in personal caregivers. Several referred to it as a pandemic unto \\nitself, most attributing it to low wages.  \\n \\nI was born with a physical disability called Arthrogryposis. Although I am not \\nparalyzed  and  have  full  feeling,  my  physical  abilities  fit  the  description  of \\nsomeone who is paralyzed. I rely on the assistance of others to help me out of \\nbed, bathe, groom, prepare meals, etc. Without any or all of these basic needs \\ntaken care of, I would remain in bed unable to do anything for myself.  \\n \\nWith these needs met, I am able to function in society and operate my own \\nbusiness as a mobile DJ, entertaining for events such as weddings and funerals. \\nI do marketing for several business which, until the pandemic, kept me busy. As \\nI live in a rural area, it has been difficult to find caregivers willing to work for the \\nmeager  pay  offered  through  the  Medicaid-funded  personal  care  program.  At \\nbest, they would earn $10.50 an hour. For that amount of money, most people \\nwould rather work at a fast-food establishment than take care of someone’s \\npersonal hygiene. The few caregivers who do it well do not last working for \\nagencies making this wage when they could be making $20 to $25 an hour \\nworking under a private pay situation. \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 16, 2021 \\nPage 4 \\n \\nDue to my wife’s own physical limitations, she is unable to provide the care I \\nrequire. It became the practice of one care agency after another, as she lives in \\nthe home, to not send anyone out to provide care any time the agency had a \\nscheduling issue. As a result, on June 3, 2018, I resigned myself to check into \\na long-term care facility until the issue was resolved. I expected this to be one, \\nmaybe two months. Two months turned into 4 months, then a year, and to my \\ndispleasure, I remained in the facility for 30 months.  \\n \\nI returned home on December 3, 2020, as the coronavirus hit the facility and \\nten residents were diagnosed in one week with Covid-19. We were afraid I \\nwould catch the virus and pass away. Until I can get back on the Medicaid \\nprogram that once again will provide a caregiver, I am living at home under the \\ncare of my wife who still has her physical limitations to deal with.  \\n \\nTo  make  things  work,  I  stay  in  bed  every  other  day  to  allow  my  wife  to \\nrecuperate from helping me the day before. This is not a pleasant arrangement \\nfor either of us, but one that is necessary. This situation is not conducive to me \\nreturning to work, so we live solely on my monthly social security disability \\npayments. It is interesting that spouses, or other immediate family members \\nliving  in  the  home  providing  care,  cannot  be  reimbursed  through  Medicaid. \\nThese family members may have given up their careers in order to take care of \\ntheir family member.  \\n \\nI  want  you  to  understand  there  are  several  thousand  disabled  residents  in \\nNevada with similar stories of difficulty finding caregivers due to low wages and \\nlack of caregivers due to that low wage. As a member of the Nevada Disability \\nPrevention  Action  Coalition,  I  want  to  represent  those  who,  in  the  past  or \\ncurrently, suffer from lack of care.  \\n \\nSenate Bill 93, in part, provides an avenue for Nevada residents who have the \\ncognitive ability to manage their own finances, to pay a reasonable salary from \\nthe State directly to caregivers for their services up to the federally mandated \\nmaximum. Until now, no one was able to subsidize their caregivers pay to make \\nthe job more palatable and keep reasonable caregivers employed without getting \\nkicked off of the program. We need to move forward to a society that opens as \\nmany  opportunities  for  independence  as  possible.  It  took  many  years  for \\ndisabled folks to “come out of the disability closet.” Many are trying to hold \\ndown a job and rely on caregivers to make it out their front door to go to work. \\nLet us make that situation one less thing for them to worry about. \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 16, 2021 \\nPage 5 \\n \\nSENATOR SETTELMEYER: \\nThe first section of S.B. 93 represents self-managed care. An individual such as \\nMr. Nagel contacts an agency that takes a portion of the fund, and hires a \\ncaregiver, which reduces the funds available for the caregiver to $10 to $12 an \\nhour.  Sadly,  for  the  type  of  personal  care  Mr.  Nagel  and  most  individuals \\nrequire, there are not many willing to work for that wage. \\n \\nThere have been discussions on what a minimum wage should be. Paying below \\nthat number for these types of services makes it difficult to find caregivers. This \\nwould allow Mr. Nagel to handle his own self-managed care and be reimbursed \\nup to the federal fund amount to hire a caregiver. He would, in essence, become \\nthat person hired through the agency. This is not for everyone. There are those \\nwho do not have the wherewithal to do this such as Mr. Nagel does. Those that \\ndo should be given the opportunity to manage their own personal care and hire \\nassistance  accordingly,  using  up  to  the  federal  amount  allowed  to  pay \\ncaregivers.  \\n \\nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \\nThis would allow an individual to supplement the caregiver’s wages with his or \\nher own resources? \\n \\nSENATOR SETTELMEYER: \\nIt would allow individuals, such as Mr. Nagel, to hire a caregiver and pay $50 an \\nhour if they have the resources to afford the difference between their income \\nand the federal rate. Right now, they are forbidden by law from paying anything \\nover the federal rate. This bill would allow them the opportunity to hire someone \\nat a higher rate and make up the difference themselves. \\n \\nSENATOR JOSEPH P. HARDY (Senatorial District No. 12): \\nSection 3 of S.B. 93 represents Medicaid being terminated when an individual is \\nincarcerated. If it were to be suspended, it would be easier for the individual to \\nget  back  on  track  rather  than  if  it  were  terminated.  When  an  individual  is \\nincarcerated, he or she loses Medicaid coverage because the State assumes \\ncharge of the care of the individual, paying for medical services. Tradition is that \\nunless there is a waiver, the State terminates Medicaid and the individual has to \\nreapply when released from prison.  \\n \\nOne of the consistencies we find is it takes longer to have a new application for \\nMedicaid  completed  than  to  reinstate  if  it  has  been  suspended.  When  an \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 16, 2021 \\nPage 6 \\n \\nindividual is released, that person is vulnerable, has medical issues, substance \\nuse disorders, a longer wait to get approval for Medicaid to be reinstated and is \\nat risk for recidivism. \\n \\nSection 3 of S.B. 93 allows the State to suspend Medicaid, thus reinstating it in \\neffectiveness immediately upon release from prison. It is good for the prisoner \\nand good for the State as we save money. It helps with the challenges of \\nrecidivism, getting individuals safely back into society receiving the care they \\nneed while eligible for Medicaid. \\n \\nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \\nThe Division of Welfare and Supportive Services has a pilot program running in \\nour State correctional facilities to ensure individuals are enrolled in Medicaid \\neffective  upon  release  from  prison.  What  is  the  state  of  play  for  when \\nindividuals are in county jails awaiting adjudication? Are they in the same status \\nas State inmates at this point, and would this bill also capture them? \\n \\nSENATOR HARDY: \\nWhen in a halfway house, this waiver would be effective, so you would be \\neligible for Medicaid; however, I will defer to the experts to confirm this. \\n \\nLISA  SWEARINGEN  (Chief,  Eligibility  and  Payments,  Division  of  Welfare  and \\nSupportive Services, Department of Health and Human Services): \\nWe are running a pilot project with a couple of institutions in Las Vegas. We are \\nworking with enrolling these individuals as part of their prerelease package. We \\nhelp the inmate fill out the application to assume a suspend status so we are \\nnotified as soon as he or she is released and their cases made eligible. That \\nprocess takes from 24 to 48 hours to complete as we have to run through a \\nbatch process to the Medicaid agency. The inmate receives a Medicaid card \\nupon release.  \\n \\nWe do not have anything in place at this time in the county jails for suspending \\nthese individuals. We are looking at detention centers and recently signed a \\ncontract with the Public Consulting Group to obtain incarceration information to \\nget a better idea on when individuals become incarcerated so we can quickly \\nget them benefits once they are released.  \\n \\nWe have a process in place with the Department of Corrections for applications \\nsubmitted when individuals are incarcerated and leave the facility to go into the \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 16, 2021 \\nPage 7 \\n \\nhospital. If they are in the hospital over 24 hours, we are able to take those bills \\nand process them as a prior medical request, paying those bills under Medicaid. \\n \\nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \\nThe ability to create a suspended status would affect any Medicaid recipient, \\nregardless of which level of custody in county jail or State custody? \\n \\nMS. SWEARINGEN: \\nWe built a process in our system to suspend these individuals. It shows they are \\nsuspended; however, it sends the ineligible version to Medicaid so there are no \\ncapitation fees being charged to the State. The system allows us to reverse that \\nsuspension and reinstate those cases. There would be no fiscal note attached. \\n \\nSARAH K. HAWKINS (Nevada Attorneys for Criminal Justice): \\nI proposed an amendment to S.B. 93 (Exhibit B) that would have prohibited the \\ntermination of Medicaid benefits for incarcerated individuals. As written, it is \\ndiscretionary. I have been made aware of a significant fiscal note attached to \\nthe amendment that imperils the bill, so I am withdrawing the amendment. \\n \\nSTEVEN COHEN: \\nI support S.B. 93. \\n \\nDARIN BALAAM (Sheriff, Washoe County): \\nThe Washoe County Sheriff’s Office supports S.B. 93, particularly section 3. \\nSuspending Medicaid for incarcerated individuals, as opposed to terminating, \\nwill improve continuity of care and outcomes for individuals we serve in our \\ncorrection and detention facilities. \\n \\nSeveral years ago, the Washoe County Sheriff’s Office formed a partnership \\nwith the State, allowing us to help inmates incarcerated within the Washoe \\nCounty  Detention  Facility  apply  for  Medicaid  before  they  are  released.  Our \\nDetention Services Unit pulls a weekly report for inmates scheduled for release \\nwithin ten days. Inmates who have indicated they would like services or are \\neligible for Medicaid are screened and provided with applications; they fill those \\nout, and we forward them on to the State office.  \\n \\nAbout  6  to  15  Medicaid  and/or  Supplemental  Nutrition  Assistance  Program \\n(SNAP) applications a day are being sent from our office to the Division of \\nWelfare  and  Supportive  Services.  This  shows  how  many  inmates  in  our \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 16, 2021 \\nPage 8 \\n \\nDetention Facility in Washoe County need Medicaid or SNAP. Because of our \\npartnership with the State, we are able to notify these agencies two days prior \\nto an inmate’s release. At that point, applications are processed so by the time \\nthe inmate is released from our facility, Medicaid has been reinstated.  \\n \\nFor the many we serve, the program and services they want or need require \\ninsurance.  The  Washoe  County  Sheriff’s  Office  believes  the  responsibility  is \\nincumbent  upon  us  to  help  inmates  with  services  in  an  effort  to  reduce \\nrecidivism and get them on the road to recovery. The level of inmates requiring \\nmental  health  service,  whether  for  addiction  or  mental  illness,  continually \\nincreases. Providing Medicaid prior to release helps them keep continuity of care \\nupon release. Once they are released and not able to have Medicaid reinstated, \\nwe  have  seen  them  turn  to  other  types  of  illegal  substances  to  medicate \\nthemselves. This bill will help ensure the neediest among us will receive services \\nthrough Medicaid or SNAP.  \\n \\nOur  Detention  Services  Unit  works  diligently  to  find  services  and  beds  for \\ninmates prior to their release. This helps avoid delays in receiving Medicaid, \\ntherefore avoiding delays in receiving care to make an impact on outcomes and \\nrecidivism once released.  \\n \\nSERENA EVANS (Nevada Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual Violence): \\nThe Nevada Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual Violence supports S.B. 93, \\nparticularly section 3. We know many victim survivors are incarcerated for a \\nmultitude of reasons, many of which are directly impacted because of their \\nvictimization. For many survivors previously incarcerated, we consistently hear \\nthey are not getting access to affordable health care. It is a challenge and can \\nbe a barrier for overcoming previous victimization. We are in support of any \\nmeasures ensuring incarcerated individuals and victim survivors have access to \\naffordable healthcare upon their release so they can get back on track without \\nhaving the burden of reapplying for eligibility in the Medicaid program. \\n \\nJOANNA JACOB (Clark County): \\nClark County supports S.B. 93, particularly section 3. Last year, Clark County \\nand our city colleagues took part in a working group on efforts to address \\nhomelessness through the passage of A.B. No. 73 of the 80th Session. We had \\nnumerous presentations from law enforcement and jails in southern Nevada that \\ntalked  about  factors  driving  recidivism  which  had  to  do  with  the  concerns \\nidentified by Sheriff Balaam in Washoe County. Access to medication, support, \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 16, 2021 \\nPage 9 \\n \\nhousing and linking people to a system of care as quickly as possible after \\ndischarge  from  a  correctional  setting  is  important,  addressing  those  factors \\ndriving recidivism. We believe the suspension, as opposed to termination of \\nMedicaid, will help link those eligible into a system of care we know our State \\nhas worked hard to develop. The Division of Welfare and Supportive Services \\nhas  tried  to  partner  with  Clark  County  Detention  Center  to  bring  eligibility \\nservices into a detention center.  \\n \\nCONNIE MCMULLEN (Personal Care Association of Nevada): \\nThe Personal Care Association of Nevada stands neutral on S.B. 93. When the \\nbill was initially presented, I thought most of what the bill sponsor wanted was \\nalready in law. We are happy that section 2 is being clarified and placed into \\nlaw. Some of our members are concerned for vulnerable people being placed in \\na  situation  of  unlicensed  caregivers  and  the  attendant  oversight  of  those \\ncaregivers. The fact that Mr. Nagel, who is able to live in his community in a \\nless-restrictive setting, was forced to go into a nursing home was unnecessary. \\nWe remain neutral but are not opposed. \\n \\nERIC SPRATLEY (Executive Director, Nevada Sheriffs’ and Chiefs’ Association): \\nNevada Sheriffs’ and Chiefs’ Association supports S.B. 93. \\n \\nMS. HAWKINS: \\nWe know there are fiscal benefits to S.B. 93 that promises to reduce recidivism. \\nFor  my  clients,  once  individuals  are  stabilized  in  custody  on  mental  health \\nmedication,  we  are  looking  for  continuity  of  care  that  keeps  them  on  their \\nmedications, functioning well and being productive in the community with their \\nfamilies. Too often, I see where the interruption in eligibility benefits causes a \\nlapse in a person taking and having access to medication. I am in support of \\nS.B. 93. \\n \\nJOHN  PIRO  (Deputy  Public  Defender,  Office  of  the  Public  Defender, \\nClark County): \\nOffices of the Clark and Washoe County Public Defenders support S.B. 93. \\nSection 3 is the most important for continuity of care. There is nothing worse \\nthan getting a mentally ill client in custody stabilized on the correct medications \\nand then getting that person released without the proper medical coverage, \\nincreasing the risk of recidivism.  \\n \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 16, 2021 \\nPage 10 \\n \\nCHAIR RATTI: \\nI will close the hearing on S.B. 93. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRemainder of page intentionally left blank; signature page to follow.   \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 16, 2021 \\nPage 11 \\n \\nCHAIR RATTI: \\nAs there is no public comment, this meeting is adjourned at 4:56 p.m. \\n \\n \\nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\nVickie Polzien, \\nCommittee Secretary \\n \\n \\nAPPROVED BY: \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \\n \\n \\nDATE:     \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 16, 2021 \\nPage 12 \\n \\nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \\nExhibit  Begins \\nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \\nLetter  on Page \\n  A  1    Agenda \\nSarah K.

All exhibits are available and on file in the Research \\nLibrary of the Legislative Counsel Bureau. \\n \\nCOMMITTEE MEMBERS PRESENT: \\n \\nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \\nSenator Pat Spearman, Vice Chair \\nSenator Dallas Harris \\nSenator Joseph P. Hardy \\nSenator Ben Kieckhefer \\n \\nSTAFF MEMBERS PRESENT: \\n \\nMegan Comlossy, Policy Analyst \\nEric Robbins, Counsel \\nNorma Mallett, Committee Secretary \\n \\nCHAIR RATTI: \\nI will open the hearing on Senate Bill (S.B.) 123. \\n \\nSENATE  BILL  123:  Revises  provisions  relating  to  the  Nevada  Silver  Haired \\nLegislative Forum. (BDR 38-6) \\n \\nSENATOR PAT SPEARMAN (Senatorial District 1): \\nI am presenting S.B. 123 relating to the Nevada Silver Haired Legislative Forum. \\nI will provide you with background information about the Forum (Exhibit B) and \\nthe proposed conceptual amendments in this bill (Exhibit C). \\n \\nThe proposed changes to S.B. 123 expand the qualifications relating to the \\nmembership of the Forum. Section 1 of the bill provides flexibility to appoint \\nindividuals to the Forum by changing residency requirements from five years to \\none year for all nominees or six months for nominees who are military members.\\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 18, 2021 \\nPage 2 \\n \\nSection 1 also reduces the residency requirement in the Senatorial District from \\n3  years  to  30 days.  Section  2  of  the  bill  would  include  the  same  changes \\nregarding ex officio members of the Forum. \\n \\nSenate Bill 123 came about because I wanted to nominate a person to the \\nNevada  Silver  Haired  Legislative  Forum.  The  person  had  over  30  years  of \\nexperience in business and industry but had not been in Nevada for 3 years; she \\nwas told she could not serve. I could not understand why those qualifications \\nexisted. People who want to serve are over 60 years old, retired and want to \\ngive back to their community. I do not understand why we make them wait \\nfive years to qualify; it does not make sense. The residency requirements in the \\nproposed amendments mirror those for offices in Nevada.  \\n \\nSENATOR HARDY: \\nI have been involved with appointing people to the Forum for some time now. I \\nfind institutional knowledge has advantages for Nevada and what our State is \\ndoing. Losing institutional knowledge is bad. I wonder if the bill's sponsor would \\nbe  interested  in  limiting  the  number  of  Forum  members  who  do  not  have \\ninstitutional knowledge to no more than one-third under the six-month residency \\nrequirement in the proposed amendment. \\n \\nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \\nI am not sure I want to do that because we have people who are willing to \\nserve. You can talk about institutional knowledge; however, I was not born here \\nor did not grow up here. There are so many things I learned about Nevada while \\nliving here, and it did not take five years. If you have another explanation, I may \\nconsider it. I understand institutional knowledge, and maybe there are things we \\ncan do to ensure the makeup of the Forum as members come and go. The same \\nthing occurs in the Legislature with term limits. As Senators term out, there are \\nnew Senators who come on board with no institutional knowledge and I think \\nwe do well.

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic and for the safety of our \\nstaff, legislators, and the public, the building is currently closed for any physical \\nattendance. We have worked hard to ensure there are various opportunities for \\nthe public to participate with our Committee and be sure we get their input.  \\n \\nAll committee information is available on the Nevada Legislature Website, the \\nNevada Electronic Legislative Information System (NELIS). There is also a Help \\nlink that provides information on how to participate in the meetings by either \\ntestifying,  submitting  written  testimony  or  exhibits,  sharing  your  opinion \\nthrough the application on NELIS, and watching the meetings either through the \\nWebsite or on the YouTube channel. \\n \\nI will entertain a motion to adopt the Senate Committee on Health and Human \\nServices Rules for the 2021 Session (Exhibit B).  \\n \\nSENATOR HARDY MOVED TO ADOPT THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON \\nHEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES RULES FOR THE 2021 SESSION AS \\nSUBMITTED. \\n \\nSENATOR KIECKHEFER SECONDED THE MOTION. \\n \\n  THE  MOTION  CARRIED.  (SENATOR  SPEARMAN  WAS  EXCUSED  FOR \\nTHE VOTE.) \\n \\n* * * * * \\n \\nI want to note for the public and members of this Committee; typically, we have \\nabout two weeks of introductory presentations from the Department of Health \\nand Human Services (DHHS) to establish a baseline understanding about DHHS \\nand its divisions. Given that we have a relatively tenured Committee, we will \\nnot  do  those  basic  agency  presentations  in  this  Committee.  The  Assembly \\nCommittee on Health and Human Services, which does have new members, will \\nbe hearing those presentations. If the public or a member of this Committee \\nwish  to  view  those  presentations,  they  can  watch  them  at  the  Assembly \\nCommittee on Health and Human Services meetings. \\n \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 4, 2021 \\nPage 3 \\n \\nThe only presentation before this Committee is the Cannabis Compliance Board \\nbecause we are new to this area. \\n \\nTYLER KLIMAS (Executive Director, Nevada Cannabis Compliance Board): \\nI will provide an overview of the Nevada Cannabis Compliance Board (CCB). My \\ntestimony will address how this agency has operated over the past 12 months. I \\nwill read from my written testimony, (Exhibit C) pages 1 through 3. \\n \\nI will now present, the Nevada Cannabis Compliance Board Agency Overview \\n(Exhibit D) on slides 1 through 19. I will be reading from my written testimony, \\nExhibit C, pages 3 through 9. \\n \\nLast  Session,  there  was  considerable  discussion  on  cannabis  consumption \\nlounges contained in A.B. No. 533 of the 80th Session. The CCB was required \\nto submit a report on these lounges to the Legislature by January 1, 2021.  I \\nincluded that report as supplemental material for the Committee, the Study on \\nNevada Cannabis Consumption Lounges (Exhibit E). \\n \\nI can answer any questions and then will move on to Senate Bill (S.B.) 49. \\n \\nSENATE BILL 49: Revises provisions relating to cannabis. (BDR 56-268) \\n \\nSENATOR HARDY: \\nI had misgivings about the Cannabis Compliance Board, but I have been very \\nimpressed with Mr. Klimas's presentation and appreciate the work the CCB has \\ndone. \\n \\nCHAIR RATTI: \\nWe will now open the hearing on S.B. 49. \\n \\nMR. KLIMAS: \\nThe CCB is presenting S.B. 49, which is our only bill this Session. It is primarily \\nhousekeeping  and  clarifying  language  and  includes  the  CCB  proposed \\namendment (Exhibit F). My staff will give a presentation on S.B. 49 (Exhibit G). \\n  \\nMICHAEL MILES (Deputy Director, Nevada Cannabis Compliance Board): \\nI will be discussing section 1 of S.B. 49 that requests the removal of Nevada \\nRevised Statute (NRS) 678A.530, subsection 2, which addresses depositions as \\n   \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 4, 2021 \\nPage 4 \\n \\nset out on page 3 of Exhibit G. My written testimony begins on page 9 through \\npage 10 of Exhibit C. I will also be discussing the proposed CCB amendment to \\nS.B. 49, Exhibit F. \\n \\nDAVID  STALEY  (Chief  Compliance/Audit  Investigator,  Nevada  Cannabis \\nCompliance Board): \\nI will be discussing section 2 of S.B. 49 that requests additional language be \\nincluded in NRS 678B.340 as set out in Exhibit G, page 4. My written testimony \\nis on page 10 of Exhibit C. \\n \\nSENATOR HARDY: \\nI am not sure what this does with regard to the 5 percent rule.  Does it allow \\npeople to potentially get out of being identified as an owner, volunteer or under \\na contract as it pertains to less than 5 percent ownership? What are you looking \\nto do that is new and different than before? \\n \\nMR. STALEY: \\nThe request for additional language does not provide for anything new. We felt \\nthere  could  be  potential  confusion  because  the  language  provided  in \\nNRS 678B.340 was used by the CCB to craft the waiver regulations we have in \\nplace.  We  are  moving  that  language  from  NRS  678A.450,  duplicating  and \\nputting  it  in  NRS  678B.340  to  clarify  the  CCB  has  the  opportunity  to \\npromulgate  regulations  that  provide  the  ability  to  waive  the  requirement  for \\nagent cards for individuals with less than 5 percent ownership.  \\n \\nThe NRS provides that anyone with ownership interest and that could include \\none  single  share  of  a  company  or  1  percent  of  ownership,  our  regulations \\nrequire a background investigation. They receive an agent card registering them \\nwith the CCB for their ownership of the company. Most companies have four or \\nfive different owners. It is not a burdensome process for us or the industry to \\nconduct the background investigation on all those individuals. \\n \\nThe various publicly traded companies and some of the private companies have \\nmany investors who have no control or involvement in the operations of the \\ncannabis establishment. For instance, we have closely held private companies \\nwherein one of the owners gave his or her share to someone in the family. That \\nperson has no involvement in the running of the cannabis establishment. The \\nCovid-19 issues make it difficult for anyone to get their fingerprints taken or \\nhave a background check performed.  \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 4, 2021 \\nPage 5 \\n \\nFollowing the gaming model, one of the premises we have identified is the \\nconcept  of  controls  being  important  with  all  of  our  different  cannabis \\nestablishments and licensees. If a company initially requests a waiver according \\nto Nevada Cannabis Compliance Regulations (NCCR) 5.112 or NCCR 5.125 and \\nprovides information it has less than 5 percent shareholders and is not involved \\nin control or operation of the company, it gives CCB leeway to allow those \\nindividuals not to go through the agent card process. \\n \\nFor  a  publicly  traded  company  that  has  thousands  of  shareholders,  such  a \\nrequirement is onerous and restricts the ability of that company to have its \\nshares traded on a daily basis. Without the waiver, someone who wanted to \\nbuy ten shares of that company today and sell them tomorrow would not be \\nable  to  because  our  regulations  would  normally  require  their  licensure.  The \\nproposed language does not eliminate our regulations that require individuals in \\na control position who have shares or even no shares to file an application for a \\ncannabis  executive  card.  A  chief  executive  officer,  chief  financial  officer, \\nchairman of the board of directors, or any other individual who can exercise \\ncontrol in the company's operations or participate in the profits of a marijuana \\ncompany, are required to be found suitable and obtain an executive agent card \\neven if they have no ownership in the company.  \\n \\nSENATOR HARDY:  \\nWhat waivers exist now and what are the changes? \\n \\nMR. STALEY: \\nThe waivers already exist under NCCR 5.112 and 5.125 and were promulgated \\nbased on the ability provided to the CCB under NRS 678A.450. We are not \\nadding any new regulations  or anything new to the statute. We are simply \\nduplicating the language already in statute and  moving it to areas where it \\nclarifies any questions there may be under NRS 678B.340. We already have the \\nwaivers in place that were approved by the CCB at its July 21, 2020 meeting. \\nThe CCB has approved waivers both for individuals on closely held companies \\nand larger numbers of shareholders for publicly traded companies.  \\n \\nSENATOR HARDY: \\nWhat will happen to the individual family member who was given one share? \\n  \\n   \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 4, 2021 \\nPage 6 \\n \\nMR. STALEY: \\nNothing will happen unless the company first applies for a waiver. The individual \\nwe discussed is required to submit fingerprints and go through our background \\ninvestigation to get an agent card even though he or she has never been to the \\ncultivation production site. If a company submits an application for a waiver \\nunder NCCR 5.112 or NCCR 5.125 and is able to provide sufficient evidence \\nthat a shareholder has no involvement or control over the operations of the \\ncannabis establishment, the CCB can approve the waiver. The individual then \\ndoes not need to get an agent card or submit fingerprints for a background \\ninvestigation because the individual has no ability to influence the operations of \\nthe  cannabis  establishment.  We  look  closely  at  the  concept  of  control  and \\nability for someone to be involved in control that would not be suitable under \\nthe requirements of our regulations and statutes. \\n \\nSENATOR HARDY: \\nIf an individual had a 1 percent ownership and that individual's family members \\nequally had 1 percent, this regulation would allow each one of them not to be \\nfingerprinted  or  investigated.  By  the  time  each  of  them  had  1  percent \\ncollectively, they would have a controlling interest and would have control. \\n \\nMR. STALEY: \\nYour  question  provides  evidence  of  control.  We  would  look  at  familial \\nownership, ownership from a spouse or through a family, as just mentioned. If \\nthe amount of ownership indicated they could exercise a certain amount of \\ncontrol over the operations, then the CCB would likely determine such a waiver \\nwas  not  appropriate.  Through  ongoing  audits  and  investigations  performed \\nduring a transfer of interest, our investigators and agents are looking for hidden \\nownership or people who may be exerting control that do not have an agent \\ncard. I would expect anyone exerting any significant control over the operations \\nof a company, and both exist within the statutes and regulations, to call them \\nforward at the CCB's discretion even if a waiver is in place. \\n \\nSENATOR HARDY: \\nHave you already come across this situation? \\n \\nMR. STALEY: \\nNo, we have not. The CCB has approved seven or eight waivers at this point. In \\nall  cases,  the  companies  provided  us  with  information  indicating  either  the \\nindividual or group of individuals they were waiving did not have an element of \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 4, 2021 \\nPage 7 \\n \\ncontrol over the company. The agent's independent review of company records \\nincludes  asking  the  company  to  provide  further  information,  including \\ndisclosures  included  in  their  audited  financial  statements  with  the  Canadian \\nSecurities  Exchange  (CSE)  or  the  U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission \\n(SEC). The agents tested the attestations of the licensee and were able to find it \\ndid not appear any of the individuals that would be affected by that waiver \\nwould have any level of control which would have necessitated an agent card. \\n \\nSENATOR HARDY: \\nIf you depend on the company to tell you things and you investigate based on \\nwhat they tell you, what are the consequences if the company lies to you, and \\nthey did have some control? \\n \\nMR. STALEY: \\nA  question  of  consequences  would  go  to  the  CCB  members,  who  are  the \\nindividuals  that  make  those  decisions.  If  we  determined  that  there  were \\nindividuals in a control position and had tried to circumvent our agent card \\nrequirements, we would identify the circumstances. We would do a personal \\ninterview  with  them  and  the  other  executives.  The  CCB  would  receive  the \\ninformation  under  an  areas  of  concern  section  in  our  investigative  report  in \\nwhich  we  would  lay  out  all  the  facts  that  were  ascertained.  It  would  not \\nsurprise me where an individual exerted a level of control without submitting the \\nagent  card  application.  What  would  surprise  me  is  if  they  did  so  with  the \\nexpress intent to circumvent our requirements. I would initially expect it would \\nbe  a  communication  problem  or  mistake;  however,  we  would  allow  the \\ncompany an opportunity to address our areas of concern. If we were able to \\ndetermine  it  was  done  specifically  to  circumvent  our  regulatory  structure, \\nknowing the CCB, there would be a wide range of public and difficult penalties \\nassessed against that company. \\n \\nSENATOR HARDY: \\nCould the company then lose its license? \\n \\nMR. STALEY: \\nYes. Our statutes provide that the CCB has a wide range of penalties it can \\nassess against those companies, up to and including the revocation of their \\nlicense. \\n \\n \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 4, 2021 \\nPage 8 \\n \\nCHAIR RATTI: \\nI understand this amendment is generally a clarification of language. What about \\na publicly held corporation where a person technically has an ownership interest \\nbecause they are a stockholder and do not have control. How do you decide if a \\nlarge publicly held corporation has to have this kind of screening? \\n \\nMR. STALEY: \\nPublicly traded companies, both in the CSE and SEC, have certain reporting \\nrequirements. They have to make public disclosures annually, and individuals \\nhave  to  make  disclosures  when  they  acquire  certain  levels  of  shares.  The \\nstatutes  provide  an  under  5  percent  threshold  and  a  5  percent  and  over \\nthreshold. According to regulation, the waivers we have adopted allow us to \\nwaive the requirement that an under 5 percent individual may assess the waiver \\nif they prove they are not in a control position. Anyone 5 percent or over is \\nrequired to get a cannabis executive card and we do not have the ability to \\nwaive that requirement for them. \\n \\nIn a large publicly traded company, a 5 percent position would be a significant \\nposition and is uncommon. A 5 percent position may not give them control, in \\nthe case of an institutional investor who may not want to disclose that it is for \\ninvestment purposes only and will not be exerting any control. The 5 percent \\nthreshold  has  been  determined  by  statute.  We  automatically  assume  that \\nbecause  the  potential  of  a  controlling  or  influencing  position  exists  at  a \\n5 percent threshold or above, any individual or company with an ownership of \\n5 percent or above is required to get an agent card. The CCB can call that \\ncompany forward if they conclude that it should be licensed like an owner or \\nlicensure as an acquisition control. \\n \\nCHAIR RATTI: \\nIf I am in a retirement system that has a 5 percent ownership, how do you \\nprovide me with a card? \\n \\nMR. STALEY: \\nIn the case of a large institutional investor of investment funds or other entities \\nthat  have  pooled  the  investment  ability  of  many,  none  of  the  individual \\nshareholders or participants of the investments guaranteed by the fund have any \\ncontrol of their investment or of the activities of the fund itself. In the case of a \\nfund or investment company that operates a couple of different funds, they will \\nhave  fund  managers  or  have  executives  identified  that  manage  or  run  the \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 4, 2021 \\nPage 9 \\n \\ninvesting activities of the company and are responsible for those investments. If \\nthat is the case, they are identified by the company for us, and we require that \\nthe fund or institutional investors provide us with an understanding of how \\ndecisions  are  made  for  the  fund  and  the  individuals  that  can  make  those \\ndecisions are required to have an agent card. \\n \\nThese concepts mirror the best practices of the Nevada Gaming Control Board. \\nWhile our statutes and regulations are not as detailed or far reaching, it was \\nimportant  that  we  look  to  the  premises  and  concepts  of  control  and  basic \\npremises of regulations by the Board, take those best practices, and use them \\nfor the cannabis industry. \\n \\nCHAIR RATTI: \\nAre you saying the practices mirror the gaming industry, but the statutory or \\nregulatory framework does not? \\n \\nMR. STALEY: \\nOur regulatory framework does mirror gaming though it is not as expansive. The \\nBoard has separate regulations for limited liability companies, corporations and \\npublicly traded companies. When we crafted our regulations pursuant to statute, \\nwe did not lay out the specific delineations as the different types of companies. \\nInstead,  we  went  to  the  core  concept  of  control  over  the  operations  of  a \\ncannabis establishment. \\n \\nSTEVE  GILBERT  (Marijuana  Program  Manager,  Nevada  Cannabis  Compliance \\nBoard): \\nSection 3 of S.B. 49 cleans up language in NRS 678B.520 and helps address \\nconsistent labeling of products as set forth on page 5 of Exhibit G. I will read \\nfrom my written testimony on bottom of pages 10 and 11 of Exhibit C. \\n  \\nCHAIR RATTI: \\nI have a question about existing stock and if it grandfathers in anything that has \\nbeen produced within a certain time frame. How are you working through the \\ntransition of existing labels? \\n \\nMR. GILBERT: \\nWe are allowing the industry to work through the existing labels. We will be \\nlooking at their time frame to work through those labels, whether the labels \\nhave been approved and if the packaging must change. \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 4, 2021 \\nPage 10 \\n \\nCHAIR RATTI: \\nDo you see that happening through a regulatory process where it is clear what \\nthe cut-off date is for using those labels? \\n \\nMR. GILBERT: \\nThat will be guidance that is given from the CCB to the industry.  \\n \\nCHAIR RATTI: \\nIt seems like the CCB has more flexibility to get things done than perhaps some \\nother agencies with whom we are accustomed to dealing. There might need to \\nbe more clarity in either the NRS or the Nevada Administrative Code. Am I \\nreading that wrong? \\n \\nMR. GILBERT: \\nWe are in the process of looking at the regulations and potential upcoming \\nworkshops to go over the packaging labels and guidelines. \\n \\nCHAIR RATTI: \\nYou are basically on the record saying that if people have existing stock they \\nwill be able to use that stock? \\n \\nMR. GILBERT: \\nYes. \\n \\nSENATOR HARRIS: \\nBy removing the difference in labeling to medical cannabis and regular cannabis \\nproducts, would this inhibit police enforcement's ability to know if someone has \\na medical product even if they do not have a medical card? \\n \\nMR. GILBERT: \\nNo, it would not. Cannabis is cultivated and labeled up to the point of sale. It is \\nlabeled as a single source and that product is designated as medical at that \\npoint of sale. If a person was questioned on the cannabis they have in their \\npossession, they should have their medical marijuana registration card for that \\npurpose. \\n \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 4, 2021 \\nPage 11 \\n \\nSENATOR HARRIS: \\nIn order for law enforcement to ask the individual to provide a medical card, \\nhow would they be able to tell if the marijuana is medical grade? \\n \\nMR. GILBERT: \\nIf the product was medical-grade level, possession limits for medical cannabis \\nallowed is two and one-half ounces while possession for non-medical cannabis \\nis a one-ounce purchase. \\n \\nSENATOR HARRIS: \\nAm I incorrect in assuming that there are some strains that are allowed to be \\nsold as medical but not recreational? \\n \\nMR. GILBERT: \\nYes. \\n \\nCHAIR RATTI: \\nI think clarity on this is essential so we have it on the record. All products that \\ncontain cannabis can be used for either adult or medical use, but there are a \\nsmall subsection of products that can only be used for medical use because of \\nthe concentration within that product. Is that correct? \\n \\nMR. GILBERT: \\nYes.  \\n \\nCHAIR RATTI: \\nAre the higher concentration products only sold for medical use? The rest of it is \\na matter of taxation; whether or not you pay the extra 10 percent? \\n \\nMR. GILBERT: \\nThat is correct. \\n \\nMR. KLIMAS: \\nI will go through the amendment, Exhibit F, which includes language to provide \\nadditional flexibility to extend the 45-day requirement for the CCB to hold a \\nhearing  after  a  licensee  answers  a  complaint.  In  some  cases,  especially  in \\ncomplicated disciplinary matters, 45 days is not enough time for either side to \\ngather the resources to hold an appropriate hearing. The aim will always be to \\nmove expeditiously through these hearings and complaints. \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 4, 2021 \\nPage 12 \\n \\nThis amendment allows for a request to be made to the CCB Chair for approval \\nof an extension of the 45-day hearing requirement. Section 2 simplifies the \\nprocess  for  serving  complaints  against  a  licensee.  The  way  the  statute  is \\nwritten, the CCB has to vote blindly on approving service of a complaint that \\nshould be a procedural matter. They do not get to see the complaint or know \\nwho the complaint is filed against; they just know that the CCB and the Office \\nof the Attorney General recommended that it be filed. It becomes an onerous \\nprocess that is not a good use of staff or their time. The CCB Chair and board \\nmembers made this point known at our first meeting. \\n \\nThis  amendment  allows  the  Executive  Director  of  the  CCB  to  serve  the \\ncomplaint  and  does  not  change  any  part  of  the  process.  Section  3  of  the \\namendment  allows  the  CCB  to  employ  additional  services  to  assist  in \\ndisciplinary proceedings when necessary. This is a part-time Board that needs to \\nutilize services of an administrative law judge in certain disciplinary matters. \\nThis keeps the hearing process moving and is critical to allow for an appropriate \\npace in its oversight responsibilities. \\n \\nSENATOR HARRIS: \\nI have a question about the extension of the 45-day hearing requirement. Can \\nyou tell me about why you chose to give the CCB the ability to extend that \\nindefinitely as opposed to giving yourselves more time? Instead of 45 days, why \\nnot change it to 90 days or 120 days? \\n \\nMR. KLIMAS: \\nThe goal is to always move quickly within the 45 days. We thought allowing \\n90 to 120 days to the process would further delay the hearing. We have cases \\ntwo years old we inherited. We want to keep the hearings on a tight schedule. \\n \\nSENATOR HARRIS: \\nWould you be willing to consider putting constraints on the CCB so people \\nknow they have the right to have their cases heard within a certain time period. \\nIf extensions can be continually granted, then it will never be known how long it \\nmight take and there is no further guarantee. The 45 days becomes irrelevant. \\n \\nMR. KLIMAS: \\nI understand what you are saying and we can look into adding some guidelines. \\nIf someone applies for an extension, and the Chair grants a certain amount of \\ntime, the option would be to continually grant an extension. I do not think that \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 4, 2021 \\nPage 13 \\n \\nwould be the intent and would not work out well for the CCB, staff or licensee. \\nI would hope that practice would not be common. I can tell you that I, as Chair, \\nwould not make it a common practice. \\n \\nCHAIR RATTI: \\nWe are going to want to get clarity on this issue. The CCB or staff would not \\nrequest an extension, the request for an extension would only come from the \\npetitioners, correct? \\n \\nMR.

(BDR 39-431) \\n \\nDOROTHY EDWARDS (Behavioral Health Coordinator, Washoe Regional Behavioral \\nHealth Policy Board, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, Department \\nof Health and Human Services): \\nI will read from my written testimony (Exhibit B). \\n \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 9, 2021 \\nPage 3 \\n \\nCHAIR RATTI:  \\nThere are four one-page summaries with helpful information on each of the bill \\ncomponents  submitted  as  exhibits  by  Washoe  Regional  Behavioral  Health \\n(Exhibit C, Exhibit D, Exhibit E and Exhibit F). \\n \\nSEAN O’DONNELL (Executive Director, Foundation for Recovery): \\nI will read from my written presentation (Exhibit G) to present S.B. 69. \\n \\nNATALIE POWELL (Director, Nevada Certification Board): \\nI will provide a brief history of the Nevada Certification Board (NCB) (Exhibit H) \\nand read from my written presentation (Exhibit I). \\n \\nStates  may  maintain  up  to  two  International  Certification  & Reciprocity \\nConsortium  (IC&RC)  Boards  if  needed.  These  boards  can  license  or  certify \\nbehavioral health service providers in prevention, treatment and recovery.  \\n \\nThe NCB was granted permission to apply to IC&RC by the State Board of \\nExaminers for drug, alcohol and gambling counselors. In 2016, we received \\npermission to be a secondary board and were accepted into the IC&RC.  \\n \\nOur  task  was  to  provide  a  voluntary  certification  process  for  peer  recovery \\nsupport and prevention specialists that would meet or exceed IC&RC standards.  \\n \\nIn 2018, the NCB was asked by the Division of Public and Behavioral Health to \\nprovide a similar voluntary certification process for community health workers. \\nWe now provide voluntary certification for three occupations in community and \\nbehavioral health.  \\n \\nIn terms  of our mission, vision and the importance of certification, refer to \\nExhibit I for contact information and links to the NCB and IC&RC websites. \\n \\nIn 2017, we held an IC&RC-endorsed pilot or grandfathering period for our peer \\nspecialist  certification  process.  The  purpose  of  the  pilot  was  to  allow \\ncertification for peer specialists already working in the field and well established, \\nand work out any issues in our certification process.  \\n \\nDuring the pilot period, we certified 59 peer recovery and support specialists. \\nSince this pilot, we have certified an additional 91 peers, making a total of \\n150 specialists working in the State. Additionally, we have 242 peers who have \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 9, 2021 \\nPage 4 \\n \\nstarted the application process with the NCB. The application process can take \\nup to a year to complete. Applications consist of proof of a high school diploma \\nor  equivalency,  and  a  minimum  of  46  hours  of  State-approved  specialized \\ntraining in IC&RC peer domains. \\n  \\nOur two State-approved training organizations are Foundation for Recovery and \\nthe  Center  for  the  Application  of  Substance  Abuse  Technologies,  at  the \\nUniversity of Nevada, Reno.  \\n \\nAlso required are 500 hours of supervised experience in those peer domains and \\npassing the IC&RC peer recovery examination. To be a certified peer recovery \\nspecialist,  you  need  lived  experience  in  substance  abuse,  mental  health  or \\nprocess addiction, along with a required minimum of two years in recovery. We \\nwant people to be stable so they can help others. The IC&RC peer domains \\nrequire demonstration in proficiency and include advocacy, ethical responsibility, \\nmentoring in education and recovery and wellness support. \\n \\nLINDA LANG (Director, Nevada Statewide Coalition Partnership): \\nI will read from written testimony (Exhibit J). \\n \\nCHAIR RATTI:  \\nThere is a proposed conceptual amendment to S.B. 69 (Exhibit K) under my \\nname. \\n \\nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \\nMr.  O’Donnell,  is  there  a  section  that  pertains  to  applicability  related  to \\ncompensation, such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) sponsors? \\n \\nMR. O’DONNELL: \\nWhat  I  presented  included  the  conceptual  amendment  which  made  the \\nclarification that certification would apply to those using those titles or those \\ncompensated to provide these services.  \\n \\nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \\nAre these services billable under Medicaid or commercial insurance, and is State \\nMedicaid billing for them now?  \\n \\nMR. O’DONNELL: \\nYes. \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 9, 2021 \\nPage 5 \\n \\nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \\nIs certification a qualification for billing services? If one is not certified, can they \\nbill for services? \\n \\nMR. O’DONNELL: \\nTo my knowledge, certification is not required to bill for services. \\n \\nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \\nMs.  Powell,  is  a  high  school  diploma  or  equivalency  required  to  become \\ncertified? \\n \\nMS. POWELL: \\nA high school diploma or equivalency is required for each of our certifications.  \\n \\nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \\nAs this is specifically outlined as nonclinical and lived experience, why should \\nthat be a requirement and possible barrier? \\n \\nMS. POWELL: \\nIt is a requirement of the IC&RC and an international requirement we subscribe \\nto. We wanted to standardize the process and are happy to help with the GED \\nprocess if that is a barrier.  \\n \\nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \\nMs. Lang, is the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) individually \\nidentifiable or aggregated? \\n \\nMS. LANG: \\nNo, that is the reason for the minimum required response rate of 60 percent. \\nExhibit F shows the response rates across the various counties and how close \\nwe are to not reaching that 60 percent. We cannot go through individual school \\ndistricts much lower than 60 percent before the data can be identified. The \\nschool districts that participate can receive this data and use it as they wish. \\n \\nSENATOR KIECKHEFER: \\nOn an aggregated basis, not with the individual identifiable information, correct? \\n \\nMS. LANG: \\nCorrect, no individual information. \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 9, 2021 \\nPage 6 \\n \\nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \\nMs. Powell, why is lived experience important? \\n \\nMR. O’DONNELL: \\nLived experience for peer recovery support specialists is the crux of what makes \\nthese services work. I have training in learned experience of confidentiality, \\ntools for  motivational interviewing, advocacy and mentorship.  This could be \\nlearned in a class setting; however, as a peer recovery support specialist with \\nlived  experience  in  incarceration  or  homelessness,  one  could  relate  to  an \\nindividual removing the power differential. A peer recovery support specialist is \\nseen as a peer having had similar life experiences who can help to navigate \\nsystems  and  rebuild  a  life  relating  to  one  another  because  of  those  lived \\nexperiences. \\n \\nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \\nCultural competency was a topic discussed last Session. Speaking with people \\nwho understand where you are and what you have been through and the power \\ndifferential, there would be no judgement, correct? \\n \\nMR. O’DONNELL: \\nYes. A great example of that is the concept of matching someone in need of \\nhelp with someone experiencing similar circumstances. If someone is seeking \\npeer  recovery  support,  you  would  attempt  to  match  them  with  a  specialist \\nbased  on  those  same  experiences.  As  a  member  of  the  LGBTQ  community \\nmyself, it may be more beneficial to work directly with other members of that \\ncommunity as they are able to relate with their experiences.  \\n \\nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \\nIt  is  important  to  speak  with  someone  having  that  lived  experience  and \\ncredibility within your community and have them represent those communities \\npresent in Nevada. \\n \\nSenate Bill No. 204 of the 80th Session pertaining to suicide prevention had \\nelements suggesting a nexus between what you are doing and what the school \\nsystem  is  attempting.  Ms.  Lang,  I  would  like  to  speak  with  you  offline  to \\ncollaborate to boost support for your program. \\n \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 9, 2021 \\nPage 7 \\n \\nMS. LANG: \\nI would be happy to meet with you offline and will reach out to you. I am \\nfamiliar with that bill and the report required. \\n \\nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \\nWe have had many suicides in Clark County, and we need to do better with \\nthat. Some elements would be very helpful if implemented with what you are \\nsuggesting.  \\n \\nCHAIR RATTI: \\n“For the record, the bill would include peer experiences in behavioral health as \\nmuch  as  substance  abuse  disorder.”  The  provisions  in  this  bill  around \\nevidence-based prevention are based on S.B. No. 204 of the 80th Session. \\n \\nSENATOR HARDY: \\nI am unsure of the difference between the 46 hours versus the 500 hours of \\nsupervised experience. Is tuition required for the 500 hours, and are applicants \\nable to be peer recovery specialists while waiting for certification? What is the \\nprocess for certification? \\n \\nMS. POWELL: \\nThe 46 hours of instruction are classroom hours in advocacy, mentoring and \\neducation,  recovery  and  wellness  support,  and  ethical  responsibility.  It  is \\nweighted more heavily toward ethical responsibility. \\n \\nThe 500 hours are supervised experience working in the IC&RC peer domains. I \\ncan provide the matrix of the tasks pertaining to these domains if necessary. \\nThe IC&RC is a resource for us. They complete a job analysis of certifications \\nand credentials every five to seven years. They have nationwide or international \\nsubject matter experts researching this field and updating the examinations in \\nkeeping with best evidence-based practices.  \\n \\nTraditionally, peers are eligible for hire by agencies prior to certification. We \\nhave advisory committees for each certification made up of those in the field \\nwho  are  subject  matter  experts.  Previously,  peers  felt  there  was  sufficient \\nemployment available to have people perform these supervised hours before \\nbecoming certified. As the proposed amendment, Exhibit K, shows, we will be \\nproviding for the possibility of an internship. Interns could complete those hours \\nby  either  volunteering  or  mentoring.  Many  agencies  will  pay  peers  for  this \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 9, 2021 \\nPage 8 \\n \\nexperience. We have not had any issue with peers finding paid or volunteer \\npositions to accomplish those hours.  \\n \\nThere is a differentiation between an AA sponsor and a peer recovery support \\nspecialist. We are not able to take peer experience working as a sponsor or with \\nAA or Narcotics Anonymous (NA) group meetings and 12-step programs.  \\n \\nSENATOR HARDY: \\nThe concept of interns theoretically gives people a chance to pay tuition or have \\nremuneration  while  working  toward  their  certifications  in  order  to  support \\nthemselves during those 500 hours. With two years of sobriety and working in \\nthe community, there is a step down in the level of living. An internship also \\nprovides the possibility of an income. \\n \\nMS. POWELL: \\nIn practice, that is happening. This peer recovery support specialist position is \\nseen  as  the  beginning  of  a  clear  career  ladder.  Many  move  on  to  become \\nlicensed counselors and social workers. It is an entry-level start, but they would \\nbe making as much as peers in any position they previously or currently hold.  \\n \\nWe charge $165 to initially certify, $80 of which covers the test given by \\nIC&RC, and the remaining goes to processing. Most peers have agencies that \\nwill cover this cost. This certifies them for 2 years, and within that 2 years, the \\nrenewal obligations are to complete 20 additional hours of continued education \\nunits. Six of those hours must be in ethics to keep that in the forefront, and the \\nremaining 14 hours are anything within the other IC&RC peer domains. The \\nrenewal fee is $100. \\n \\nSENATOR HARDY: \\nWould  this  make  it  illegal  for  peers  to  work  in  the  community  without \\ncertification? \\n \\nMS. POWELL: \\nThere  is  a  grandfathering  period  giving  an  applicant  until  2023  to  become \\ncertified as a recovering intern or a certified peer recovery support specialist. \\nThere are allowances for those who volunteer, specifically for professionals who \\nvolunteer as peers, such as lawyers providing legal advice. \\n \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 9, 2021 \\nPage 9 \\n \\nFor  individuals  practicing  as  peer  recovery  support  specialists  without  being \\ncertified by 2023, there is no criminal penalty; there would be a civil penalty, \\nand these people would be subject to a fine. If they continue to incur fines, they \\ncould be held in contempt of court. At this point, that would be as far as it \\nwould go. \\n \\nSENATOR HARDY: \\nIs there a fiscal note? \\n \\nMS. POWELL: \\nThere is no fiscal note at this time, or it has been cleared. \\n \\nCHAIR RATTI: \\nThere have been many amendments to this bill. We will get information about \\nthe two-thirds majority vote requirement and the fiscal note as we get closer to \\nwork session. \\n \\n“For  the  record,  the  proposed  amendment  only  includes  those  who  will  be \\ncompensated, and that is intentional to exclude AA, NA, any of the 12-step \\ngroups and any other volunteer-driven groups supporting folks in recovery.” \\n \\nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \\nHow do you know if someone is practicing and has not been certified? Is there \\nanything in place to identify those continuing to practice without certification? \\n \\nCHAIR RATTI: \\nIt would be the same process as any other certification and licensing, mostly a \\ncomplaint-driven process. \\n \\nNANCY BOWEN (CEO, Nevada Primary Care Association): \\nThe Nevada Primary Care Association supports S.B. 69. Our members work is \\naffected by at least two provisions in this bill: the sections dealing with peer \\nsupport  specialists  and  the  YRBSS.  Healthcare  centers  have  been  working \\ndiligently to expand substance abuse disorder services across the State. State \\nand federal investments have encouraged the certification providers be able to \\nadminister medication-assisted treatment to expand options for our community. \\nPeer  support  specialists  have  benefited  by  the  programs  in  our  healthcare \\ncenters.  \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 9, 2021 \\nPage 10 \\n \\nClarifying the definition, scope and responsibilities in Nevada Revised Statutes \\n(NRS) will allow this provider type to further develop and produce results. Our \\nmembers are reliant on federal grants to provide services to uninsured residents. \\nBetween 2015 and 2020, we brought more than $188 million in grant funding \\nto Nevada. Securing these grants required current and accurate data. One of the \\nmost important data sources we use is the YRBSS. It is critical for Nevada to do \\neverything necessary to support the collection of this data. \\n \\nDON GIBSON (Behavioral Health Peace Officer, Carson City Sheriff’s Office): \\nI work full time with mental health clinicians and respond to all community crisis \\ncalls  related  to  mental  health.  The  primary  focus  for  my  unit  is  jail  and \\nemergency room diversion. My unit supports S.B. 69 and values the support of \\nour community coalition, Partnership Carson City. Partnership Carson City is an \\ninstrumental stakeholder for the health of our community and proven leader in \\nraising  the  quality  of  life  for  individuals  who  suffer  from  mental  illness  and \\nsubstance abuse.  \\n \\nRACHEL DUNFEE (Healthy Communities Coalition): \\nI am an LGBTQ junior in Silver City and a Stand Tall prevention program team \\nmember who supports S.B. 69. I have been involved with Healthy Communities \\nCoalition  (HCC)  as  a  Stand  Tall  member  for  five  years  which  is  a  great \\nopportunity for youths to get involved in their community. Stand Tall is a place \\nwhere everyone is welcome no matter their past identity, sexual orientation or \\nwalk of life. Stand Tall is a wonderful way to be educated on the dangers of \\ntobacco, cannabis, e-cigarettes and alcohol in youth.  \\n \\nPrograms  such  as  Stand  Tall  create  an  open  conversation  for  youths  who \\nstruggle with addiction. Diversity is important in these prevention groups as \\neveryone has different experiences. We focus on prevention and touch on a \\nvariety  of  subjects  from  prevention  to  mindfulness  and  exploring  artistic \\nopportunities. This program not only teaches youths about prevention, it helps \\nthem teach the rest of the community. Supporting coalitions means supporting \\nthe worlds next generation, teaching us values to last a lifetime.  \\n \\nJOELLE GUTMAN DODSON (Washoe County Health District): \\nWashoe County Health District supports S.B. 69. The implementation of peer \\nrecovery support specialists in Washoe County is part of the Washoe County \\nHealth District’s Community Health Improvement Plan. The certification for peer \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 9, 2021 \\nPage 11 \\n \\nrecovery support specialists will ensure a better standard of practice, elevate \\nthe workforce, help protect the public and set the standard for employers.  \\n \\nThe Health District supports an up-to-date and evidence-based curriculum and \\nprograms concerning substance misuse and abuse disorders in our schools. We \\nare supportive of every school participating in the YRBSS. The more students \\nparticipating in this survey, the more accurate data we have to address the \\nneeds of Nevada’s youth. \\n \\nVINCE COLLINS (Director of Operations, The Gay and Lesbian Community Center \\nof Southern Nevada): \\nThe Gay and Lesbian Community Center of Southern Nevada supports S.B. 69. \\nWe are initiating our first substance use and overdose data-to-action programs \\nemploying a peer support specialist and need this expertise in launching our \\nprogram. Having a baseline standard for peer support adds to our professional \\nenvironment for navigating individuals with linkage to care and services. By \\ndoing this, we impact the LGBTQ community and the greater community of \\nLas Vegas. \\n \\nMALA WHEATLEY (Director, Pacific Behavioral Health): \\nI support S.B. 69. Pacific Behavioral Health provides mental health services to \\nrural counties throughout Nevada. Through our partnership with HCC, we have \\nsuccessfully  collaborated  with  the  Lyon  County  School  District  to  provide \\nmuch-needed, school-based mental health services to students. The Coalition \\nhas provided vital communication, relationships and connections, allowing us to \\nprovide  mental  health  services  to  our  youth.  The  successful  connections  of \\nPacific  Behavioral  Health  with  Lyon  County  students  is  evidence  of  the \\ncollaborative  efforts  of  the  HCC  and  serves  as  a  catalyst  for  community \\nconnections. We have served over 100 students this year and were successful \\nin stabilizing them in their homes and schools, due in part to these collaborative \\nefforts. \\n \\nSUZANNE STROSSER: \\nI  am  an  educator  at  Mission  High  School  in  Las  Vegas  which  is  the \\nfirst publically funded recovery high school in the Nation. Mission High School \\nprovides comprehensive education to students in recovery from substance use, \\nabuse or dependency. We would use peer recovery support specialists to work \\nthrough  responsible-thinking  processes,  productively  addressing  behaviors \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 9, 2021 \\nPage 12 \\n \\ninterfering with those students’ education due to gaps in social and emotional \\nlearning from early onset abuse. \\n \\nPeer support recovery specialists would address student concerns indicated in \\ntheir weekly recovery check-ins and act as a mentors and models as students \\nrecover.  These  relationships  are  beneficial  to  our  students  when  they  are \\napprehensive  toward  obtaining  a  sponsor  during  their  recovery,  after  being \\nadvised to avoid strangers. Baseline standards are necessary in providing this \\nlow-barrier service with safe adults providing effective support to our students. \\n \\nERIN BEEN: \\nI teach health at a high school in the Carson City School District, frequently \\nusing local and State coalition provided tools needed to deliver evidence-based \\nsubstance abuse prevention and mental health curriculum in my classes. I use \\nthe  YRBSS  data  to  frame  evidence-based  curriculum  and  lessons  directly \\nidentified by youth in the community.  \\n \\nCoalitions like Partnership Carson City are valuable to the community. I would \\nlike  my  students  to  leave  my  class  with  content  knowledge,  skills  and \\nresources. I have reached out to Partnership Carson City to plan lessons and \\ncollaborate  in  developing  presentations  and  projects.  Together,  we  have \\ndeveloped  youth  opportunities  after  school  in  the  community,  summer \\nworkshops, evening programs and extended learning opportunities in relation to \\nsubstance abuse prevention and mental health. I support S.B. 69. \\n \\nJOE JOANNE CULVER: \\nI support S.B. 69 and will read from my written testimony (Exhibit L). \\n \\nJOHN  PIRO  (Chief  Deputy  Public  Defender,  Clark  County  Public  Defender’s \\nOffice): \\nI agree to removing section 8, subsection 2, “Any violation of this section is a \\nmisdemeanor,” through the proposed amendment, Exhibit K.  \\n \\nSection 16, subsection 1, paragraph (d) does not raise the criminal penalty but \\nadds the peer recovery support specialist into the growing list of those in an \\nassault or battery constituting a gross misdemeanor rather than a misdemeanor. \\nThis list has grown to the point where the exceptions are starting to swallow \\nthe rules. We need peer support specialists to be protected from aggressive and \\ndangerous  conduct,  however  do  not  believe  there  is  a  correlation  between \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 9, 2021 \\nPage 13 \\n \\nincreasing penalties and reduction in criminal behavior. The U.S. Department of \\nJustice  has  studied  deterrents  in  this  manner  and  the  best  indicator  of \\ndeterrents is a leniency of punishment, not an increase in penalty. \\n \\nIncreasing the penalty to a gross misdemeanor triggers a jury trial as opposed to \\na  misdemeanor  bench  trial  which  increases  the  cost  of  prosecuting  and \\ndefending  these  cases.  Most  affected  by  these  misdemeanor  trials  are  the \\nmentally ill and drug-addicted. Removing section 16 language would allow us to \\ngive our full support of S.B. 69. \\n \\nTREY DELAP (Director, Group Six Partners): \\nI will read from my written testimony in opposition to S.B. 69 (Exhibit M). \\n \\nKENDRA BERTSCHY (Washoe County Public Defender’s Office): \\nThe  Washoe  County  Public  Defender’s  Office  supports  the  peer  support \\ncommunity,  hoping  they  are  able  to  help  the  citizens  of  our  community \\novercome their addictions. For the reasons Mr. Piro stated, we are in opposition. \\nWhen the enhancement was first established, there was testimony as to the \\nconcern of the impact on those with mental health and substance abuse issues. \\nThe  intent  is  to  ensure  we  help  those  involved  in  recovery;  however,  our \\nconcern is the criminal enhancement.  \\n \\nSTEPHANIE WOODARD, PSY.D. (Senior Advisor on Behavioral Health, Division of \\nPublic and Behavioral Health, Department of Health and Human Services): \\nBased  on  conversations  with  the  sponsor  on  the  bill  and  the  conceptual \\namendment,  we  are  able  to  remove  the  fiscal  note  as  it  pertains  to  the \\ndevelopment of regulation.  \\n \\nMARGOT  CHAPPEL  (Deputy  Administrator,  Division  of  Public  and  Behavioral \\nHealth, Department of Health and Human Services): \\nThe amendment removes the fiscal note from the Bureau of Healthcare Quality \\nand Compliance as well. \\n \\nALLISON STEPHENS (Nevada PEP): \\nI will read from my written testimony as neutral on S.B. 69 (Exhibit N), and \\nhave provided a reference document on Family Peer Support (Exhibit O). \\n \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 9, 2021 \\nPage 14 \\n \\nJOANNA JACOB (Clark County): \\nClark County is neutral on Senate Bill 69. I am representing the Department of \\nFamily Services today in a child welfare setting. The child welfare landscape is \\nundergoing  a  fundamental  shift  toward  preventative  services  and \\nevidence-based protocols, requiring implementation of some major policy at the \\nfederal level. This model could be employed in the child welfare system for a \\nparent in long-term successful and ongoing recovery, who may be able to help \\nother  parents  struggling  with  substance  abuse  disorder  or  other  behavioral \\nhealth disorders. We are in support of the overall goal and intent of the bill. We \\nhave  asked  to  consider  a  technical  fix  and  offer  a  proposed  amendment \\n(Exhibit P) to amend in the same requirements as agencies that employ those \\nworking  with  children  or  families  to  undergo  a  background  check  with  the \\nCentral  Registry  for  the  Collection  of  Information  Concerning  the  Abuse  or \\nNeglect of a Child. This would include the screening for any substantiated report \\nof abuse or neglect of a child. This is similar to other background checks in \\nstatute.  \\n \\nDEBRA KAMKA (Director of Operations, Quest Counseling and Consulting): \\nQuest Counseling and Consulting stands neutral on S.B. 69. We have had a \\n16-year  relationship  with  our  community  coalition,  Join  Together  Northern \\nNevada  (JTNN),  which  is  a  collaborative  organization.  Along  with  law \\nenforcement,  JTNN  created  the  first  prescription  drug  roundup  to  address \\nprescription  drug  abuse,  facilitate  monthly  committees  on  a  variety  of \\ndrug-related topics and work with all interested parties to provide solutions to \\ncommunity substance use problems. Quest Counseling and Consulting values \\nthe YRBSS trend reports published by JTNN and its biennial prevention plan. It \\nprovides informational rack cards or prescription drug lockboxes for our clients. \\nCoalitions provide great value and local knowledge in their communities and can \\naddress community problems at the local level quickly and in a cost-efficient \\nmanner.  \\n \\nGWEN TAYLOR (Executive Director, Access For Community & Cultural Education \\nPrograms & Trainings): \\nWe are neutral on S.B. 69. I have worked with the local coalition, JTNN, since \\n2002. Our community has substance abuse prevention coalitions that respond \\nto community needs such as underage drinking, marijuana and prescription drug \\nuse. Through JTNN, we have obtained subgranted general funds and federal \\ngrant  dollars  to  reach  youth  through  evidence-based  programing  in  schools, \\nafter-school programs, juvenile probation and in churches. We impact youth and \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 9, 2021 \\nPage 15 \\n \\nprovide  jobs  to  the  community  through  subgranted  funds.  Join  Together \\nNorthern Nevada is able to bring the community together to address important \\ndrug issues whether facilitating a committee, bringing in a national speaker or \\norganizing a community event. \\n \\nSENATOR RATTI: \\nI will close the hearing on S.B. 69 and open the hearing on S.B. 70. \\n \\nSENATE BILL 70: Revises provisions governing mental health. (BDR 39-418) \\n \\nASSEMBLYWOMAN ROBIN L. TITUS (Assembly District No. 38): \\nSenate  Bill 70  addresses  several  complex,  important  behavioral  healthcare \\nissues in Nevada. This bill results from significant stakeholder engagements, \\nmeetings, time and effort on the part of the Northern Regional Behavioral Health \\nPolicy Board and its Coordinator, Jessica Flood. We met weekly for the better \\npart of a year to develop this piece of legislation and proposed amendment \\n(Exhibit Q).  \\n \\nIn  2017,  the  Legislature  passed  A.B. No. 366  of  the  79th  Session  which \\ncreated the Northern, Washoe, Rural and Southern Behavioral Health Regions. \\nThe bill established a behavioral health policy board for each region. The boards \\nare  responsible  for  improvement  and  delivery  of  behavioral  health  services \\nthroughout the State. They are required to advise relevant Executive Branch \\nagencies  on  regional  behavioral  health  issues,  identify  gaps  in  services  and \\ncoordinate with each other to provide recommendations to the Department of \\nHealth and Human Services. Each board is authorized to request one bill draft \\nrequest with regional, systemic State issues. \\n \\nIn  2019,  A.B. No. 76  of  the  80th  Session  was  sponsored  by  the  Southern \\nRegional Behavioral Health Policy Board which revised the geographic locations \\ncreating a fifth board and establishing the Clark Behavioral Health Region which \\nnow consists of Clark County and a portion of Nye County.  \\n \\nThe 2021 Legislative Session is the second session in which the behavioral \\nhealth policy boards have submitted a BDR. In 2019, the Northern Regional \\nBehavioral Health Policy Board sponsored A.B. No. 85 of the 80th Session to \\naddress  additional  gaps  and  challenges  existing  in  the  behavioral  healthcare \\nsystem to better serve vulnerable Nevadans. \\n \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 9, 2021 \\nPage 16 \\n \\nTAYLOR ALLISON (Chair, Northern Regional Behavioral Health Policy Board): \\nI will review the presentation for S.B. 70, Modernizing and Clarifying the Mental \\nHealth Crisis Hold Process, from the Northern Regional Behavioral Health Policy \\nBoard (Exhibit R), covering slides 1 through 3. \\n \\nWe are focused on modernizing, standardizing and reducing stigma in Nevada’s \\nmental health crisis hold process found in Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 433A. \\nWe are continuing the work initiated by our previous bill, A.B. No. 85 of the \\n80th  Session,  which  passed  with  bipartisan  support  in  between \\nLegislative Sessions.  \\n \\nAssembly Bill No. 85 of the 80th Session was brought forth by the Northern \\nBoard after the need for policy change was identified in 2018. Individuals in \\ncrisis in hospital emergency rooms have waited up to ten days for inpatient beds \\nin psychiatric facilities. There have been various interpretations from courts and \\nproviders on when the 72-hour clock begins, and NRS 433A utilized language to \\ncreate additional stigma of individuals experiencing a mental health crisis. \\n \\nJessica Flood established a multiuse disciplinary, statewide mental health crisis \\nhold working group to take a deep dive into the language and address those \\ncritical  issues.  During  the  process  of  developing  A.B. No. 85  of  the \\n80th Session, stakeholders gained a greater understanding of the issues and \\ngaps in the law and saw the need for continued legislative efforts to update \\nNRS 433A to better reflect the mental health crisis hold system we have today.  \\n \\nSince A.B. No. 85 of the 80th Session passed, the statewide mental health \\ncrisis workgroup has continued to meet, working collaboratively with State staff \\nand the Division of Public and Behavioral Health. They worked on regulations \\nmandating hospital reporting of mental health crisis holds, clarifying medical \\nclearance,  behavioral  health  transportation  and  the  process  for  involuntary \\nadministration of medication. \\n \\nThe  Navigating  Your  Way  Through  a  Mental  Health  Crisis  Hold  in  Nevada \\nbooklet emailed to the Senate Health and Human Services Committee reviews \\nthe hold process, current law and patient rights. If S.B. 70 passes, the working \\ngroup will continue to update the packet to reflect modern practice. \\n \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 9, 2021 \\nPage 17 \\n \\nJESSICA FLOOD (Coordinator, Northern Regional Behavioral Health Policy Board): \\nI will provide an overview of mental health crisis holds in the remaining slides of \\nour presentation, Exhibit R,  slide 5, labeled Mental Health Crisis Hold while \\nreading from my written presentation (Exhibit S). \\n \\nSENATOR HARRIS: \\nAre there concerns that when a peace officer comes to effectuate an order, the \\nofficer may end up arresting the individual? Are there safeguards to ensure the \\nindividual will enter into the mental health system, or will peace officers still be \\nable to make an arrest? \\n \\nMS. FLOOD: \\nThis is not an issue contemplated in the law. \\n \\nKATIE RYAN (Dignity Health - St. Rose Dominican): \\nI  have  provided  a  letter  of  support  (Exhibit  T)  on  behalf  of  Dignity \\nHealth - St. Rose Dominican.  \\n \\nMS. BERTSCHY: \\nThe  Washoe  County  Public  Defender’s  Office  represented  2,185  individuals \\nduring 2020 in involuntary commitment hearings. Unfortunately, the example \\ngiven earlier by Ms. Flood, happens more than we would like. There are times \\nwhen individuals involved in mental health crisis end up being arrested rather \\nthan taken to a mental health treatment facility. This is something we hope to \\nwork on in the future. It is the goal of the stakeholders to decrease interactions \\nof law enforcement with someone experiencing a mental health crisis.  \\n \\nIn  section  11,  regarding  the  definition  of  when  someone  is  involved  in \\ninvoluntary commitment, the intent is not to expand but to capture more people. \\nThis  will  be  followed  closely  as  the  bill  nears  enactment  to  ensure  we  are \\nfocusing on the individuals of need. We support S.B. 70. \\n \\nJIM HOFFMAN (Nevada Attorneys for Criminal Justice): \\nI echo the comments by Ms. Bertschy and am in support of S.B. 70 and the \\namendment. \\n \\nJOAN HALL (President, Nevada Rural Hospital Partners): \\nNevada Rural Hospital Partners supports S.B. 70.  \\n \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 9, 2021 \\nPage 18 \\n \\nJOANNE  MALAY  (Deputy  Administrator,  Clinical  Services  and  Mental  Health, \\nDivision  of  Public  and  Behavioral  Health,  Department  of  Health  and \\nHuman Services): \\nThe Division of Public and Behavioral Health is neutral on this bill. We submitted \\na fiscal note based on introductory language. Previous language in section 11 \\nwas  permissible  as  Northern  Nevada  Adult  Mental  Health  Services  and  the \\nSubstance  Abuse  and  Mental  Health  Services  Administration  are  the  only \\ncurrent assisted outpatient treatment (AOT) programs. Without additional staff \\nand other essentials, we would not be able to take on the additional workload. \\nThe amendment, section 18 resolves the fiscal impact to the satisfaction of the \\nDivision. The amendment Exhibit Q, adds that AOT would be ordered in the \\ncounty where he or she resides, only if such services are available. \\n \\nAnother  language  amendment,  if  adopted,  resolves  further  fiscal  notes.  The \\nlanguage regarding the intended evaluation would be ordered and responsibility \\nfor  the  cost  of  the  examination  was  amended  to  state,  “other  than  those \\nidentified in section 11, subsection 1, paragraphs (d) and (e)” of S.B. 70. \\n \\nCHAIR RATTI: \\nI will close the hearing on S.B. 70.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRemainder of page intentionally left blank; signature page to follow.   \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 9, 2021 \\nPage 19 \\n \\nCHAIR RATTI: \\nAs there is no public comment, this meeting is adjourned at 6:03 p.m. \\n \\n \\n \\nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\nVickie Polzien, \\nCommittee Secretary \\n \\n \\nAPPROVED BY: \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \\n \\n \\nDATE:     \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 9, 2021 \\nPage 20 \\n \\nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \\nExhibit  Begins \\nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \\nLetter  on Page \\n  A  1    Agenda \\nDorothy Edwards / \\nS.B. 69  B  1  Department of Health  Bill Presentation Testimony \\nand Human Services \\nWashoe Regional \\nS.B. 69  C  1  Prevention Overview \\nBehavioral Health \\nWashoe Regional  Assuring a Trained Certified \\nS.B. 69  D  1 \\nBehavioral Health  Peer Workforce \\nWashoe Regional \\nS.B. 69  E  1  Coalition Infographic \\nBehavioral Health \\nWashoe Regional \\nS.B. 69  F  1  Consent Infographic \\nBehavioral Health \\nS.B. 69  G  1  Sean O’Donnell  Bill Presentation Testimony \\nNatalie Powell / Nevada  Nevada Certification Board \\nS.B. 69  H  1 \\nCertification Board  Definitions \\nNatalie Powell / Nevada \\nS.B. 69  I  1  Bill Presentation Testimony \\nCertification Board \\nLinda Lang / Nevada \\nS.B. 69  J  1  Statewide Coalition  Bill Presentation Testimony \\nPartnership \\nS.B. 69  K  1  Senator Julia Ratti  Proposed Amendment \\nS.B. 69  L  1  Joanne Culver  Support Statement \\nTrey Delap / GroupSix  Opposition and Concern \\nS.B. 69  M  1 \\nPartners  Statement \\nAllison Stephens / \\nS.B. 69  N  1  Neutral Statement \\nNevada PEP \\nAllison Stephens /  Family Peer Support At A \\nS.B. 69  O  1 \\nNevada PEP  Glance \\nJoanna Jacob / Clark \\nS.B. 69  P  1  Proposed Amendment \\nCounty  \\nAssemblywoman Robin \\nS.B. 70  Q  1  Proposed Amendment \\nL.

(BDR R-189) \\n \\nSENATOR JOSEPH P. HARDY (Senatorial District No. 12): \\nThis is a bill urging business owners to provide personal protective equipment \\n(PPE) to their workers. If we can do something that prevents the spread of the \\ncoronavirus, also called SARS-CoV-2, which causes the Covid-19 disease, we \\nwill protect our businesses, families, and people who come into our businesses. \\nThere are many different ways we can enjoy protection, not just through the \\nvaccines, that we can do now. \\n \\nThe bill provides businesses the opportunity to protect everyone, and for us, as \\na Legislature, by sending a copy of this resolution to the Labor Commissioner. \\nAt the Legislative Counsel Bureau, we have made an investment to ensure our \\nemployees and others are protected. Wearing a mask is an act of appreciation \\nand love for other people. This resolution is urging business owners to protect \\ntheir people and others and protect the economy of their own businesses by \\nusing masks, face shields, hand sanitizers and sanitized wipes. If we have a \\nculture of protection, we will find it will pay benefits. \\n \\nSHANNON CHAMBERS (Labor Commissioner, Department of Business and Industry): \\nI fully support this resolution, and at the Office of the Labor Commissioner, we \\nissue  mandatory  bulletins  and  guidance  to  employers  who  look  to  us  for \\nguidance on all types of issues including Covid-19. I think this is a wonderful \\nidea, and to the extent it passes, I will make every effort to educate employers \\nand make sure it is posted. The public health situation is an issue we all need to \\naddress, and it certainly impacts labor. Over the past 12 months, this has been \\na huge function of our Office. I support this resolution and will make every \\neffort to do what is required once the resolution is passed. \\n \\nVICTORIA CARREON (Administrator, Division of Industrial Relations, Department of \\nBusiness and Industry): \\nOur agency includes Nevada  OSHA which has  been at the forefront of the \\nCovid-19  enforcement  effort.  The  Safety,  Consultation  and  Training  Section \\nprovides free safety, training and technical assistance to employers. Providing \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 11, 2021 \\nPage 3 \\n \\nPPE is a requirement under the Code of Federal Regulations. Face coverings are \\nnot technically considered PPE; however, Nevada OSHA is requiring employers \\nto provide face coverings to employees as part of its guidelines to complement \\nthe Governor's directives. \\n \\nOur  Safety,  Consultation  and  Training  Section  conducts  monthly  classes  on \\nPPE, has an outreach list of 2,500 people interested in safety issues for both \\nemployers and employees, and uses an email list from the SilverFlume Nevada's \\nBusiness  Portal  database  with  over  32,000  people.  We  would  be  happy  to \\ncomply with S.C.R. 1 and would like to ensure that Nevada employees receive \\nall the PPE they should have to protect themselves and others. \\n \\nSENATOR HARDY: \\nThe Safety, Consultation and Training Section has three offices, in Reno, Elko \\nand Las Vegas, which are reaching out to do what they can. It is admirable that \\nwe have made this decision to protect each other and our businesses and return \\nourselves to an economy as vibrant as it was before. \\n \\nCHAIR RATTI: \\nSenator Hardy, are you open to cosponsors? \\n \\nSENATOR HARDY: \\nI  would  be  thrilled  and  complimented  if  anyone  wants  to  sign  on  to  this \\nresolution.  I  do  not  think  we  can  do  enough.  If  we  want  to  make  a  good \\ndecision and be a good example to people, I would invite anyone and everyone \\nto sign on to this. Something that urges by example is a good idea. \\n \\nSENATOR SPEARMAN: \\nI will sign on. \\n \\nCHAIR RATTI: \\nI would also like to sign on as a cosponsor. Would anyone else? Since everyone \\nhas indicated agreement, we will send this resolution forward, first sponsored \\nby  Senator  Hardy  and  the  entire  Senate  Committee  on  Health  and  Human \\nServices. \\n \\nHearing no public testimony, I will close the hearing on S.C.R. 1 and entertain a \\nmotion from Senator Spearman. \\n \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 11, 2021 \\nPage 4 \\n \\nSENATOR HARDY: \\nMay I ask that S.C.R. 1 be amended to add all the cosponsors? \\n \\nERIC ROBBINS (Counsel): \\nYou can add the cosponsors as an amendment to the resolution. \\n \\n  SENATOR SPEARMAN MOVED TO AMEND AND DO PASS S.C.R. 1. \\n \\n  SENATOR KIECKHEFER SECONDED THE MOTION. \\n \\n  THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. \\n \\n* * * * * \\n \\nCHAIR RATTI: \\nI will open the hearing on Senate Bill (S.B.) 61. \\n \\nSENATE BILL 61: Revises provisions governing the program for the operation of \\nvending facilities by licensees who are blind. (BDR 38-320) \\n \\nSHELLEY  HENDREN  (Administrator,  Rehabilitation  Division,  Department  of \\nEmployment, Training and Rehabilitation): \\nI  present  S.B.  61  which  proposes  changes  to  Nevada  Revised  Statutes \\n(NRS) 426, the statutes related to the Blind Business Enterprise of Nevada (BEN) \\nProgram. I will read from my written testimony (Exhibit B). I have also submitted \\nthe proposed amendments to the bill (Exhibit C). \\n \\nSENATOR HARRIS: \\nI have a question about limiting it to two vending facilities as training sites. Can \\nyou explain why it is limited to two, and are you worried that it might affect \\nwho is able to participate? \\n \\nMS. HENDREN: \\nWe  are  limiting  it  to  two  because  we  do  not  want  to  have  the  Bureau  of \\nServices to Persons Who Are Blind or Visually Impaired take up too many sites \\nthat could be awarded to blind licensees. We see the benefit of having training \\nsites and people being able to get specific on-the-job training. We offer this and \\nsome of our licensees host other trainees, but the idea of a training site is more \\ncontrolled, and potential employees can get quality experience there. The limit \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 11, 2021 \\nPage 5 \\n \\nof two is because if we had viable sites, we want our licensees to own and \\noperate them and reap the benefits. \\n \\nSENATOR HARRIS: \\nMy next question is about section 14 in S.B. 61. I understand there is a fee that \\nwill be paid, and it looks like the licensees will be paying now. Who paid the \\nfees before? It looks like it is an incentive paid by the licensee? \\n \\nMS. HENDREN: \\nYes, it is an incentive, and we wanted to have flexibility where appropriate to \\npay incentives. The set-aside fund is strictly limited on what can be paid out; \\nincentive is the only means to do so. We modeled this after Tennessee law \\nwhere that state is doing this. Licensees cannot be charged typical fees such as \\nrent, fees or assessments. We added the incentive to give ourselves flexibility \\nwith  our  partners,  if  appropriate.  As  this  section  says,  this  is  optional  and \\nnegotiable, and both parties must agree. The Bureau, upon opening a vending \\nfacility to a department or agency, cannot be contingent upon payment of an \\nincentive. \\n \\nRICHARD SAPERSTEIN (Chair, Nevada Committee of Blind Vendors): \\nI have been in the BEN Program for 33 years. The amendments to NRS 426 are \\nimportant. They align the State Program to the federal program and help solidify \\nthe  perpetuity  of  the  BEN  Program.  I  do  not  know  how  many  Committee \\nmembers know the history of the BEN Program. In 1985 when I began losing \\nmy sight, I had no idea what I was going to do. I was college-educated, a \\ndistrict manager for a pizza chain, and the food and beverage director at Circus \\nHotel Casino. This Program has helped me immensely to become successful and \\nmaintain my financial standing. The Program has done this for many others as \\nwell. I support the Program in every way I can, and I encourage the Committee \\nto  adopt  these  amendments  so  people  in  the  future  will  have  a  solid  BEN \\nProgram that will help them achieve the same things it helped me achieve. \\n \\nIVAN DELGADO: \\nI am from Las Vegas and a blind business owner. I have been in the business for \\nfive years and it has been a blessing. I finished high school but had not much \\nelse going for myself. Luckily, I got to take advantage of the Program. These \\namendments are needed and I support the bill. \\n \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 11, 2021 \\nPage 6 \\n \\nDAVID CHERRY (City of Henderson): \\nWe met with the bill sponsors to discuss the City's concerns regarding proposed \\nchanges in S.B. 61. The amendment presented today begins to address some of \\nthe  issues  we  outlined;  however,  we  remain  opposed  at  this  time.  We \\nappreciate continuing to work with Administrator Hendren and her team. The \\nCity  already  offers  blind  entrepreneurs  in  the  BEN  Program  business \\nopportunities  at  multiple  City  facilities  and  recognizes  the  benefits  of  the \\nProgram  for  those  it  serves.  Our  main  concern  is  to  retain  a  system  that \\nmaintains  the  consent-based  framework  in  the  statutes  when  determining  if \\nvending services are needed and, if so, what type. \\n \\nWe want to see stronger protections when it comes to existing leases obtaining \\nwaivers.  There  should  be  certainty  when  people  make  large  investments  or \\nenter  into  partnership  agreements  to  operate  the  facilities  on  City  property. \\nThese waivers should enjoy statutory protection with a defined process in law. \\n \\nThere  are  also  concerns  regarding  the  authority  to  void  contracts  that  is \\nincluded in S.B. 61. We oppose the change away from the existing 30-day \\nnotice period. This has proven sufficient in the past, and moving to a further \\nwindow does not provide adequate time to fulfill this requirement. The City \\nappreciates  the  bill  sponsor's  amendment  that  defines  an  exception  from \\nNRS 426  requirements  when  a  lease  is  granted  to  an  operator  for  live \\nentertainment purposes. The amendment offers a narrow definition that could \\npreclude private entities that provide different types of activities and levels of \\nservice for sizable financial resources. The BEN Program cannot compete with \\ntheir sizeable financial resources by its own acknowledgement. \\n \\nWe urge the Committee to review statute language preserved in the bill that \\nmakes it a misdemeanor crime if someone delivers a sandwich or pizza ordered \\nby a worker in a building where there is a BEN Program operator who sells the \\nsame products. This is outdated and unnecessary. We feel it could also apply to \\na parent selling candy on behalf of a child's activity. We think at a minimum we \\nshould remove the misdemeanor penalty and handle it through an administrative \\nprocess that does not rely on some type of a criminal penalty. The exceptions \\nare limited to only certain types of entities that would qualify. While you already \\nhave some exceptions that you would think cover the candy sales I mentioned, \\nit depends on the type of activity—let us say a dance team or sports activity. If \\nthese are not incorporated in a certain way under NRS, they would not enjoy \\nthat exemption. \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 11, 2021 \\nPage 7 \\n \\nJOANNA JACOB (Clark County): \\nWe  oppose  this  bill  and  have  had  conversations  with  the  Division  of \\nEmployment,  Training  and  Rehabilitation  (DETR)  regarding  our  concerns. \\nClark County  partners  with  DETR  on  the  BEN  Program,  and  is  working  to \\nexpand access within the County wherever we can. Something unique to the \\nCounty we need to work through are questions from McCarran International \\nAirport, which falls under our County Department of Aviation. The Airport has \\ninput from the Federal Aviation Administration on this bill. There are concerns \\nraised that we were not able to work through about federal regulations and \\nrequirements. Particularly, preemptions are in place with different transportation \\nguidelines and concerns because airports are supported by user fees, which are \\nusually prohibited from diversion to other purposes. \\n \\nWe believe we can work this through and have already raised these concerns \\nwith Ms. Hendren. We are concerned section 7 was drafted a little broadly, but \\nit could be interpreted to apply to existing contracts. We understand it was not \\nthe sponsor's intent, and we presented an idea to make that section applicable \\nto contracts entered into after this bill passes. \\n \\nWe  also  have  concerns  about  the  use  of  third-party  vendors.  The  way \\nsection 11, subsection 7 was drafted, the language looks like it was going to \\nallow  third-party  vendors  to  take  on  licensee  responsibilities.  We  now \\nunderstand DETR is looking to narrow third-party vendors, and this section is \\nnot intended to open up opportunities to a whole host of third-party vendors. \\nWe are going to work on clarification and bring it back to this Committee. \\n \\nDAVID DAZLICH (Vegas Chamber): \\nI oppose this bill. My colleagues at Clark County and the City of Henderson \\nhave illustrated well the objections that the Vegas Chamber has with this bill. \\nOur concern is for those private entities operating leases on public property, and \\nwe too would like to see stronger language protecting the waivers in statute. \\nMs. Hendren's amendments are going in the right direction. We look forward to \\nremoving our opposition as we work through this bill. \\n \\nCHAUNSEY CHAU-DUONG (Las Vegas Valley Water District): \\nI want to share comments regarding our opposition to S.B. 61. We recently \\nsigned  an  agreement  with  the  DETR  BEN  Program  to  provide  services  for \\nemployees, and that process went well. A conceptual amendment provided by \\nDETR addresses some of the concerns we have. We want to work with DETR \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 11, 2021 \\nPage 8 \\n \\nregarding section 7, which could still grant DETR exclusive discretion regarding \\nwhat locations are appropriate for vending facilities.  Section 11, which requires \\npublic entities to cooperate with DETR, makes such a determination. As a public \\nentity, we should be able to make these determinations ourselves, particularly in \\ninstances when the vending facility exclusively serves employees. The language \\nshould be clarified responding to Covid-19; we appreciate the ability to make \\nchanges to our limited food service options and to adapt to the pandemic. We \\nwould be happy to work with DETR to obtain answers to our questions and \\naddress our concerns. \\n \\nKELLY CROMPTON (City of Las Vegas): \\nThe City of Las Vegas opposes S.B. 61 but supports the Program since we have \\nbeen  a  partner  and  gone  through  the  process  during  the  construction  of \\nCity Hall. We believe the proposed amendment is a good starting point. The \\nmajority of our concerns have been addressed by the City of Henderson and \\nClark County, so I will leave our opposition at that. \\n \\nARIELLE EDWARDS (City of North Las Vegas): \\nThe City of North Las Vegas opposes S.B. 61 and echoes the remarks made by \\nour colleagues from Clark County and the City of Henderson. \\n \\nSTEVE COHEN: \\nI am testifying in a neutral position. Granted this argument is made in a policy \\ncommittee, but during Covid-19, most of the government facilities that would \\nbe a beneficiary of this Program are closed to the public. I fully support the \\ninclusion of people with disabilities in the general workforce. \\n \\nMS. HENDREN: \\nI appreciate the comments and am open to and available to work with those \\nentities and hopefully find a solution that works for everyone. Our position is to \\npromote the Program and opportunities it provides for individuals who are blind \\nto be entrepreneurs Statewide. This is an old Program, having been on the \\nbooks for 85 years federally and over 60 years in Nevada. Certainly, I would not \\nlike to make changes that do not benefit the Program or blind licensees.  There \\nare areas we could clear up and compromises we could make, such as waivers \\nand potentially NRS 426.715 regarding misdemeanors.  \\n \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 11, 2021 \\nPage 9 \\n \\nCHAIR RATTI: \\nI did hear from people who were in opposition in advance of the hearing. I want \\nto  note  this  hearing  was  scheduled  early  in  the  Session  on  relatively  short \\nnotice. I appreciate the interest and the stakeholders working together to move \\nthis bill. It is an important Program, and we want to make sure we get it right. I \\nhave  asked  the  local  government  representatives  to  work  together.  Perhaps \\nthere  could  be  one  group  voice  as  opposed  to  six  or  seven  separate \\nconversations. I hope to help our team at DETR make it through the amendment \\nprocess. We look forward to hearing back on your resolutions. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRemainder of page left intentionally blank; signature page to follow. \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 11, 2021 \\nPage 10 \\n \\nCHAIR RATTI: \\nThere being no further questions, we will close the meeting on S.B. 61. \\n \\nHearing no public comment, the meeting is adjourned at 4:34 p.m. \\n \\nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \\n \\n \\n   \\nNorma Mallett, \\nCommittee Secretary \\n \\nAPPROVED BY: \\n \\n \\n   \\nSenator Julia Ratti, Chair \\n \\nDATE:     \\nSenate Committee on Health and Human Services \\nFebruary 11, 2021 \\nPage 11 \\n \\nEXHIBIT SUMMARY \\nExhibit  Begins \\nBill   Witness / Entity  Description \\nLetter  on Page \\n  A  1    Agenda \\nShelley Hendren/ \\nDepartment of \\nS.B. 61  B  1  Presentation \\nEmployment, Training \\nand Rehabilitation \\nShelley Hendren/ \\nDepartment of \\nS.B. 61  C  1  Proposed Amendment \\nEmployment, Training \\nand Rehabilitation \\n \"]"
